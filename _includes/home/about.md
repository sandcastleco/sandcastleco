Sandcastle is a creative studio by [Foster Douglas](https://www.instagram.com/fosterdouglas_/){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" }. We care about creativity, education, and the wide world of design, supporting projects focused on collaboration, community building, and innovation.

Our strive: to practice creativity by making meaningful things, help other people grow their creative skills, never stop learning, and make the world a more beautiful and conscious place. We're hands-on, work on projects that we're genuinely excited about, and are devoted to understanding your vision and helping you realize it.

Foster is based in Oakland, California and his most recent favorite coffee is from [Pilcrow](http://pilcrowcoffee.com){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" }. He splits his time between his hometown of Green Bay, WI (where he recently opened [Cura Coffeehouse](http://instagram.com/curacoffeehouse){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" }) and the Sandcastle studio in Oakland.  He was recently nominated to serve on the board of the [Bay Area Coffee Community](https://hellobacc.org){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" }.
