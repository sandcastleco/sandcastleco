Sandcastle is a creative studio by [Foster Douglas](https://www.instagram.com/fosterdouglas_/){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="\_blank" }, all about creativity, education, and the wide world of design. We support projects focused on collaboration, community building, and the humanities.

Our strive: practice creativity by making meaningful expressions, help other people grow their creative skills, keep learning, stay humble, and make the world a more beautiful and conscious place. We're hands-on with projects that we're genuinely excited about, and devote ourselves to understanding the communities around us.

Foster is based across Berkeley, California and London, UK. He can be found in the closet kitchen brewing the perfect cup of coffee, and [making other things](https://foster-douglas.com){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="\_blank" }.
