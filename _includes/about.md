Sandcastle is a web design studio by [Kevin McGillivray](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.link.dim } and [Foster Douglas](http://twitter.com/_fosterdouglas){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.link.dim }. Sandcastle’s mission is to enthusiastically support creative projects that make communities more beautiful, mindful, healthy, unique, kind, and exciting. We work with independent, creative people and businesses on projects focused on education, community building, and unique, creative ideas.

We're a hands-on duo and we work on projects that we are thoroughly enthusiastic about—that means we'll understand your vision and help you push it even further to make it a reality. We're also dedicated to the craft and art of the web, which means you'll have a website you love that will grow with you.

We've been collaborators for over a decade, and everything we've done and explored has shared the same overall drive: use and practice our creative skills to make unique, meaningful things, help other people use and develop their creative skills, never stop learning and exploring, and make the world a more beautiful, mindful place.

Foster's recent favorite coffee is from Spyhouse in Minnesota. Kevin's recent favorite tea is Pure Bud Golden Snail from What-Cha. Keep an eye out here for our upcoming coffee and tea blog!
