## A tiny studio made of sand

Sandcastle is a web design studio by [Kevin McGillivray](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg){: .sand.link.dim } and [Foster Douglas](http://twitter.com/_fosterdouglas){: .sand.link.dim }. Sandcastle’s mission is to enthusiastically support creative projects that make communities more beautiful, mindful, healthy, unique, kind, and exciting. We work with **independent, creative people and businesses** on projects focused on **education, community building, and unique, creative ideas.**

We're a hands-on duo and we work on projects that we are thoroughly enthusiastic about—that means we'll understand your vision and help you push it even further to make it a reality. We're also dedicated to the craft and art of the web, which means you'll have a website you love that will grow with you.

We've been collaborators for over a decade, and everything we've done and explored has shared the same overall drive: use and practice our creative skills to make unique, meaningful things, help other people use and develop their creative skills, never stop learning and exploring, and make the world a more beautiful, mindful place.

Foster's recent favorite coffee is from Spyhouse in Minnesota. Kevin's recent favorite tea is Pure Bud Golden Snail from What-Cha. Keep an eye out here for our upcoming coffee and tea blog!
