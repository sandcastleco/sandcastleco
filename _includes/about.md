Sandcastle is [Kevin McGillivray](http://twitter.com/kev_mcg){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" } and [Foster Douglas](http://twitter.com/_fosterdouglas){: .bg-light-gray.ocean.ph1.no-underline.dim-2 target="_blank" }. We care about creativity, education, and mindfulness. We enthusiastically support projects focused on education, community building, and unique, creative ideas.

We've been collaborators for over a decade, and everything we've done together has shared the same overall drive: practice creativity by making unique, meaningful things, help other people grow their creative skills, never stop learning, and make the world a more beautiful, mindful place. We're a hands-on duo, and we work on projects that we're thoroughly enthusiastic aboutâ€”that means we'll understand your vision and help you push it even further to make it a reality.

Foster's recent favorite coffee is from Spyhouse in Minnesota. Kevin's recent favorite tea is Pure Bud Golden Snail from What-Cha. Keep an eye out here for our upcoming coffee and tea blog!
