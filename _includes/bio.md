# A tiny studio made of sand

Sandcastle is Kevin McGillivray and Foster Douglas. We care about creativity, mindfulness, and education.

As lifelong collaborators, our work is motivated by a consistent overall drive: to apply and develop our creative skills through unique, meaningful projects, help other people use and develop their creative skills, never stop learning and exploring, and make the world a little more beautiful, mindful, and interesting.

Right now, we're focused on Code Convoy, making games, helping independent, creative people and businesses share their work, and brewing as much tea and coffee as we can get our hands on.
