		<p>Nov 24, 2014 by Kevin</p>
		<p>Sharing stuff is hard. To flip the switch from “I’m sitting by myself and my best friend and we’re making this thing that we think is cool” to “Hey, you over there, do you think this is cool?” is really hard. Because it means you have to be really vulnerable.</p>

<p>But it’s only scary right before the jump. And then you’re on the ground, surrounded by the people who care about the things you care about. Who want to be part of a community with you. Who want to go on an adventure with you. And that’s when the party starts.</p>

<p>So welcome to the Sandcastle website. It’s just me and Foster right now, but I hope you’ll join us and come back regularly and hang out. We’re making a game right now called <a href="/underground">Underground</a>. But more importantly, we like talking about creativity, games, music, art, movies, design and the ridiculously hard and ridiculously cool parts of making those things. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do here.</p>

<p>Over time we’ll be adding to this site, but for now let’s talk on Twitter. I’m <a href="http://twitter.com/kev_mcg">@kev_mcg</a>, he’s <a href="https://twitter.com/foster_stilp">@foster_stilp</a>.</p>
