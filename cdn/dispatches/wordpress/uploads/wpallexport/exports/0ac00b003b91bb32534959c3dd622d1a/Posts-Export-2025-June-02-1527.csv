<p><strong>When Mitch Landrieu, </strong>the white Mayor of the Black-majority city of New Orleans, led a push to remove four Confederate statues from city property in 2017, he could not find a local company to do the work. A contractor received death threats, and his car was firebombed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Landrieu got the statues down. The first to be removed, that of Confederate general P.G.T. Beauregard, was taken away in the middle of the night, by workers wearing bullet-proof vests and covered by sniper units on nearby rooftops. Twenty-five days later, on May 19th (coincidentally, yet interestingly, the birthday of Malcolm X) Robert E. Lee came down in broad daylight. Landrieu made an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csMbjG0-6Ak"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csMbjG0-6Ak"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">address on the occasion</a> that was profound, powerful, and wise.

<p>History shapes identity, and American identities—like all human identities—are tribal. The challenge of an enlightened modern culture is to expand the boundaries of the tribe, and sometimes that does happen. It’s been a long, slow struggle in this country to find a way of presenting history that is honest, just, and helpful—a struggle that has recently gathered momentum in the face of committed opposition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The defenders of the Confederacy have not been easily taught, and have often insisted that they are not defending a culture of white supremacy, but rather history itself; for without these monuments, how would we know ourselves, know what formed us as a nation? The apolitical objectivity of this theory of physical history is resoundingly validated, of course, by the statues of Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, Nat Turner and John Brown, that fill the institutional and public spaces of the American South.</p>

But resistance to re-examining the legacy of the Confederacy is only one particular type of denialism. Often white supremacy is defended with a slippery slope argument: let them tear down Stonewall Jackson today, and they’ll be tearing down George Washington and Christopher Columbus tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All conservatives and all Republicans profess horror at the idea that Washington and the Founders should or could be torn down, and spit contempt for those who are complacent about the possibility. Some anti-Confederates have tried to reassure the conservatives on where we are headed. Jamelle Bouie, among others, has made the point that Washington and Jefferson are revered <a href=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/08/trumps-comparison-of-lees-statue-to-washington-and-jefferson-is-wrong.html"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2017/08/trumps-comparison-of-lees-statue-to-washington-and-jefferson-is-wrong.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">not because they were slaveholders, but in spite of that fact</a>; whereas Lee is revered <em>because</em> he fought for slavery, and for no other reason. Bouie is rational and generous, but the fear of Washington’s demotion makes sense, in a way that those who feel this fear cannot acknowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How big a leap is it, really, to go from objecting to statues of those who fought for slavery to objecting to statues of those who merely <a href=""https://www.powells.com/book/never-caught-the-washingtons-relentless-pursuit-of-their-runaway-slave-ona-judge-9781501126413"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.powells.com/book/never-caught-the-washingtons-relentless-pursuit-of-their-runaway-slave-ona-judge-9781501126413"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">owned slaves and brutally enforced slavery</a>, as Washington did; or who indeed <a href=""https://www.powells.com/book/christopher-columbus-the-conquest-of-paradise-9781845111540"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.powells.com/book/christopher-columbus-the-conquest-of-paradise-9781845111540"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">established vast new systems of slavery</a>, as Columbus did? There is as yet no national consensus on taking down Washington’s statues. But if there are occasional defacements, if there is a movement to reject the very Father of Our Nation, this is neither a surprising nor an illogical development. There remains a legitimate question: <em>Why</em>, after all, should <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/opinion/george-washington-confederate-statues.html"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/opinion/george-washington-confederate-statues.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a man who owned slaves</a> be on our national currency?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is certainly an argument that the Founders, in their wisdom if not their practices, set us on the path to being a nation of civil and human rights, if only aspirationally so. It is not wrong to be glad of that. There’s also this: slavery ended throughout the British Empire in 1838, 27 years earlier than it did in the United States. Given an enslaved American population of around <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010169/black-and-slave-population-us-1790-1880/"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1010169/black-and-slave-population-us-1790-1880/"" target=""_blank"">2.4 million in that year that grew to around 4 million in 1865</a>, that 27-year gap represents something like 800,000,000,000 stolen person-hours. Stolen life-hours. Shall we expect African Americans to celebrate Washington’s victory over the British, as the price of full participation in the symbolism of our national life?</p>

<p><strong>What’s </strong>at stake for the conservatives is the very idea of “<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/American_exceptionalism"" target=""_blank"">American Exceptionalism</a>” (and its close cousins, the Shining City on a Hill, Manifest Destiny, the Indispensable Nation, call it what you will): the God-given, glorious specialness of a people born to freedom and led by visionaries who created a nation of singular justice, individual autonomy, and moral right. This idea is much more insidious, and much more accepted, than Confederate sentimentalism. It is far more entrenched in respectable circles. Any <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.powells.com/book/myth-of-american-exceptionalism-9780300164190"" target=""_blank"">challenge to this idea</a> is an existential red line for those who don’t think that America needs fundamental change, those who believe that the Civil Rights legislation of the 1960s redeemed our historical debt to slavery and that markets—if we could only let them flourish!—<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.powells.com/book/capitalism-freedom-fortieth-anniversary-edition-9780226264219"" target=""_blank"">should be left to take care of any remaining racial barriers</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was America successful because “<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""http://american-exceptionalism.org/what-is-american-exceptionalism/"" target=""_blank"">our founders and their successors succeeded admirably in creating a nation in which individual freedom set the stage for unprecedented levels of human accomplishment</a>,” as the far-right Heartland Institute would have it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What if America is <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/the-myth-of-american-exceptionalism/"" target=""_blank"">not in fact</a> “great because she is good,” in the formulation commonly but mistakenly attributed to the French observer Alexis de Tocqueville? What if the Founders were not actually that committed to general human freedom, and the American founding and its results were less a radical, exceptional experiment in individual dignity than a grubby alliance between American colonists, who felt entitled to the freedoms of English gentlemen, and the power of the whip—in the context of the vast riches of a newly-conquered territory, extracted by forced labor, with open physical and economic spaces and thus opportunities that attracted talent and free labor from around the world? If this narrative is simplistic, it is less so than that of the “great because good” school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If American exceptionalism is important to American conservatives, if they believe that American political validity rests upon it, it is even more an article of faith for those—led by a president who saw “<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/"" target=""_blank"">very fine people</a>” among neo-Confederates defending a Robert E.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The confluence of traditional conservative fealty to exceptionalism and the darker tones of tribalism has given license to a fearful and cynical non-sequitur: those who question the legacy of the American founding hate America and want to destroy it.

<p><strong>Let’s </strong>turn<strong> </strong>now to Mount Rushmore, and to President Donald Trump’s weaponization of American Exceptionalism in the speech he gave at the monument on July 3, 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a way, Trump—<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q7S0qhCzCA"" target=""_blank"">who idolizes dictators and aspires to their powers</a>—should feel right at home at Rushmore. As <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.amazon.com/Mount-Rushmore-Reconsidered-Nation-Books/dp/1560254637/"" target=""_blank"">I’ve written elsewhere</a>, enormous statuary is inherently intimidating, and intended to be so; Rushmore has a certain aesthetic vaguely suggestive of the oppressive piles of Socialist Realist monuments. The point of such monuments is to set history literally in stone, to deny any but the official interpretation, forever and ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-south-dakotas-2020-mount-rushmore-fireworks-celebration-keystone-south-dakota/"" target=""_blank"">Trump’s Rushmore speech</a> went well beyond traditional Independence Day patriotic bromides to signal his hostility to any nuanced view of history. The speech took for granted that American Exceptionalism, in its most chauvinistic reading, is the obvious truth of America. He did not merely proclaim America the greatest country in the world, and its people the greatest people in the world; he echoed the paranoia of the radical right that any attempt to re-evaluate the public honors given to our historical leaders exemplifies “far-left fascism”; that anyone who wishes to correct an ahistorical narrative—or to remind us that certain revered leaders have less-than-admirable résumés of slave ownership and mass murder—hates this country and is part of a movement “waging a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children.” In an Independence Day speech, Trump caricatured and defamed significant numbers of Americans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also cleverly framed an implied, unspoken meaning for his followers, designed to entrap critics who remarked on it. This trap was successful. In commentary following the speech, Senator Tammy Duckworth said that Trump had used his words to honor “<a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://youtu.be/tcSioXuQosU?t=120"" target=""_blank"">dead traitors</a>”—that is, Confederates. At Rushmore, Trump did no such thing, as the radical right-wing media <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/senator-duckworth-and-most-of-the-press-are-lying-about-trumps-speech/"" target=""_blank"">screamed in a multi-voiced chorus</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Trump has <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/346929-trump-revives-defense-of-confederate-monuments"" target=""_blank"">defended Confederate memorials for years</a>, and had, only a few days prior, absolutely refused to even consider renaming military bases named for Confederates, <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-confederate-statues-national-defense-authorization-act/"" target=""_blank"">even going so far as to threaten not to sign a military spending bill if it required this</a>. He <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/24/politics/trump-erupted-esper-defacto-ban-on-confederate-flag/index.html"" target=""_blank"">was furious that the Defense Department banned the Confederate flag on military bases</a>.&nbsp; His favorite president, Andrew Jackson—whom Trump praised in the Rushmore speech, whose memorial Trump defended—was not only a slave owner, but also the sole American president known to have <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/08/andrew-jackson-mississippi-statue-removed/"" target=""_blank"">personally driven a slave coffle</a>. When Trump said “Those who seek to erase our heritage want Americans to forget our pride and our great dignity, so that we can no longer understand ourselves or America’s destiny,” his neo-Confederate supporters, the outright white supremacists, could take comfort. And were meant to do so. It is disingenuous of the far-right media to pretend not to know this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mount Rushmore was a good place for Trump to make the transition from defending Confederates to defending American Exceptionalism, to take a stand for an imaginary national history of freedom and justice for all. Like the statues of Confederates, slave owners, and persecutors of indigenous peoples that he defends, Rushmore is problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although officially the mountain sculpture memorializes “the foundation, preservation, and expansion of the United States of America,” its creator, Gutzon Borglum, always had grander things in mind. He wanted to tell a glorious story of the Western European heritage and its gifts to the New World. He thought that he was carving obvious truths into stone, truths that would endure unquestioned for a million years. In reflecting on the meaning of Rushmore, he wrote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Too little has been thought—too little written, on the wide freedoms secured, the virgin worlds offered—unpeopled, untilled, ungoverned—the nomads incapable of resisting even the unorganized aggression of the invaders. No one HAS sung, painted or carved adequately the story of this irresistible God-man movement that fled its ancient moorings… following the sun into the unknown west—into the night! (Gutzon Borglum, writing in <em>The San Francisco Examiner</em>, 22 February 1934)

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">It gets worse. Borglum was a virulent racist and anti-Semite, and his belief in racial hierarchy was central to his ideas about world history—a theme he addressed in voluminous private letters, notes, and political proposals, although rarely in public. He joined the Ku Klux Klan after being recruited, in 1915, to work on the <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain#Confederate_Memorial"" target=""_blank"">Confederate Memorial at Stone Mountain</a>, Georgia, where the modern Klan had been re-founded that same year. He served on a Klan council—a “Kloncilium”—charged with developing a national program for the organization, a task to which he contributed many thousands of words. Although he left the Klan in 1925, after taking the wrong side in an internal power struggle, his thoughts from this period are congruent with his well-documented, lifelong beliefs. In an unpublished essay from 1923, he wrote lines that Donald Trump—with his stated preference for immigrants from Norway rather than those from <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-protections-for-immigrants-from-shithole-countriesin-oval-office-meeting/2018/01/11/bfc0725c-f711-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html"" target=""_blank"">“shithole countries” in Africa and the Caribbean</a>—might well approve:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Beyond </strong>the philosophical roots of the undertaking, there is an obvious irony in carving a sculpture popularly known as the “Shrine of Democracy” into a mountain in the Black Hills, sacred to the Lakota Sioux. The Lakota claim to the Hills had been recognized in treaties of 1851 and 1868. In 1877 the treaty of 1868 was forcibly renegotiated after gold was discovered there, and the Lakota lost the heart of their lands and were confined to dusty reservations on the plains. In 1890 a band of Lakota refugees led by Spotted Elk (Big Foot) was massacred by American soldiers at Wounded Knee—men, women, children, many chased down in the snow by soldiers on horseback as they were trying to escape the slaughter. President Benjamin Harrison awarded the Medal of Honor to twenty American soldiers who took part in the massacre, medals which have never been rescinded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This event closed out the dispossession of the Lakota and the destruction of their power on the Plains. The American government was then regnant. South Dakota was a state of the Union, and miners were tearing up the Black Hills.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The triumphant growth of American power was part of the story of national expansion and national destiny that Borglum later carved in stone. The Lakota were not consulted on this story, and were not able to assert their own story against the power of an alien authority. Indeed, Rushmore embodies the assumption that they did not have a story worth telling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Massacres, conquest, and racism lurk between the lines of Borglum’s published writings on the grand national and racial destiny that he created Rushmore to commemorate. They haunt the monument today. In differing ways and to differing degrees, they scar the legacy of each of the men carved on the mountain. They are an inescapable if unacknowledged part of Rushmore’s meaning, and America’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The single, glorious narrative of America that Borglum envisioned and Trump endorses—one that excludes those who were enslaved, conquered, and dehumanized by our national consolidation—doesn’t work today. We are seeing this now in every American city, town, and rural community, as well as in the lived experience of millions of Americans. Not before time, we are coming to understand that the only history that can be “true” in any meaningful sense is told in many different voices, recounting many different experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald Trump resists this insight. It is inconvenient for his plans to retain power, inconvenient for the very nature and sources of the power he holds. On July 3, 2020, he stood at Mount Rushmore to defend a story that never was, and promise a future that will never be.</p>

<p><strong>At the intersection </strong>of Broadway and 8th Street in Oakland, I watched as police officers fired tear gas at a peaceful crowd of high-school students, mostly Black and people of color. It was early June 2020, and a half an hour before the recently imposed curfew. The sun, still bright, reflected on our messy home-made signs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;As we chanted the names of those recently murdered by the police—George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade—we saw canisters launched into the crowd. This was the first time I’d seen tear gas used in broad daylight. Heavily clad in their riot gear, the police officers looked alien on the familiar street among the teenagers and families. Protestors fled from the gas and the advancing wall of shields. As I rounded the corner in a hurry, the image of a distant, yet strikingly similar scene came to mind.</p>

<p>In August of 2019 and into 2020, photographs of people facing off against soldiers in Kashmir flooded my news and social media feeds.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve never truly encountered, let alone had to confront, this oppressive side of the Indian government that Kashmiris and other minority groups across the country are so familiar with. My childhood in Mumbai was privileged and sheltered. As a Hindu, I only ever heard of the violence perpetrated against Muslims, Indigenous peoples, Dalits, and the country’s many other marginalized communities. Moving to the U.S. as a teenager, I was abruptly doused in the realities of being brown and foreign in a white world. When I experienced this otherness, I thought of the marginalized communities in my home country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the Modi administration began the process of effectively transforming Kashmir into a self-contained prison, I could only watch in horror at my country’s latest mutation towards fascism. India’s home minister proposed in Parliament that Article 370 of the Indian Constitution be overturned. The article, which had guaranteed some semblance of autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir for nearly 70 years, was rescinded within a day. This effectively rendered Kashmir a colony of India, stripping the State of its special status and the right to have its own constitution.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kashmir’s eruption of protests as a response to the August 2019 impositions was a vehement rejection of the Modi administration’s imperialistic action. Much like the protests in the United States, these uprisings were also rooted in Kashmir’s historical oppression and violence that predate India’s very existence as a nation-state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From August 2019 to January 2020, Kashmiris experienced internet blackouts and the shut down of cell phone networks, cable and regional television channels. The resulting months of isolation, surveillance, and the aggressive policing of Kashmiris emphasized the extent to which Kashmir had become India’s neocolonial project. The Indian government stripped communities of access to news and social media, contact with friends and family, and even free movement within their own neighborhoods. Kashmir was effectively cut off from the outside world.</p>

<p><strong>When </strong>global<strong> </strong>Covid-19 infection rates began to rise and India enacted strict travel policies against Non-Resident Indians, I thought of Kashmir. India’s pandemic travel policies gave me a small glimpse into what this experience must have been like. The policies cut me off from my mother—the only member of our family living outside the U.S.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This wasn’t the first time I had been confronted with the alienating quality of borders. As the daughter of an immigrant, I became familiar early on with their cutting edges. My mother did not want to renounce her Indian citizenship, and therefore would never become an American citizen—dual citizenship between the countries is prohibited. And after years in a country that never became familiar, she moved back to Mumbai. I learned quickly that borders keep people apart, a labyrinth of legal documents and forms that my mother would have to stumble through to access my life in the States. Yet, my experience with the pandemic was my first time being barred from home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, unlike Kashmiris, I still had the solace of the internet. My mother and I started cooking together over WhatsApp video calls a few nights a week as if turmeric and garam masala were the antidotes to distance and the rising uncertainty of our reunion. I’d stand at the stove in my cramped Oakland apartment, scooping handfuls of onions from the chopping board to toss into my pan under her watchful eye. She would usually be making her morning chai, boiling ginger, mint, and cardamom. She interrupted our meandering conversations often to suggest additions to my dishes: “more chilies no?” and “have you put enough mustard seed this time?” For a moment I’m back in our kitchen in Mumbai, and the distance dwindles to nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kashmir’s isolation was much deadlier. Families couldn’t call their loved ones for comfort. After the blackouts subsided there was still no reassurance for Kashmiris. Their screens and conversations were surveilled, it seemed someone was always listening in. I will likely never know what it feels like to call my mother and get nothing but a dial tone for months on end. But as I endure the impact of borders, I can begin to imagine this horrifying reality for so many families with relatives on either side of Kashmir's perimeters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes my mother and I talk about Kashmir. She doesn’t want to believe that the Indian government is capable of committing these atrocities, and says that I should be careful not to oversimplify a decades-old conflict. Kashmir is a tangled knot of vested interests. But while the conflict is far from simple, some actions are strikingly clear. Internet blackouts, nationwide blocks against websites like Stand With Kashmir, the policing of the region’s borders—these are clear, decisive maneuvers. My mother has never been one to ignore the obvious, and the Modi administration’s latest actions in Kashmir are impossible to ignore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the violence in the region has extended far beyond these actions. In Kashmir, 8,000 people have been “disappeared,” many likely vanishing into the <a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/india-ordered-probe-3800-mass-graves-kashmir-171103114819966.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615601827660000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OeeaBvLrUARCKYh6ACt8D"" data-type=""URL"" data-id=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/india-ordered-probe-3800-mass-graves-kashmir-171103114819966.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1615601827660000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1OeeaBvLrUARCKYh6ACt8D"" target=""_blank"">mass graves</a> to the north that seem to sprout from the earth like weeds. The Indian military has inflicted night raids, beatings, sexual assaults and mass arrests. They have destroyed crops and shut down public transportation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indian government’s rhetoric around the topic of Kashmir resembles the U.S. government’s responses to Black Lives Matter protests. There is a parallel justification of state-sanctioned brutality and oppression as being necessary for the safety and “goodness” of society. But these justifications raise the question of who constitutes society, and what is being protected. In the midst of isolation, surveillance, and state-sanctioned killings, I am reminded that these struggles are not separate. Solidarity is crucial, a vital precondition to our collective dignity and liberation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This August marks a full year since the start of Kashmir’s lockdown. Though there have been some changes, Kashmiris continue to live in a state of subjugation, their borders still tightly controlled and policed. Modi has claimed this latest episode in India’s long and complicated history with imperialism is being perpetrated by the government for the “good of the Kashmiri people.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>At BLM protests, I listened as police stated over their megaphones that protestors needed to disperse for their own safety. I wondered how we could be the threat and the threatened at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve lived in </strong>the Los Angeles megalopolis my entire life. As a disabled, wheelchair-riding Chicano, I’ve been confined to certain areas of this polluted, sun-soaked expanse determined by the county’s history of urban development and lack of public transit. This meant pushing my chair was the only reliable transportation I could find until, as fortune would have it, I eventually became one of the lucky few disabled guys who drives using private transportation in Los Angeles. I don’t know how many hours I’ve lost to the 405, stuck inside my accessible car. For years, my hired caregivers and I commuted along the 405 from Long Beach to Westwood, regularly exiting on Wilshire (or Sunset) where I spent the better half of my days at UCLA. As I sat in the passenger seat, I would gaze out the window and see the California sun beaming down upon the urban manifestation of social mobility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a few miles along the 405 North, the backdrop ghettos and barrios of the Harbor are interrupted by the beachfront suburbs of South Bay, whose only purpose seems to be to protect West LA from Black and brown bodies with a wall of upper-middle class comfort. During the commute, any watchful passenger can’t miss the sight of the economically disposable and unhoused who have managed to infiltrate the gentrified garrisons of Los Angeles County. The presence of the unhoused, many of whom have some form of disability (physical, mental, or a combination thereof), have caused headaches for homeowners concerned with property values. And the only cure for their headaches is the bludgeon of law and order.</p>

<p>For conservatives, California is a progressive straw man. To those who regularly consume <em>The Joe Rogan Experience </em>or get their opinions from the Shapiro-sphere, California (specifically Los Angeles) is an untenable wasteland à la <em>Blade Runner</em>. Cast as a communist dystopia perdurably burdened by bloated social programs, it is populated en masse by the recycled image of Reagan’s so-called “welfare queens,” who happily dive into Scrooge McDuck piles of government handouts while drug addicts and rapists stalk every corner. My atrophied and contracted fingers have dedicated countless hours chicken-pecking out arguments in online forums, reassuring internet right-wingers that California’s Democrats don’t care about the homeless or disabled any more than they do. The faceless anonymity of the internet doesn’t allow me to see the conservative commentators as they’re introduced to the neoliberal marriage of Republicans and Democrats. But as any devoted internet explorer knows, online political discourse typically devolves into insubstantial retorts that imply anyone with a care for the marginalized is a modern day commissar who obtains sexual gratification by watching their partner carnally ravaged before their own eyes. (Luckily, the good folks at <em>Dispatches</em> have allowed me to present my experiences with little risk of being called a “commie cuck,” and any such accusations should be sent to the official <em>Dispatches</em> email address.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bipartisan </strong>efforts<strong> </strong>to replace the enormous asylums that historically warehoused the mentally ill, like Patton State Hospital in Los Angeles County, with community-based treatment programs began, optimistically enough, during the Kennedy administration. But without sufficient funding to provide care for those who most needed help, the asylums were closed, their inhabitants evicted from the dark corners of state-run facilities and cast out into the streets. Under Reagan, California’s newly-unhoused became a symbol of the budget-balancing capitalist state. The casualties of austerity still huddle along freeway underpasses—the only shadowy respite from the California sun that simultaneously fries oil puddles on the ground and evaporates beads of sweat off uncovered torsos. Los Angeles’s Skid Row, where many of these people seek shelter, now abuts luxury apartments and yuppie wine bars. Overzealous property developers firmly believe “if you build it, the yuppies will come.” They’re not wrong, Los Angeles has always been ready to accept investments from developers, both foreign and domestic. The boutique homogenization has spread all the way from Skid Row to Boyle Heights to Compton and farther south to my current home in Long Beach.</p>

<p>I often push along Long Beach’s downtown promenades, having Hitchcockian encounters with Bird scooters on the ground that serve as green roadblocks for my wheelchair, while black and white ghetto birds hum in the sky and hunt for transgressors. The urban landscapes of my youth have become unrecognizable to me after a single decade of hyperdevelopment.&nbsp;Hauling my paralyzed body around a space I no longer find familiar serves as a reminder that in an age of speculative real estate sustained by destruction and removal, absence is the only thing that’s real.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Corner discount markets have been repainted and refurbished and artisanal boutiques drone with the hustle and bustle of middle class consumption, as the occasional unhoused person briefly manifests themselves from the shade to ask for spare change. Should this tenuous arrangement (predicated on the unwritten and unspoken promise that the economically nonviable remain out of sight) be broken, a nearby squad car will blare its siren and inform all within earshot that capitalist hierarchies must be, and <em>will</em> be enforced by any means necessary. In the case that a flashing of lights and brandishing of batons fails to restore the street to its predetermined order, these infractions are met with physical force. All I can do is watch, a physical and political invalid, incapable of doing anything for himself, let alone rectifying a schematic brokenness extending beyond my spine.</p>

Who better to enforce the new red lines than the boys in blue? As the LAPD reported in January 2020, one-third of all encounters where an officer used force saw the unhoused on the receiving end. While pushing along the street, I do my best to avoid the all-in-one problem-solving cop, dispatched with surplus military hardware to rein in the parasitic guttersnipe. Most would like to believe that a cop would show restraint when confronted with a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed young quad such as myself, but there are plenty of videos online proving otherwise.

<p><strong>Being </strong>a young<strong> </strong>Chicano in a wheelchair in an urban area is a loaded identity rife with assumptions about my disability and its accompanying history. Having suffered a spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis in the midst of my teenage years, my body had time to develop proportionally before affected sections withered from inactivity and neglect. The unaffected moiety is overworked and tightened through physical compensation so that my physique resembles a wounded warrior's. To the able-bodied spectator in a post-9/11 realm, this can only mean I’ve sacrificed my future hopes of normalcy and fulfillment for the perennial American war machine.</p>

<p class=""indented"">I am a weaponized token ready to be deployed by mortgage-paying individuals in any hypothetical about economic reform. I am a biopolitical example of how the urban garrisons are used to protect the uber rich from the destitute. Because the people with mortgages and enough capital to displace their social inferiors have inculcated themselves with the illusion that they are a protected class, invulnerable to being crippled by forces beyond their control like mass shootings, intensifying wildfires, or superviruses.</p>

<p>Comfortable Americans suffer from a collective amnesia regarding recessions and other forms of shock capitalism within their lifetimes. In particular, adherents of the musical entrepreneur and convict Frank “Suge” Knight and Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and the doctrine of disaster capitalism (euphemistically hailed as the “free market”) will argue that the health of a country can be determined by the health of the stock market and the most recent appraisal of their homes. They bother not with the mechanisms that sustain the system. All they know is that most are destined to fail. They say that there is no sickness or infirmity in heaven, so it is their duty as the economic elect to remove the grotesque from their downtown centers and create their own paradise.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately, I find solace in the depressing reminder that punishing the weak and disenfranchised for inconveniencing the rich with their very existence is the story of America. There is nothing new under the California sun. Yet something about this epoch feels different. Maybe it’s the bias of my fixed relativity, but this moment in time contains an intangible sense of eschatological doom. As if the American project is finally submerged under its own excess. The plague of Covid-19 has shown the world that Americans believe the only way to deal with the paralytics, lepers, and dying is to offer empty words of pity and an unwavering commitment to inaction. The initial murmurs that America could never return to a pre-Covid equilibrium have given way to calls for reform. However, almost a year into the much cited “new normal,” technocrats have only managed to extend their profit extraction into our homes as countless Americans synchronously work the sociologist Arlie Hochschild’s double shift. Meanwhile, those same elected officials continue to disregard the mounting human toll and reopen their states with the hope that beleaguered Americans miraculously avoid Covid while still contracting the virus of capitalism.

<p><strong>AT THE CLOSE</strong> <strong>OF APRIL 2020</strong>, having saved enough pent-up curiosity about the national lockdown, I was ready to go to the West Coast. On a warm and clear Tuesday I headed northwest out of New Orleans through Louisiana’s system of intermittent causeways. Traffic was light,  but not quite indicative of societal collapse. Cajuns fished the waterways. A storm had passed ahead of me and its remnants left a great patchwork of cloud cover like giant clawings, as if some massive beast had left its fevered markings on the door to the heavens. The way I saw it, with touchless credit cards and a truckload of precautionary supplies, I was better off social distancing from the confines of my own pickup than stuck in the mayhem of my three-hundred-year-old metropolis. Not everyone I told agreed with me but my mind was made up by then.</p>

<p>It was almost twilight when I reached Shreveport. The scene reminded me of some unscreened detective drama: uneven electrical poles that seem too skinny, heavy foliage that droops that little bit too low, grimy vehicles in various states of disrepair. As I snaked my way through town to rejoin I-49, I stopped at a small intersection. At the corner, a large family had gathered on a porch. Their unmasked faces, stained with suspicion, looked out in my direction. It felt as though the story of their lives had passed through me like sunlight through a looking glass. With my window rolled down, the air thick, there was the smell of damp earth. By Texarkana, I was ready to turn in.</p>

<p class=""indented"">I crossed the Red River at dawn. Furious lightning strikes prodded the cobalt sky as big rigs heaved so many Amazon orders back and forth. Southern Arkansas struck me as beautiful, verdant country. Often it reminded me of rural Poland with its rule of the land: build and do as you may. Shacks and trailers stood alongside or opposite elaborately manicured ranch houses. The absence of any imposed aesthetic uniformity—laying bare everyone’s income levels—had the jarring effect of being at once primitive and compelling. Everywhere, cows and horses grazed. Mist hovered over the grass.</p>

<p>Somewhere near Coalgate, Oklahoma, at the corner of the tree-lined State Route 3, I pulled into an old service station with a gas pump out of the first Bush administration. I’d been tinkering for a while with the wrench to my spare tire hoist when a woman wearing a baseball cap and a bomber jacket over her coveralls approached me.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Long way from home,” she said, glimpsing my truck’s California plates. “Yes and no,” I said, lying that I was from Arkansas. “So you got a handle on it then,” she said wryly. The only other car at the station belonged to a family with small children who waited inside. A few heavy drops of rain. Everyone but me was on a first-name basis, no one but me wore a mask. I waited outside on one of those polypropylene school chairs. When the mechanic called me over to pay, I thanked her and added “Better off safe than sorry.” “‘Specially today.” The wind was picking up something furious again. “You just take care now,” she said and waved me off.</p>

<p><strong>In </strong>Buffalo, Oklahoma, I stopped to photograph the buffalo sculpture that stood bullish in front of the tiny, vacant city hall. Maybe I shouldn’t be taking so many damned photographs, I thought. I could hardly decipher which ramshackle building had been shut down due to the pandemic, and which had simply been abandoned. Throughout the region, so many of these small towns looked to me like they hadn’t seen a good year since the 1990s, let alone the Great Recession. Banners congratulating 2020’s graduates were contrasted by shuttered doorways and cracked windows. The windshield wipers made bleary, picturesque streaks of the silver and powder blue-spotted sky ahead of me.</p>

<p>At the head of Second Ave. and Wyatt Earp Blvd. in Dodge City, Kansas, stands El Capitan, a bronze reproduction of the Texas Longhorn cattle traded in Dodge’s heyday. The 1880s recreation of famous Front Street was tucked away in the “temporarily closed” Boot Hill Museum. What remained of the commercial “front,” apart from boarded up or vacant spaces, was a vape shop, an heladeria, and a Pizza Hut. While traffic filled the wider boulevards that fed in and out of the train yards and the meatpacking plants, the streets of the town were empty.</p>

After unloading the truck, I was welcomed by the stench of urine, paint peeling from my front door, and no bulbs for the bedside lamps. There’s a raw, unpretentious anonymity to motels that has always appealed to me, but this level of drabness was pushing it. I called the front desk, and the Gen Z-aged Latina with the galactic-themed acrylic nails who’d checked me in from behind thick glass re-accomodated me with hardly a hint of surprise. The ‘98 Chevy Malibu sitting on bricks, the plywooded windows across the lot. Did I really expect her to feign shock? I settled into my new room redolent of housekeeping and cigarettes with a pint of Old Grand-Dad and drifted off to the sounds of another roiling thunderstorm.</p>

I listened to a cassette of Bruce Springsteen’s <em>Greatest Hits</em> all through Kansas.

<p>Along Highway 400, indistinguishable towns blew by, each delineated by tall granaries and festooned in the stars-and-stripes, their children on bicycles or playing catch. It made me think of those ‘80s youthquake blockbusters like <em>Red Dawn</em>, <em>The Outsiders</em>—tales of the Heartland and paranoid violence, indivisible. I was in Trump country, county after county swept in 2016 by staggering margins. Historian Peter Onuf described the United States as suffering from a sense of ahistorical exceptionalism, a precarious state of optimism that is shadowed by fears: fear “that the repressed will return,” fear of outside influences “contaminating the republic,” simmering fears which are occasionally turned on high by our leaders for their own benefit. Ours is a nation with a long, uninterrupted history of scapegoating, and there isn’t enough Benjamin Moore paint and fine landscaping in the world to make me think otherwise.</p>

I walked over, camera in hand. “It’s a re-construction, of course,” he said. “But you really oughta visit sometime,” he paused, “when this whole thing blows over.” His mask hung loosely from his neck. All along the trip, people were making vows for when things opened up again. “Kit Carson’s own grandson gives the tours... Or was it his great-grandson?” He went on about Kit before switching to tales of his own traveling son who was somehow relevant to everything I shared. “My son was a waiter. Up in New York. Good work if you can talk to people.”He’d go on for hours if I didn’t get ready to leave and I did so with a touch of regret. He wished me luck and listed off recommendations for how to explore “beautiful Colorado.”</p>

<p>Great clouds ringed the Rockies. I was meeting my buddy Lind and his girlfriend for burgers in Colorado Springs. I pulled off Nevada Avenue into some generic acreage of park and shop fancy that seems to blight all of Colorado’s non-natural scenery like a bad case of the boils. Lind and I had known each other since the days of elementary school two-hand touch and, depending on whom you asked, have been through hell and back. After our meal he suggested we head to nearby Manitou Springs to hike the incline. Like many a reformed addict, he’d taken to fitness regimes with the characteristic vigor that convinces you doing bad stuff is good fun. Halfway up, I was tapped out. I needed a beer. As we prepared for the drive to Boulder, we all promised to return one day to Manitou Springs together. Vows and promises, building by the caseload.</p>

I’d spent three days hiking, drinking, and reminiscing in the small mountain city I once called home years ago. But it didn’t feel much like home this time, either. I never learned to live with the intolerance of the cyclists and the unfriendliness of the hiking trail and I probably never will. It’s hard to imagine this wealthy, socially homogeneous mountain enclave without its general wariness and its peculiar political hypocrisies, but that’s a tale for another time.</p>

Windswept earth, cold and calloused, as far as my eyes could see. This was the isolated ecoregion where the southern Rockies, Northwestern Great Plains and High Plains all meet in arid short grasses and caliche, a rolling mercurial landscape characterized by high contrasts and sallow-tinged light values at home in the pages of science fiction.</p>

<p>When the first cavalries finally crossed the Cordillera only to find the alien redness of the West, the hoodoos and buttes in great basins of a chthonic religiosity, did their courage turn a blind eye to the prospect of calamity? Or, bearing the Protestant ethic to the Ute, the Shoshone, and the Paiute—as the Spanish had with Christ the savior farther west—did they meet this redness with murderous conviction? The answers were everywhere, soaking the soil, in the names of places, in the weathered nobility of Native American faces.</p>

<p>I passed the otherworldly Sinclair refinery in Casper, the second-largest city in Wyoming, with night seeping in like an oil spill. At a rest stop along the state line I tried to sleep while winds howled with undomesticated force around the cab like banshees until dawn.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back on the road, I glimpsed snowfall in pockets along the tree-lined mountains near Park City, Utah and descended to the salt flats of the state capital where I could see the primordial Salt Lake Temple cloaked in morning light. These grandiose Latter Day Saints temples bear no temperate relation to architectural movements of the past. Rather, they stun, rising up to shimmer in the windshield as though planted here from an alternate human history, a spectacle that would not be out of place in Ray Bradbury’s short story “A Sound of Thunder,” in which a time traveler who accidentally trods on a butterfly returns to a world subtly, if remarkably, altered.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to church historians, LDS temples are not places for daily worship, but for particular rituals—rituals for the living and the dead, a place where church members make covenants and bonds they believe will last forever. Surrounded by castellated, fortress-like walls and soaring towers for protection, these temples seemed to reaffirm the brotherhood’s place as outsiders in a hostile world. Begun in 1853, the Salt Lake Temper took forty years to build and was overseen by the Mormon prophet Brigham Young himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the near-hellish landscape around the ghost town of Delle, I stopped at a lone gas station. The attendant looked exhausted, accommodating weary travelers to this desolate outpost with only a nod toward the facilities while she mopped. I ate an orange and some trail mix as I watched three different cars come and go. It wasn’t evil out here, nor was it decrepit. It was merely wretched, a world outwardly informed by Frank Herbert (<em>Dune</em>) and George Miller (<em>Mad Max</em>). A thick, gaseous blue haze hung over the horizon and the light wore a sunburnt glare over the chromium-like sheen of salt that covered the surface. I saw a gray fox scamper about at the edge of the highway with that canine grin and loose tongue that here evoked images of a person dying of thirst.</p>

<p><strong>When </strong>the<strong> </strong>lockdown was setting in I’d read somewhere there was no more un-American sight than an empty grocery shelf. In Nevada, it’s the empty casino parking lot. All the signage de-electrified, the buzz and hum de-personified, I had the strange sensation—not unlike déjà vu—that I was looking at the past from the future. I drove on, following the section of the Old California Trail first explored by Captain Benjamin Bonneville and Joseph R. Walker in 1833. As the highway made its way through the treacherous terrain of Emigrant Pass with tall grasses, rocks, and ravines, I tried to picture their journey via horse and covered wagon, all those days in the heat that was, here in early May, surpassing ninety degrees.</p>

<p>The story of the West is littered with foreigners turned prospectors. Few succeeded but even fewer returned home. A billboard in Elko, Nevada announced the Basque Festival, July 5-7, and at the time, I don’t think anyone considered the pandemic would carry on past June. In northern Nevada, the Basques, also known for their proud seafaring history, took to the solitary pursuit of raising sheep. As they acquired property, they built hotels and trading posts and made a significant mark on the northern Great Basin, perhaps one greater than any place outside Basque country.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the long drive across Nevada, finding a vacant motel in Sparks/Reno proved to be a tall task. The streets outside the city center buzzed with the frantic energy of the hard-edged, the creditless, the in-between three-and-four-time losers. It was as if all the life that’d vacated the casinos had found itself here, in the form of hustlers and the pandemic-displaced scrambling to make good by nightfall. I got a room in a Motel 6 across the street from the vacant livestock center. Signs in the lobby announced: Mandatory Cash Deposit, Pool CLOSED, ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING IN ROOMS. After finagling my way out of the cash deposit, I moved to unload my truck. A fat man emerged from the room next to mine to smoke and scope the scene. The parking lot was packed. He looked up at the second floor landing where I spied a heavyset sex worker frowning indignantly down at him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I left the complex and walked underneath the I-80 overpass, passed the Covid-shuttered Denny’s, and on to the Chevron station for a 24oz Coors. There were over a half-dozen people inside, and the jittery energy reminded me of a convenience store along a parade route. Back in my room I showered, sipped my beer, and ate from a can of sweet corn. My neighbor, smoking another cigarette, ventured a few steps into the parking lot and looked up. I listened to the walls fill with the sounds of muzzled life. I read until I passed out.</p>

<p><strong>Earlier</strong>, on<strong> </strong>my final descent into Washoe County, I glimpsed the Truckee River snake its way alongside the Interstate. Perhaps this was where the West truly began, in these mountains once pregnant with bounties of precious cargo. To my left, there was a little spot of land shaded by a solitary red willow where the river babbled by. Nature, perfect, cradled by herself. I was drawn to think about the land, the soil of this whole continent once more. It gave as much as we could take, and take we did. Joan Didion said the West lacked the conviction to believe anything it did could bloody the land, or change it. Yet here, 172 years from that flicker of light New Jersey carpenter James Wilson Marshall glimpsed, like a trick of the eye, while working on a sawmill in nearby Sutter Creek, and everywhere were the signs and symbols of madness. The West now represents the vicissitudes of our fate, and the Empire teeters on the edge, bloated and half-crazed, having dunked the sun in the sea enough times to resemble a Baptist preacher who’s lost his mind. Driving into the Golden Land, I could no longer assess without apprehension. The specter of ecological collapse suggests that when the Empire eventually falls—as empires always do—it threatens to take the willow tree with it.</p>

<p>I left Reno behind the next morning with the radio blaring on about how Covid-19 had rendered a state of absolute chaos in the world: riots and violence in Nigeria and Lebanon, labor strikes in Mexico, America’s food supply chain was seizing up, the oil surplus, the collapse of the airline industry. As the familiarity of the East Bay’s vast network of Interstates appeared before me, I started to feel faint. Had exhaustion or microbes caught up with me? All the memories hidden among the pockets and folds of the city of Oakland came back to me, all curiously devoid of wonder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up a small hilly street off Broadway I stopped in front of my destination: an eclectic little Rockridge home where my love awaited. But instead of excitement I felt woe. I’d been lured to the edge of America only to ask myself again, now what? Whether I stayed here one day or ten, I knew the only thing left was to head back the other way. There was something cruel and cruelly elusive about this continent. Pilgrims, all of us, now and then would continue to traverse this land unsatisfied, in a frenzied chase of something that flickers indistinct and unfixed—like children chasing fireflies on summer nights—unless something changes. But it was all probably just nothing. Jack had a name for what I was feeling I think, just that end of the land sadness.</p>

<p><strong>Two years ago</strong>,<strong> </strong>returning to Paris after a brief summer jaunt down south and with still no work lined up (I’m a translator/interpreter), I took my wife Emma out to lunch only to see my card declined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here I am, I thought, no longer a young man, with two small children and a negative balance in my bank account. The idea of being a failure in the eyes of my children was unbearable. I could no longer hang out in our tiny kitchen doing lame James Brown imitations while waiting for work to appear. I had to act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought: I am resourceful. I am, after all, American. I went online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few hours later I had an interview set up the next day with Big Bus Tours—the world’s largest open-top bus sightseeing company was looking to hire and train English-language guides for bus tours around Paris. I would be meeting a woman called Maribel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The interview went well, and I memorized 40 pages of material over the weekend, determined to ace the upcoming training period. First I was sent on a tour with one of Big Bus’s top guides, Marie, to get an idea of what would be expected of me. Even after thirty years here (I am a Paris lifer), the tour with Marie bowled me over. For the first time in my life, I gazed down and around at my city from on high, gawking and laughing and loving every minute of it. Marie was petite, charming, French, with pale green eyes; her English was valiant, and her warmth as she worked the mic, walking up and down the aisle of the exposed upper deck handing out earbuds and patiently answering questions, was natural, unfeigned. I fell under her spell and found myself closing my eyes, basking in the sun like a lizard, thinking <em>I can do this</em>, as if it were some esthetic privilege and pursuit and not merely a minimum-wage job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was hired, and within a week was working full-time. Each tour lasted two hours and change. I did three tours daily, five days a week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were about fifteen guides at Big Bus Tours, and the company rewarded us with a ten-euro bonus for each five-star review we got on Tripadvisor. The mesmerizing Derrick, a diminutive caramel-colored Dutchman, was #1; his weekly five-star review tally was staggering. Marie was #2. I came up with a moniker I thought was a surefire winner—<em>5-Star Phil</em>—and was soon coming in third.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got along with everyone at Big Bus Tours, especially the drivers, whose warmth and humor I cherished. The drivers were exclusively Arab, or Black (and all men, save three women), and 95% Muslim (full disclosure: I am a balding middle-aged semi-Jewish atheist white guy idiomatically fluent in French and English).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Downstairs at the shop where the drivers had a toilet, a makeshift kitchen, a table and some armchairs, the prayer mat was in constant use. I shared with my drivers the raisins, nuts and bananas I carried in my fanny pack, and my tips, too—exactly half. My first day on the job, staring amazed at the change in his palm, Abdel said:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where are you from, man?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m French, of course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He arched an eyebrow. No you’re not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A French person never gives anything away. Especially to an Arab!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay, I said. I’m also American.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah! That explains it!</p>

<p><strong>The </strong>weather<strong> </strong>was inordinately, stunningly sunny, and despite copious amounts of sunscreen I was soon sporting the kind of tan I had as a kid in eastern North Carolina. My daughter, Nina, six, was tickled pink. For once, one of her parents left the house in the morning to go to work, like normal parents do; and, icing on the cake, I did it <em>in uniform</em>. Sporting my red and gold cap, jacket, shirt and plastic name tag, I bounded down the stairs every morning before hopping on my 1985 Schwinn Super Le Tour and cycling to Avenue de l’Opéra… I loved going to work, I loved my job, I loved the camaraderie; and I loved riding home at night. Seldom had I been so happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One year later, on one of the last warm days of the season, I was embarking on a tour with Ahmed, one of my favorite drivers, a bloke my age (fifties) with a busted nose, a cigarette habit and warm, witty eyes. We had gone through and around the Louvre when the bus suddenly jerked to a stop in the middle of the Quai du Louvre, about 200 feet from the Pont-Neuf. I rushed downstairs just as an angry young Black man, whose car had also stopped in the middle of the road, ran toward the entrance of our bus, obviously intending to lavish bodily harm on Ahmed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ahmed had already leapt from his driver’s seat and assumed a boxing stance. I stepped between them, yelling:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HEY GUYS! YOU BOTH HAVE KIDS, RIGHT? COME ON! THIS IS BULLSHIT!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both guys were yelling; I was yelling; car horns were blaring. To lay a hand on my driver that man was going to have to go through me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hand of a fellow motorist landed on the young Black man’s shoulder and wrenched him back to his car. As he was being led away, he twisted toward Ahmed and roared:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eat shit, you Arab fuck!</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A </strong>few<strong> </strong>years back I published a novel in French about the boxer Jack Johnson. Although its publication was met with pretty much deafening silence, it did catch the eye of a friend of mine, a freelance editor who fresh on the heels of success with Gaël Faye’s <em>Small Country</em> was looking for new projects. Her name is Catherine Nabokov. She asked if I had something else in the works. I told her I had. I pitched it to her and she liked it. I was stoked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Winter was approaching, and we had fewer clients at Big Bus Tours, so I began bringing my computer and working on my novel on the bus as the blurred and scrambled city skidded by my window, icy winds rocketing up and down the stairs. I huddled in layers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Catherine’s aged parents lived on the tip of the Île de la Cité, in a 17th-century apartment building with a balcony I saw thrice daily on my Big Bus trips over the Pont-Neuf (<em>which is not, as some might think, bridge number nine</em>, <em>hahaha</em>, quoth 5-Star-Phil, ever the jokester). Catherine’s mother had grown up there. The building had been in the family since the 18th century. Abraham Breguet, watchmaker to the king, inventor of the automatic winding mechanism and ancestor of Catherine’s, had lived and worked there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though American, Catherine’s father, Ivan, was, in the 1980s and ‘90s, a famous foreign-language editor in France, where he published Stephen King, Mary Higgins Clark, Nadine Gordimer, Salman Rushdie, Toni Morrison, Donna Tartt, V. S. Naipaul, and William Gaddis—among many others. In all, eight Nobel Prize winners passed through his hands. He was also known in the business as a charming man with poor eyesight who made light of his handicap and was always cracking jokes, and always kind and witty and wise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One day Catherine told me that Les Escales (a Parisian publishing house) was looking for someone to pen her father’s memoirs in French. The search was not going well. Ivan was finicky. Would I like to meet him and discuss the book with him?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was now working part-time at Big Bus Tours, and doing simultaneous translation work for marketing research companies, and working on my novel (and doing lame James Brown imitations in the kitchen). Needless to say, the idea of penning a Nabokovian memoir was appealing, and I agreed to meet with Ivan. Meanwhile, from my perch on the bus, after passing by the building where Ivan lives, I would tell my joke to the tourists about the seagull perched upon the head of the equestrian statue of Henri IV in the middle of the Pont-Neuf:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>I’ve noticed it’s always the same seagull; sometimes you can see him chase the other birds away so he can keep his spot… And so, after much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is a bird that wants to get </em>a head<em> in life!</em></p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>As I was leaving I walked to the balcony, looked out at the Pont-Neuf and saw a Big Bus crossing the bridge. And I wasn’t on it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The</strong> day<strong> </strong>I met Ivan I was calm, since no matter what happened, at least I would have visited a publishing legend in a fabled building in a fabled part of my fabled city, and that was something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vladimir Nabokov’s writing bowled me over as a young man, and Ivan’s father Nicolas was his cousin. That was all I knew about him. So before going to meet Ivan, I went online. It turned out Nicolas was a talented composer and inveterate quadrilingual charmer five times married; and most famously, director in the 1950s and ‘60s of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, or CCF, which it was later revealed had been secretly funded by the CIA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, as I sat before Ivan in his high-ceilinged office, with paintings by Jacques-Émile Blanche and a wall of books I attempted not to ogle (not that he would have noticed, being almost completely blind), it was clear he had decided I was not up to snuff. He had just spent over an hour talking at me, bouncing off his own riffs (<em>when I worked for Louis-Dreyfus in the barter trade</em>&nbsp; <em>Bill Klein and I went bowling in Brooklyn once</em>…), digressing and digressing and barely responding to my attempts at conversation. Things were going so badly I smiled, amused by my own credulity: how could I have thought for one instant that an old man as grand as Ivan Nabokov would choose me to write his memoirs?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Ivan is 88, and though his memory is staggering, he does forget the odd name. He was presently grasping for a pianist; around his age, Ivan said, wonderful in Schubert, Beethoven, Mozart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alfred Brendel, I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Yes</em>. Alfred Brendel. Which is interesting, Ivan went on, because there are three pianists, born eleven years apart — all major pianists who all three share the same birthday: January 20. And Alfred Brendel, Ivan told me, is in the middle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alfred Brendel, I knew, was born in 1931.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1920, I said. Arturo Benedetti-Michelangeli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Yes</em>, said Ivan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, eleven years in the other direction. 1942. Maurizio Pollini, I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Yes!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Something happened, and three hours later I was still there, sipping bourbon with him and with Claude, his wife; I even stayed for dinner. As I was leaving I walked to the balcony, looked out at the Pont-Neuf and saw a Big Bus crossing the bridge. And I wasn’t on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Before</strong> long<strong> </strong>I had a contract, and a book to write, and a budding friendship, and in the coming months I got to know Ivan Nabokov as well as I have ever known anyone. I found, read and transcribed hundreds of letters spanning seven decades; interviewed dozens of people in person and on the phone; traveled to Caen to explore the archives of the IMEC… Ivan told me about being raised poor in a rent-controlled apartment on New York City’s Upper East Side by a Russian princess mother who worked as a saleslady for milliners and fashion designers; and how Ivan disappointed her by not learning Russian, and later by renouncing the faith (his mother was a devoutly Orthodox Christian)… seeing <em>Citizen Kane</em> at MoMA in the forties… and Moondog performing on 6th Avenue in Viking attire… and taking the subway by his lonesome all over New York in the ‘40s, going to the Staten Island Zoo, the Bronx Zoo, the Horn &amp; Hardart Automat, the Laff Movie Theatre on 42nd Street… and hanging out with Vladimir, Véra and Dmitri… and Edmund Wilson… and going to Harvard where he won the Bowdoin Prize and was Harry Levin’s graduate assistant, correcting John Updike’s essays on Shakespeare…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>…The premieres of Balanchine ballets were a regular treat throughout Ivan’s childhood and adolescence. In 1948, <em>Orpheus</em> made an especially vivid impression, with sparse music by Stravinsky (both Balanchine and Stravinsky were family friends) and hypnotic sets by Noguchi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterwards there was a party, and one of the dancers, eyeing the 16-year-old Ivan, asked his mother:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is he gay?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ivan’s mother was quick to reply:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh yes, absolutely! That boy doesn’t have a serious bone in his body!</p>

<p><strong>After</strong> having seen Ivan become furious (and he is nothing if not good-natured) at the characterization of his father in a book as a good-time Johnny who didn’t give a shit about art and music and had used the CCF and its CIA funding (which Nicolas subsequently professed to have been ignorant of) for the most egregious reasons, I was relieved, one day, to hear him say:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think he knew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few weeks later, when I arrived at Ivan’s he told me he had found a title for our book:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Nov Shmoz Ka Pop</em>, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ivan is a repository of jingles and couplets and rhymes and bits of aural or visual flotsam from the past, and Nov Shmoz Ka Pop came from a recurring character in Gene Ahern’s <em>Our Boarding House</em>, a comic strip from the 1920s and ‘30s in which a battered-looking bearded dude attempts over and over to hitch a ride by sticking his thumb out and uttering that nonsensical phrase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ivan was delighted with the title, which appeals to his love of the absurd.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you think our publisher will go for it? he wondered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In France, Zadie Smith’s <em>White Teeth</em> was called <em>Sourires de loup</em> (Smiles of a Wolf, or Wolf Smiles. Wolves are nowhere mentioned in the book, whereas the words <em>white teeth</em> are a racist trope at the heart of the story); and Louis Begley’s stunning <em>Wartime Lies</em>, about a Jewish boy hiding with his aunt in plain sight in Poland during the war using counterfeit identity papers (the lies in the title referring to the aliases the protagonists are forced to use to stay alive) was called <em>Une éducation polonaise</em> (A Polish Education).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So why not?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no. The memoirs of Ivan Nabokov, <em>La vie, les gens &amp; autres effets secondaires</em> (Life, People &amp; Other Side Effects), was published here on January 7th by Les Escales, and I look forward to telling you more about it later.</p>

<p><strong>“You really think </strong>you’re gonna replace me with one of those goddamn things?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abe just smiled. Smug bastard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve worked this gig thirty years, and I know for a fact that only a handful of people left in Hollywood can run the projector. And half of them were fired from here already; I remember one guy was so perpetually stoned he burned a hole through an archival print of <em>Ben-Hur</em>. I don’t know about the rest, but over the years they were all let go. Probably asked for raises or benefits or days off or something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now they want to replace me. The last projectionist in the building. I guess we’re all let go eventually. Cost of living versus cost of doing business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not like I’m much of an expense. The Cinerama Dome only runs so many print shows. Maybe fifteen screenings a month. On a good month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m only here because I can keep the Kinoton running for less than a contractor. That old mechanical monster’s a master class in jury-rigging. But both of us are one breakdown from the scrapheap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And all this right before October, when we roll out the reels for the Dome’s retro horror festival. <em>Horrorama:</em> <em>Blood, Sweat, and Film</em>. All analog, all month. Always brings in good crowds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I make most of my money for the year in October.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now they’re trying to pawn it off to a goddamn drone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abe<strong> </strong>snaked his way through a crack in the projection booth’s door. I could smell the greasy little puke’s cologne over the must and decades of bad paint jobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ahem—Crane.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I glanced over, saw the ankles of that stupid blue and red jumpsuit the admins wear, then those ten-grand specs perched on his glossy regen’d face. Privileged dork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah, what?” Hunched over, chin tucked into my coveralls, stubble poking my chest as I tested the intermittent sprocket wheel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn thing keeps nicking perfs. And those archivist hoarders we rent the prints from check every square micron of film when it goes back. Been having a problem with the automatic stop too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought you’d like to meet your new protégé.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My ears flushed, red-hot. Funny how you never notice your ears until moments like these. I straightened out, pushing off my creaking knees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abe had the door propped with one sickly white, baby smooth hand. He waved the thing in with the other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Come on, don’t be shy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And instead of what I’d been expecting—a steel stick figure with articulators where its hands should be—in walked a pockmarked kid with tousled, dirty blonde hair. Short. Maybe five six. Couldn’t be a day over sixteen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid shuffled in next to Abe, arms glued to his sides. He fiddled with the belt loops on his oversized uniform, green eyes looking nervous as can be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Crane, meet Andy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn’t believe how real the kid looked. Hard not to call it a kid. It was the first time I’d seen a realistic one up close. They only came back into production recently, after the troubles with those early models.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it wasn’t just the cosmetics of the thing. It looked uncomfortable. Unsure of itself. Intimidated, even. It fidgeted, rolling a thumb over its fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of that, programmed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why bother programming a sixteen-year-old virgin from the turn of the century?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So...”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Glassy, blinking eyes looked up at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You ever worked on one of these things before?” I cocked my head back to the Kinoton. The lamp was off. Fans hummed within the console.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid’s eyes darted to the projector’s housing, looking at the flat metal siding like it might attack him. He shook his head, the rest of his body frozen stiff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its head. Its body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It shook its head again, lips clamped, struggling with fake nerves. Then finally:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...No.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not what I expected when they told me I’d be getting a drone “assistant.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How are you supposed to run the projector then?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well...” Voice cracking the way the teenager’s it was modeled on would. “You’re supposed to teach me, I think.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Great. It’s a smartass too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Got it. Guessing you’re programmed to be a fast learner?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The information is in here.” It tapped the side of its head. “It just needs to be activated.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It found something invisible to inspect between its shoes. More fidgeting. Criminy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Why don’t you just know it all out of the box?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It winced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...Or whatever it is you came out of.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It looked up to me, eyes watery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For authenticity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The<strong> </strong>cafeteria machines were down at the open-air place off Selma. A few raggedy members of the voucher crowd stood under the franchise holos, still lit-up, staring at server avatars stuck in idle animations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My stomach grumbled. Then I did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I checked my watch. Twenty-two minutes left in my break. No messages. Ninety-nine degrees. Blood pressure above normal. An ad for the orange soap I use projected itself over the display.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why do marketing algorithms always try to sell me things I already have subscriptions for?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe they know I’ve been thinking about cancelling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I can’t afford the ad-free model. Not on my erratic hourly. I checked again, compulsively, tail end of the tangerine advertisement fading away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twenty-one minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Officially, Cinerama gives hourlies flexible breaks. But the tracking system reports anything over thirty minutes to Abe. Software snitch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went up Cahuenga, passing the tourists, the locals, the celebrities I wouldn’t recognize, the typical Hollywood freakshows. All of them staring off at nothing, some looking borderline catatonic, others muttering to people who weren’t there, or to computers pretending to be people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A group of fifty-odd cyclists circled in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard. A few had holos set up on their bikes, casting things like “GREEN MEANIES” and “GRANDFATHERS MUST DIE”, images of smashed-up lowriders rotating below the text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I smoothed my mustache. Almost completely grey now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A legacy-permitted Jeep sat on the other side of Cahuenga, honking away. The blast of its horn mixed with the music pumping from the protestor’s bikes. A couple confused AZ delivery units tried to enter the intersection, only to stutter and reverse. A refrigerated truck train idled nearby, apparently programmed with more patience than the AZ units. And the guy driving the Jeep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I moved on, heading for the closet-sized Cactus Taqueria outpost on the Boulevard. I’d asked the kid if it wanted anything, but it said it didn’t eat. Fine by me, only then wondering if it could pay me back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Were they paying him?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is he an employee, or property? He, or it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I guess that’s the measure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What the kid said had been bothering me. The authenticity thing. It just struck me how well it fits with the racks of old prints, the outdated machines I keep updating with new parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a full-blown authenticity fetish these days. That’s what the festival’s all about: letting people pretend they’re in an old grindhouse theater, reliving a time no one’s around to remember. That’s why the kid—the android—is the way it is. Designed for nostalgia. One hundred percent artificial authenticity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it doesn’t seem happy about it. Or is that just the teenage programming?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approaching Cactus, the smell of hot grease seeped from the barely washed griddle inside. A holo of my normal order came up on the window’s plastic screen. Burrito California con carnitas. Or whatever they’re selling as pork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah.” I nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cooks got to work. More authenticity: Cactus still uses people. They claim the machines don’t know how to wrap a burrito. I figure it’s a gimmick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A couple minutes later a wrapper slapped down on the service counter. Black sharpie scribbles: CAR BUR. I grabbed it and headed for the Dome, still mulling what the kid said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alright, what are these?” I pointed to the big, flat, aluminum discs next to the console.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Platters.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a fast learner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reel cases, flats, and cans sat stacked on the table behind the platters. Dummy prints. In this case, <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em>. A horror in its own right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So what we need to do is splice all seven reels, beginning to end, then mount that mega-reel on the input platter.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid nodded as I walked through the motions, film spooling from one winder to the next, rhythmically interrupted by the metallic punch of the splicer. Then we switched, and I watched it do the next reel in less time than I could, catching a split perf I probably would have missed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A very fast learner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe I am outdated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After we’d mounted the full picture reel, I removed the ring and pointed to the center of the platter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Now, you take the dummy leader,” I flicked the clear, loose strip, “and loop it through this thing right here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It moved closer, inspecting the series of rollers all those concentric rings of film led to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is the brain.” I grabbed the leader and wove it through the rollers. “Helps control tension, and feeds film throughout the movie. Watch.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pulled the rest of the leader to the projector, then through to the takeup ring, leaving a lot of slack.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Is there a chip that manages the brain?” It hovered over the input platter, still staring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No. It’s just rollers and axles. Manages itself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Doesn’t seem very smart for something called a ‘brain.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah? Well not everyone’s as smart as you, kid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It smiled. Didn’t mean it as a compliment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tucked the clear strip into the takeup ring and returned to the projector. Flush with the aperture, the worn metal gate stood propped, ready to be threaded. I glanced back to the kid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You wanna try this time?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You wanna try this time?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It. It nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stepped aside as it pulled an apple box over, watching it guide the leader through rollers and sprocket wheels and tension levers, eyebrows scrunched in concentration. The movements were smooth. Like it had been doing this for years. Like I was watching my own hands fix the loops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought back to my first time. The sweaty palms. The old man smelling of cigarettes and mold looming over me, barking every time I messed up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the kid snapped the pressure plate into place, smiling at its heavy mechanical click. It adjusted the lenses and punched the film advance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perfect. Like it was made for this. But I couldn’t say that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Not so fast, kid.” I killed the lamp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The smile faded from its face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Did I miss something?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christ. Kid’s way too eager to please.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes. I mean, no, that was good, but you were rubbing your fingers over the frames.” Had to find something. “Not a big deal with the leader, but if you have to fix something on the fly, you could scratch the image, or get your greasy little fingerprints all over it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well, I—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Same for the lamp. If you get any oil on the glass, you could shorten its lifespan. They burn out eventually, but you don’t want that to happen any more than necessary, because they’re expensive as hell, and the only place that still makes them is this machine shop in Bavaria.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was rambling. I took my cheaters off and kneaded the bridge of my nose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What were you saying?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Just that,” he held out his hand, “my skin doesn’t produce oil. And I don’t leave fingerprints.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stared at the smooth, rosy palms. The featureless fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oh. Well—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A knock at the door interrupted us. Abe poked his baby-skin face into the booth, big fake teeth looking like they might blind someone in direct sunlight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How’s everything going in here?” Followed by a manager’s smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to kick the door closed on his neck, sure he was getting his rocks off watching me train my replacement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Fine. You need something?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid went back in his shell, arms at his sides, examining his feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes. Andy?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could have sworn the kid flinched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Could you come down to my office? I’ll let you two finish up whatever you’re going over.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He slithered back out the door. Kid looked like he was about to piss himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Don’t worry, kid. He’s like that with everybody.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Bangladeshis were making a racket again. Second night in a row of drumming and quarter tonal singing. They milled about between the market stalls set up in the school’s landing. Their sequined saris (and whatever you call the things the men wear) glittered under the floodlights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This part of town was called Little Armenia when I was kid. But it wasn’t, really. Glendale was. Now it’s Little Dhaka, full of families escaping the slow flood, celebrating some festival that meant nothing to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company that owns this building replaced the windows a couple years ago. Said they were soundproofing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Doesn’t sound like it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I forced myself to stop staring. A cast played up on my wall, something recommended after <em>The Ohio Valley Film Review</em>. Teenagers screwing around with a quad in a dry cornfield. Mindless programming. One of them had wispy blonde hair. Deep dimples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reminded me of the kid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I turned it off, staring at my blank white wall, listening to the muted festivities outside. I took a puff off my Ember, yawned, and crumpled up the wrapper from my leftovers. My upstairs neighbor stomped around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I sighed. Too old for this one-bed. I walked to the kitchen, threw the wrapper in the brown compression can, and told the lights to turn off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got into work early, enjoying the morning silence in the cavernous entrance hall. None of the one-sheets had been turned on yet, leaving everything silver, white, and polished wood veneer. An LED marquee used to hang in the middle of the atrium, back before a Chinese company bought Arclight and upgraded everything to holos. Half the building’s screens got converted to experia pits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company changed hands a couple more times, eventually becoming American again. Whatever that means.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hazy eastern light played over the Dome’s off-white geodesics as I walked through the courtyard. Fake blood spatter had been put up overnight. When the holos turned on there would be ghosts floating around, appearing and disappearing, lurking shadows always just out of view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entry doors recognized me and wheezed open. Some of the limited-edition programs had been dropped off, sitting there in a pile near the concession stand. I scooped one up, bending its satin binding, watching the lobby’s dimmed lights slide over the cover art. Kaiju-sized Jason’s duked it out, stomping their way through the Hills. The Dome and a few other buildings poked up at odd angles down on Sunset.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Might be able to get something for this on SellBy. Or it could become another piece of memorabilia cluttering my apartment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wandered the interior loop, flipping through the silky, weighted pages. The bill read like a family tree of horror.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were the progenitors: <em>Nosferatu, The Man Who Laughs, Mystery of the Wax Museum; </em>a Universal Monsters night with <em>Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon</em>; up through the last-century devil spawn of <em>The Omen </em>and<em> Rosemary’s Baby</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pretty typical. But from there, the list got creative:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They had a weekend of two-for-one holiday movies with <em>Black Christmas, Gremlins</em>, <em>Easter Mass, My Bloody Valentine, Winter Break,</em> and a special combined director’s cut of <em>Thanksgiving</em> and <em>Black Friday</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mondays were “Hell” Night: <em>Drag Me to Hell,</em> <em>Hellraiser </em>numbers one through whatever<em>, The Legend of Hell House, HELLen Keller: Resurrection, </em>and, of course, <em>West Hellywood </em>(with a sing-along at the end).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I skimmed the subgenres. Sci-fi horror warped by with<em> Alien, Beta Test, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Phantom Station, Re-Animator, Orbital Decay, The Blob, The Faculty, The Rift,</em> and <em>The Thing.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hit October 18<sup>th</sup>. <em>Proxima Rising</em>—smack in the middle of sci-fi week. Smiling, I closed the program, curling it in one hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes management lets me suggest things. Usually it’s in one ear, out the other. But I managed to get something on the bill this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll keep telling myself that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I entered the stairwell, heading for the booth. The carpet had regrown some of its pile overnight, and the synthesized citrus smell of whatever disinfectant the cleaner mites use filled the stale air. I gazed at the familiar wall scratches, the divots from dropped boxes, then tucked the program under my shoulder and opened the sticker-plastered door at the top of the stairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I dropped the hard copy on a pile of film canisters, thinking of coffee, then yelped as I realized I wasn’t the only person in the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid stood next to the projector, eyes blank, facing the back wall. Then he blinked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Good morning.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Good morning? You scared the shit out of me kid. Why are you here so early?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It dawned on me before he answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...I have nowhere else to go.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought of my crappy little apartment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So you’ve been standing here all night with the lights off?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re supposed to reduce energy use in off-hours.” Like he had the handbook pulled up somewhere in his brain. Or whatever he uses to think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Does management know about this?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That may have been the first time those words ever came out of my mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think so.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seemed embarrassed. I ran my fingers through my hair, trying to think of something to say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This felt wrong. Standing here all night, alone in a dark room. At least I had the Bangladeshis. I pulled a chair from the back table and sat down, pointing to another by the platters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sit down, kid.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He did. Neither of us said anything for a moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Can I ask you something?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Are you OK with that?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought he broke for a second. He stared ahead like I hadn’t said anything, gazing somewhere about a mile behind my eyes. Then he shrugged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if he’d want to stay with me. Then I thought of HR. Didn’t want to deal with them again. But would they even cover him?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently not, based on everything I was hearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This might be a dumb question, but... You’re not getting paid, are you?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He shook his head, but then seemed to think better of it. “Well, technically I’m a lease.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remembered storming out of Abe’s office, anger boiling over at the faceless machine they wanted to replace me with, sweat pooling under my arms. I had an image in my mind: a metallic drone, with actuators instead of arms and hands and legs, sensors instead of eyes and ears and soft skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would I care if they paid the thing I’d first imagined? Regardless of how smart it was? How it might have felt?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can he feel?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He seems like he can. Or is that the programming?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to collect my thoughts, struggling with my preconceptions. My own programming. This kid had been my personal bogeyman for weeks. Now I had to sit here and see him for what he was: property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My watch buzzed. Time to clock in.</p>

<p>September 30<sup>th</sup>. Final prep for <em>Horrorama </em>was in full swing. The festival kicks off tonight, with a dusk-till-dawn marathon of <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people just can’t get enough scary doll movies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had the program spread on the back table, going over it as the kid inspected some anamorphic lenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a good year: ended up with five weekends this October. <em>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></em> quadruple features run every Friday of the month. Plenty of cosplay nights as well. Not that people need an excuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hollywood was made for Halloween.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A litany of living deads roamed the schedule: <em>Night of the Living Dead, Brunch of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead</em>; alongside the regular old deads: <em>Day of the Dead, Dusk of the Dead, Evil Dead, Dead Headings, Braindead</em>; the debatable inclusion of <em>28 Days / Weeks / Months Later</em>; and a splattering of cult classics like<em> CHUD</em> and<em> Beneath Hackney Wick.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I noticed the kid had moved from inspecting the lenses to inspecting me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You read the program?” I asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...It’s decent.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What, you think you could do better?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...Yes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bold, kid. Not that I hadn’t thought the same thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yeah? You don’t like what they picked for Stephen King Day or something?” I chuckled to myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a day dedicated to King adaptations every year. This time around it was<em> Children of the Corn, Cujo, From a Buick 8, The Shining, </em>the good version of <em>Pet Sematary</em>, and <em>Rage</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid took the bait:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If they’re scheduling <em>The Shining</em>, they should have <em>Doctor Sleep</em> too.” He stuck his hands in his pockets, scuffed the linoleum with one of his shoes. “And <em>Children of the Corn</em> is just plain bad.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wow. Kid had something to say. And maybe he had a point, but:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sometimes bad is good with horror movies, kid. People like to laugh at scary things.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I guess. I also think they should’ve included <em>Bedbugs</em> on creature feature night. And not scheduling <em>April Fool’s Day</em> on holiday weekend seems like an oversight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Whoa whoa whoa—what do you know about any of these movies? Half of them came out before you were bor—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His doe eyes stopped me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...Not really sure what your preference is with that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He chewed his lip, looking at the wall behind me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Made, I guess.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Really? Why?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Well,” still chewing his lip, “I wasn’t born. I didn’t grow up. I have memories of being younger; period-accurate memories for the archetype I’m designed to emulate... Most are about watching movies.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He hung his head, toying with the seams on his uniform.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But I know they’re not real. They’re not mine. I was just made to be like this.” He gestured to his body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Never thought I’d feel bad for the drone stealing my job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If it makes you feel any better, there’s a whole bunch of shit I don’t remember from when I was younger than you... look.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He sat silent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So when were you... How long have you been—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Two weeks. Since orientation anyway. That’s the first new thing I remember.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Orientation to what?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Human interaction.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I kept asking questions I didn’t want answers to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hit my OT ceiling with the kid that night, pre-building the <em>Friday</em> picture reels. Between the two of us, it didn’t take long. And after midnight there wasn’t much to do but wait for the <em>Annabelle </em>marathon to let out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We sat in front of the focus window, watching the crowd of possessed doll aficionados dwindle<em>.</em> Andy was smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You actually like this stuff, don’t you kid?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nodded, beaming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow that made me feel even worse. Kid’s practically a slave, but can’t help enjoying himself. Is that his programming, or genuine interest?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is there any way to tell?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I patted down my coveralls, searching for my Ember. If I was going to be sitting here unpaid, might as well unwind a little bit. Pulling the thin black cylinder out, I held it up in the reflected light from the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took a puff, vapor clouding my view as it dispersed into the filtered air of the booth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You want some?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked at me like I was already stoned—which I just about was—and shook his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It wouldn’t do anything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should’ve known. Designed as a worker bee. Why would they let him get high? The tension left my shoulders, and what I’d been trying to come to terms with floated to the surface of my mind:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid isn’t the problem. The people who made him are.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The projector purred, and we watched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This movie sucks.” He said, after a few minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I laughed, and coughed, and laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>October 1<sup>st</sup>. The first full horrorshow day. And the first <em>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup></em> marathon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s been smooth sailing, thanks to the kid. We made it through <em>Starry Eyes</em>, <em>The House on Sorority Row</em>, <em>Piranha: Deep Space</em>, and <em>The Devil’s Vineyard </em>without any issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now the original <em>Friday </em>is winding through the Kinoton. It’s a newly “un-restored” print, with over-saturated colors, fake scratches, and reel change cues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost to the jump scare on the lake. I double-check our prep; <em>Part II</em> and <em>Part III</em> are already on platters, with the poorly named <em>Part IV: The Final Chapter</em> ready to be mounted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andy looks giddy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How you feeling, kid?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His smirk droops, but only slightly. Like he doesn’t want me to know how much he’s enjoying this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Good.” He glances away from the window. “Good.” Nodding, as if he’s reassuring himself it’s true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My stomach growls. I check my watch. An advertisement for Ghost Specs—smoke swirling around frames made of darker smoke—fades to the time: 21:12. No messages. Eighty degrees. Blood pressure normal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dinnertime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Think you can handle the changeover?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His mouth hangs open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sure. Yeah.” Pride creeps onto his pockmarked face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The still water of Camp Crystal Lake shines in the theater, hundred-year-old morning sunlight bouncing off the geometric curves of the ceiling. I point to the screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You seen this one before?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He nods and turns back to the flickering image, but still jumps as Jason’s waterlogged, undead corpse breaches the surface of the lake. I laugh, and he keeps smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alright, I’m gonna get some food. You got this.” I pat him on the shoulder, immediately regretting it. Too fatherly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pass Abe as I’m exiting the building. He’s here late.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Another break?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Need some food. Kid’s got it under control.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Still calling him kid? You know it’s a machine, right?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d like to knock his teeth out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The<strong> </strong>cafeteria on Selma is open today. I stop by the poutine kiosk, joining a scattered group of other late-working Hollywood functionaries. The avatars sit idle, looking as bored as the people waiting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I order two smalls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why not let the kid give it a shot? Doubt he’s got poutine in one of those designer memories of his. If he doesn’t want it, I’ll eat it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A minute later two sealed cardstock cubes slide onto the service counter, my name flash burned on top. Cradling them in my arm, I head for Sunset, and the Dome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re<strong> </strong>well into <em>Part II</em> when I get back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The console hums, rapid <em>click click click click click </em>filling the booth as the film moves through the gate. The screen’s reflection lights up the projector window. Squeals and laughter erupt as a machete buries itself in someone’s face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can practically smell the corn syrup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t see the kid. He should be watching the slack loops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A moan cuts through the normal racket of the booth, coming from the other side of the projector. The work light casts a pale tungsten glow over the assembled reel as it turns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming around the console, I see Abe. He’s facing the corner, left hand pushed against the wall like he’s drunk at a urinal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He shouldn’t be in here. He’s never in the booth during a show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As my eyes adjust, I see his hips moving back and forth, other arm by his side, hand clenched about waist level. Tufts of dirty blonde hair stick through his fingers, barely visible in the half-light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I hear the choked sobbing. The gagging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I drop the food. The hair on my arms stiffens into quills as I lope around the platters and grab the back of Abe’s neck, slamming his face into the wall, ears ringing. The kid slumps into the corner, covering his tear-streaked face. Abe’s arms flail, hands clutching for what’s left of my hair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I swat his grabbing hands away and smash him against the wall again. And again. When his arms go slack I throw him to the floor. His head catches the corner of the projector with a hollow thud, and the film dances loose. I hear shouts from the audience as the image judders and blurs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goddammit. Knocked it off perf.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Autopilot: I run to the other side of the console as a ribbon of celluloid comes loose, killing the advance. The audience goes off, screaming at the projection booth, picture still-framed on a fade to white. I reach for the errant coil of film, blood slick over my fingers. It drips on the reel as I tuck the film back into its loop. A crimson bead makes its way down the base side, sizzling as it touches the gate. The trail of blood enters the live frame, baking under the heat of the lamp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The audience explodes in a raucous cheer. I punch the advance just as I get the first whiffs of burning celluloid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The film rolls on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blood<strong> </strong>pools on the floor under Abe’s head, almost black in the darkness of the booth. Weak pulse. Shallow breathing. Can’t tell how deep the cut is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I need to get him help, or I’ll be in even deeper shit than I already am.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I shuffle over to Andy. He’s still in the corner, staring straight ahead. The tears on his cheeks catch the work lamp’s dim amber light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looks more human than ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You OK?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A teardrop leaks from the corner of his eye, rolls down to his chin. He nods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hold out my hand. Most of the blood has dried. A lot of it was mine. Abe managed to scratch me as I was bashing his face against the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kid stares past it, not looking at anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Come on, kid. Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a jagged sniffle, he reaches out. His skin feels smooth and warm, like a child’s. He looks at me, and I notice how bloodshot his eyes are. How his eyelids are all puffed up. The way he blinks the tears away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Someone wrote code for this. Developed software to emulate suffering. Someone got paid to make his pain authentic. His features, his behaviors—they’re indistinguishable from any other teen’s. You’d never know the difference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I usher him to the door, and we descend to the lobby. A couple guys walking out of the bathroom give us some weird looks, then avert their eyes and continue to the theater. I pull up emergency services on my watch, swiping to an ambulance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We walk out to Sunset, my hand on his shoulder, into the warm evening of LA’s never-ending summer. A two-story holo of a blood-splattered hockey mask rotates above us, the shimmering light field of blades above that. I hear the sirens, then spot the flashing red and blue of an ambulance curving down through the night sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crouching to the kid’s level, I open my mouth, searching for something to say. Something that would help, would make some part of this alright. But nothing comes. What would?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Kid—Andy—I’m so—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He interrupts me, whispering:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...For what?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For treating me like a real person.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another tear rolls down his face.</p>

52,"Furniture As Comrade: Enzo Mari’s Autoprogettazione","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">In our Reappraisals series, we will undertake to reconsider writers and artists whose reputations have undeservedly faded, never flourished in the first place, or sagged under the weight of undue attention. Last October, Enzo Mari, prolific Italian modernist designer, was given a major retrospective at the Triennale Milano Museum in Italy. He died two days later. Endlessly versatile and deeply influential, Mari, the acerbic, outspoken, lifelong communist devoted his career to infusing the everyday with poetic simplicity.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“How can one </strong>change the state of things?” This simple yet weighty question sums up the lifelong mission of the late Italian designer, Enzo Mari, whose sixty-year-long career was devoted to the investigation of design practice as a means to achieve societal transformation. Firmly critical of an increasingly consumerist and hyper-commodified culture, Mari always believed that the political task of the designer—far from being limited to the creation of new objects for the market—is to imagine radically alternative ways of living and producing to those prevailing under contemporary capitalism. Ones in which the basic needs of humanity would take first place and new, sustainable modes of engagement with our material world would become possible. An ambitious pursuit that resonates with the utopian ideals of the early Constructivist avant-garde, and that finds renewed urgency at a moment when society—in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic—is coming to terms with the ills of a global economic order built on vicious cycles of accumulation and waste, profit-driven agendas, labor exploitation, environmental destruction, and outrageous levels of inequality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ethical conception of design as a vehicle for change permeates one of Mari’s best known projects, <em>Autoprogettazione</em> (which can be loosely translated as “Self-design”), first presented in 1974 in the form of an exhibition at Galleria Milano in Milan. <em>Autoprogettazione</em> consisted of a participatory exercise that saw Mari hand out a manual containing the detailed blueprints for several items of furniture—chairs, beds, tables, a wardrobe, a bench, and a bookcase—to anyone who requested one. Later, Mari would make the manual available by mail order for the cost of postage alone. A few wooden planks, a hammer, and some nails were all that was needed, thanks to the simplicity of Mari’s designs, which responded to strictly functional purposes such as solidity, practicality, easy repairability, and economy of means. The method of construction was based on the “archetypal and very simple technique” commonly used by joiners to build their work tools. This meant that only an elementary level of skill was required of the participants, and that the exercise was in principle open to everyone.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented""><em>Autoprogettazione</em> was conceived as a “practical-critical exercise” in raising awareness for the design process behind common consumer items. Each piece of furniture had an inherent ""structural reasoning” which, argued Mari, served to highlight functional attributes over the provocations of form. Particularly in the design capital of Milan, a true “cult of the object” had taken hold throughout Italy during the post-war economic boom which vaulted industrially produced household items to the status of quasi-art pieces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a reaction to the ubiquitous alluring commodity,<em> Autoprogettazione</em>’s items of furniture stood as the prototypes for a new kind of object: honest and transparent, rather than false and mystified. An object in which all superfluous additions have been left out and every detail announces its function, stands as proof of the sincerity of the project. Mari’s self-evident description of one of <em>Autoprogettazione</em>’s tables is telling in this sense: “This leg is a leg, this latticework underneath is a strengthening beam, the small struts under the boards of the tabletop are there to prevent it from vibrating, the nail serves to link the boards together.”</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mari’s</strong> choice to embed pedagogical clarity into the very structure of his furniture is a powerful antidote to the obscurity of contemporary production processes (and, by extension, their products), which are usually conceived in such a way that the technologies, skills, supply chains and forms of labor converging in the realisation of most everyday objects remain largely invisible to the final users. This built-in impenetrability is further compounded by the distractions of marketing typical of today’s attention economy. Even the adoption of an apparently innocuous format such as the how-to manual—a staple of DIY culture and amateur craft—becomes a tool of empowerment against a system designed to ensure, says Mari, that “the number of ignorant people be the largest possible.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than being subordinate to the finished product, then, the process of making becomes absolutely relevant to <em>Autoprogettazione</em>: it offers the participant the opportunity to practise a “hands-on” way of thinking based on close involvement with materiality, and ultimately, to reclaim some degree of autonomy over the surrounding environment. Rather than adopting an IKEA-like prescriptive approach to DIY, <em>Autoprogettazione</em> expressly encourages its participants to experiment freely with techniques and materials either by introducing formal variations to the designs or by realising different items altogether. Playful tinkering of this sort is the way in which human beings, since time immemorial, have developed what curator Glenn Adamson calls “material intelligence,” namely, the ability to understand deeply and give shape to the material world around us. A faculty which relies not so much on rational thought as on trial-and-error experimentation, resourcefulness, curiosity, intuition, and skill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The need to engage with our material reality is all the more pressing in the 21st century, due to capitalism’s relentless tendency towards de-skilling, hyper-specialization and mechanization. A process of abstraction further accelerated by the IT revolution, which has gradually eroded our ability to perform basic activities such as, says Mari, “evaluating, disassembling, reassembling, understanding, adapting, improving what we hold in the palm of a hand.” <em>Autoprogettazione</em>’s embrace of craftsmanship does not embody an all-out rejection of the tools of industry per se. Rather, it hints at a space of possibility within the current system where a “transformative,” unalienated model of production can be experienced and a durable relationship can form between the maker and the thing they made.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The deeper social message underpinning Mari’s project is the realization that the idea of well-being can be divorced from the capitalist myth of endless material expansion. It can be associated instead with the availability of fewer objects. Mari’s call for a simpler society, however, has nothing to do with the policies of austerity put forth by neoliberal agendas to justify the siphoning of vital resources away from the ninety-nine percent. Nor should it be read as a rejection of materialism altogether. Rather, Mari is inviting us to privilege objects that, like <em>Autoprogettazione</em>’s furniture, are not just “stupidly necessary” but embody “a model for a different society.” One where things are enjoyed as “convivial tools”—to borrow the expression coined by social theorist Ivan Illich in 1973. Objects, from this perspective, matter for their untapped ethical potential, and not just as inert entities to be possessed and quickly discarded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mari’s line of thought resonates strikingly with the radical theories of the early Constructivist avant-garde. As art historian Christina Kiaer argues, the idea of objects as catalysts for a better society was a constant theme among the Russian Constructivists. Much unlike the Western commodity fetish, the Constructivist object (exemplified, for Kiaer, by Tatlin’s stoves, pots and pans, Popova's and Stepanova's textile patterns and gender-defying clothes and Rodchenko’s design for the interior of his Worker’s Club) was assigned peculiar agency as a fellow “comrade” in the fight for a future socialist collective. Such an object did not only serve the needs of the community, but was considered a revolutionary in its own right: an “active and emotionally affective” participant of a composite assembly, where human beings and things alike enjoyed a new, shared subjectivity and interacted as equals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By broadening the horizon of objecthood to encompass interpersonal relations, the Constructivists implied that a reformed attitude toward the material world is key to living harmoniously with fellow human beings. Things, seen in this way, can enable human contact in much more immediate and intense ways than language could ever do. The collaborative exchanges brought into being by <em>Autoprogettazione</em> are proof of this. In devising his proposal, Mari sought to establish a non-hierarchical alliance between the designer—who gives away the instructions to anyone who wants to make use of them (with the notable exception of businesses that would exploit the designs for profit)—and the user, who responds by generously offering their time and skills and by sharing in turn the results of their work. This form of co-creation, based on the free sharing of knowledge, was aimed at generating a virtuous cycle of responsible habits which, like “a stubborn cobweb thread,” would bind more and more individuals together into a newly engaged collectivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Unsurprisingly</strong>, Mari’s ambitious proposition failed to make inroads into a society bewitched by consumerism, as was shown by the ambivalent initial response to <em>Autoprogettazione</em>, whose true spirit, complained Mari, had been fully grasped by only about one percent of the audience. As Mari recalled, most people who got in touch with him were either looking for cheap ways to furnish their rented flats or were merely interested in the aesthetics of the furniture. (Many commented enthusiastically on the “rustic” appeal of the pieces, which would perfectly suit their mountain cabins.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Mari’s empowering message is that the state of things is already changed at the very moment we start changing our collective mindsets and habits: “the better world” is not a distant “heaven on Earth” but is the “battle that is being fought.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">And yet, almost half a century later, and in the midst of a crisis which is shaking the foundations of consumer capitalism like never before, the consciousness-raising potential of <em>Autoprogettazione</em> seems more timely than ever. Consider the newfound popularity of progressive concepts once relegated to the fringes of cultural debates such as: degrowth, recession design, or circular economy. Similarly, the craft-based, open-source and cooperative approach to design which animates <em>Autoprogettazione</em> can be detected in today’s widespread resurgence of maker culture. Personal manufacturing is increasingly being turned into a tool of political resistance, aimed at creating alternative means of production with the aid of digital technologies such as 3D printing. During the pandemic, a significant number of avant-garde design practitioners and makers have self-produced protective equipment for their communities (such as masks, shields, or even ventilators) and eagerly shared their know-how online. This global effort shows that, consistent with Mari’s belief, genuine design is concerned with the “substance” of human problems, as opposed to mere appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ultimately,<em> Autoprogettazione </em>conveys utopia not as a vision of the future to be brought about by design (a goal that, for Mari, is unachievable and whose pursuit “generates death”) but as a novel way of doing things to be put in practice in the here and now. Utopia is not a place, says Mari, but an “ethical handrail” we can hold on to “in the labyrinth of contradictions and of compromises of this world.” “By making a chair” and using the “right nail” in doing so, for example, “you can communicate a set of values” to be realized in daily life, such as responsibility, awareness, care, agency, and manual skill. Mari’s empowering message is that the state of things is already changed at the very moment we start changing our collective mindsets and habits: “the better world” is not a distant “heaven on Earth” but is the “battle that is being fought.” Only in this way can the unfulfilled project of social transformation dreamed by the avant-gardes be turned into a practical program in the present. Now that the cracks in the empire’s wall are there for everyone to see, <em>Autoprogettazione</em> serves above all as a reminder that the task of remaking the world is within everyone’s ability and is more urgent than ever. It is up to us to start reaching for our toolboxes.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Unable to meet in person due to the pandemic travel bans, Zineb, in her South London Brixton studio, and I, in the wildfire-ridden Bay Area, engaged in a Covid-era virtual interview. We covered a range of topics including how Sedira defines imperialism, her upcoming work representing France at the Venice Biennale 2022, and her use of archival materials.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Zineb Sedira has been mining her personal relationship to post-colonialism and a transnational identity in her artistic practice for over 20 years. Sedira’s work in photography, video and installation continues to draw on the silenced cultural history of Algeria and her own autobiography to create work with expansive themes around memory, migration and the archive. Posing important questions on the relation between history and aesthetics, trauma and form, Sedira has established herself as a significant voice in the global contemporary artworld conversation.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born in Paris in 1963 to Algerian immigrant parents and raised in the <em>banlieues</em> of Paris, Zineb Sedira graduated from London’s Central Saint Martins and the Slade School of Art, where she was influenced by Stuart Hall’s British Cultural Studies and the Black Arts Movement. Her work has been shown in several solo exhibitions, most recently at the Jeu de Paume (Paris, 2019), the IVAM‑Institut Valencià d’Art Modern (Spain, 2019), the Beirut Art Center (Lebanon, 2018), and the Sharjah Art Foundation Art Spaces (UAE, 2018).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sedira is the founder of <em>aria</em>, an artist residency program in Algiers that supports the development of the contemporary art scene in Algeria through international cross-cultural exchanges and collaborations. Zineb Sedira will be the first artist of African descent to represent France at the 2022 Venice Biennale.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>NB</strong>: What does “After Empire” mean to you? How do such questions play out in your recent work on the Pan-African Festival in Algeria in 1969, <em>Standing Here Wondering Which Way to Go</em>, an installation first shown at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 2019 and commissioned by&nbsp;Jeu de Paume, Paris, France; IVAM, Valencia, Spain; Gulbenkian, Lisbon, Portugal; Bildmuseet, Umeå, Sweden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ZS</strong>: In the 1960s many African, Latin American, and Asian countries were becoming independent through diplomatic negotiations or wars. These countries had arrived at what I would call the “End of an Empire” era. At the height of these struggles, leaders of these countries joined forces under the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) created in 1961 in Belgrade. It was created to counteract capitalism and Western imperial powers. The movement fiercely opposed apartheid governments, supported diverse guerrilla movements, and stood up to imperialist wars around the globe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1969, the Pan African Festival of Algiers—mandated by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)—was organised (and largely financed) by the Algerian State. It was a celebration of the victory of the Algerian War of Independence, the armed struggle waged against French colonialism (1954 to 1962). The festival was an enactment of anti-imperial positions and showed the desire for Algeria to engage on a global scale economically and politically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is clear, however, that 60 years later these “after-imperialist” ideas failed, to a certain extent, as some African countries have had to rely on these major power blocs again, being re-colonized and economically dependent all over again. They have had to create economic dependency in order to survive thus entering into a new form of subordination and enslavement. So, I think my installation <em>Standing Here Wondering Which Way to Go</em> is pertinent as it reminds us of the 1960s political anti-imperialist consciousness and the complexity of inter-related cultural and global political trends. It also highlights the failures and fallibility of the politics of that time. The installation also extends to the different social movements that were developing in the ‘60s, the golden age of protest movements. This was a decade of dynamic social activism denouncing wars, bigotry, police brutality, poverty and hunger, women’s oppression and other inequalities...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After 1970, the memories of optimism and global solidarity faded away, leaving a sense of mourning for the passing of a once imagined bright future. As a result, the global demand for greater social justice and a redistribution of wealth still exists and is even more urgent today with world population growth and climate change.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How do you distinguish between anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism in your work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I agree with Edward Said’s statement: ""Imperialism involves the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominant metropolitan center ruling a distant territory, while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements on a distant territory.” So, I understand colonialism&nbsp;as the physical control of another country and imperialism&nbsp;as referring to&nbsp;the&nbsp;politics and economics of domination, and is often connected to the British Empire. As an artist of French Algerian background living in the United Kingdom, much of my work explores and exposes French colonialism and British imperialism together through both my own family’s history and my everyday life in London.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Do you feel that we are in a new countercultural moment globally with #MeToo #BlackLivesMatter and other contemporary socio-political movements?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do believe there is a kind of countercultural “moment” with #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. I am happy to see that people all across the world have taken a stand against police violence and racism. During the Covid-19 crisis, we also witnessed race and class inequalities as evidenced by the scale of the loss of life and the economic consequences, especially catastrophic for the working class. Since the killing of George Floyd in the US happened during the pandemic when almost everyone was at home, faced with the same fears and focussed on the media and screens, it generated favorable conditions for a political consciousness and a moment of global solidarity. Other political movements, such as Extinction Rebellion—a global environmental movement abbreviated as XR—have also created strong universal alliances. But the big question remains, will this countercultural moment be sustainable?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In your 2002 video <em>Mother Tongue</em> you explore three generations of your family——your mother, you and your daughter——each speaking in her own “mother tongue”——Arabic, French and English, respectively——to the others but unable to communicate directly. This video reveals a bond that goes beyond language and nationality and generations and is specific to diasporic identity. The fact that <em>Mother Tongue</em> has been shown around the world and continues to resonate deeply with audiences makes me think that this work points to a utopian desire in all of us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if everyone could understand each other through languages and shared knowledge of each other’s cultures, traditions and art… without having to negate or erase them or each other? Perhaps this is where racism, intolerance and discrimination could be overcome? I know it sounds naive but it is definitively my utopian view and my hope. And perhaps this romantic future rests with the diasporic communities?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">I share your utopian views. Speaking of hopes and wishes: you have been selected as the first artist of African descent to represent France at the 59th Venice Biennale in 2022. Your selection marks the fourth time that a woman would represent the nation, following Annette Messager (2005), Sophie Calle (2007), and Laure Prouvost (2019). Without revealing too much about your Pavilion’s theme and content, could you tell <em>Dispatches</em> about your initial response to being selected to represent France, the country of your family’s very personal colonial experience?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must say I was surprised by this selection, but I feel honored to represent France at the Venice Biennale 2022. It is a major shift for French contemporary art and France’s relationship to its complex history with Algeria. As an Arab-Berber-Algerian-French-woman based in London representing France, I interpret the choice by the French government as a political statement. It is a strong signal to change the international “image” of the French contemporary art scene as well as a form of “reconciliation” with the country’s now multi-generational immigrant community. It is, finally, an acknowledgment of France’s true diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what I was not prepared for was the level of discrimination and intimidation that occurred &nbsp; in response to my nomination. I was subject to defamatory accusations by a group of people that was hoping that the Ministries of Culture and Foreign Affairs would withdraw the nomination or that I might renounce representing France. Of course, this did not happen. As an Algerian-French woman and an artist, I have been given an opportunity, a platform, a voice to continue being critical of all forms of hatred and racism. So, despite this attempt to silence me and infringe on my freedom of expression, I will be representing France at the next Venice Biennale!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often this type of attempt to silence or negate—and this is not the first time my work has been censored—motivates one even more to fight back. As disturbing as it can be to experience such bigotry, it provokes me to continue to produce art and tells me somehow that the work I am doing is important and still valuable. So, when I started thinking of an art project for the French Pavilion in Venice, I was undeniably going to continue with the work recently explored: cultural and political solidarities within a post-colonial context most likely using archival materials such as film.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Bravo! So, the fight continues.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I do understand what Kobena Mercer calls the “burden of representation.” However, as my work is as personal as it is political, I do not feel I am or have to be an “authority” on the subjects that I explore. Identity is intersectional—politics, race, gender and class all play a part.&nbsp; There isn’t one way to represent one’s “diasporic” experience. It is obvious that the work I will make for the Venice Biennale will be connected with my favorite themes.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You are committed to resisting French amnesia and aphasia intrinsic to its colonialist past. So much of your work is about revealing the silent unspoken history of this violent past. Please give us an example of work that does this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of my works address French—and to a certain extent Algerian—historical amnesia and aphasia. In 2003 I created two video installations, <em>Mother Father and I</em> (2003) and <em>Retelling Histories: my mother told me…</em> (2003), where my parents recall their experience of the Algerian revolution fought against French colonialism. These two pieces tell the stories of my parents’ life in a rural area confronted by French army atrocities. It was the first time that my parents had spoken so extensively and openly about their colonial experiences as young adults.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am interested in listening to and transmitting stories by ordinary people and not the voices of political leaders or the ruling elite. For example, <em>Image Keepers</em> (2010) is a video installation that addresses issues of memory and history. The work values ​​individual memory as another way to access history via personal legacy and experiences as well as archives as sources to understand the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The work relates to the photographic collection of Mohamed Kouaci (1922-1996), photographer of the Algerian revolution and independent Algeria, now managed by his widow, Safia. These portraits and photographs are precious and invaluable documents that bear witness to the history of the Algerian war and post-independence by an Algerian citizen, rather than the “official” journalism and French army documentation. Here, the memory invoked is personal: we discover the photographer through family memories, anecdotes that speak of the man or husband as much as of the professional or the activist. The emphasis is on living memory, carried and transmitted by a witness who understands the link between past and present. The video installation becomes a space of commemoration, of re-memory.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So here, I am using oral history and a photographic archive to question amnesia and aphasia that often occur after a colonial period. I also ask myself: What role can the archive play in developing and sustaining a critical and culturally located art history that speaks not only to the past but to the present and the future? How does art negotiate the potential and the pitfalls of the archive as source material?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Yes, your use of archives seems to be more and more a central part of your practice. How do you, as you say,&nbsp;“negotiate the potential and the pitfalls of the archive as source material”? How do you use the archive for story-telling?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think about the problems of the archives as primary source material in many ways. I think we search for fragments of the past to understand the present. When we examine the present, we must understand our own past: the past that has informed our own personal present. That’s a philosophy of life that I live by and that is hopefully expressed in the work that I do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have been interrogating histories and archives—primarily those that have been hidden, destroyed, altered, or neglected—to create counter narratives from the official ones, whether French or Algerian. As an artist, when using conventional archives, I am often struggling not to fall into what I call the “fetishization or reverence” of the archive. I often use the aesthetics of decay and death to reflect on loss (as in the video <em>mise-en-scène</em>, 2019, or again in <em>Haunted House</em>, 2006, to name but two) and on the need to expand the past because we cannot expand the present.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have done research for many projects using conventional archival materials found in repositories such as museums, state and private archives as well as libraries. From this research, I then compile my own archive or collection, so to speak, of images, objects, music, film, photography, furniture, fine art (painting and sculpture) as well as literature and ephemera. I generate a new form or system of knowledge and information which I hope disrupts and replaces the conventional archive. I am proposing a generous and generative alternative access to historic documents and data that remain outside the mainstream libraries and museums.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the processes of photographing and “recording records” with my iPhone, the archive presents me with its own indelible vulnerability to reinterpretation, if not its own shortcomings as a document. The documents selected interrogate the impermanence of image archives and underscore the difficulty of preserving the analog in advance of digital solutions. This question of the relationship of the archive with technology today interests me greatly.&nbsp; How do we store and label archival data? Do we still restore and conserve the original documents? What do we lose in this digital transformation?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>By using discarded, damaged and neglected archival material I try to protect and transmit the fragments of a collective memory built on lacunae, traumas, secrets and the unspoken.

<p class=""interviewer"">Indeed. I was really struck by the beauty of the nine-minute film entitled, <em>mise-en-scène</em> 2019, which you made as part of your exhibition <em>A Brief Moment</em> at the Jeu de Paume last year. It opens with a text reading, “In June 2018, after a visit to the Cinémathèque of Algiers archive, I decided to browse in bric-à-brac shops… I discovered two canisters containing fragments of worn ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s films. The vendor told me the canisters came from a retired projectionist… so I pieced the footage together to create my own film.” This spliced together and colorfully tinted patchwork of images that range from abstract patterns to mundane scenes of Algerian life felt like a living archive. It got me thinking about the status of a national Algerian cinema archive or cinémathèque. This is a strong example of the political effect of your repurposing found archives—the questions that are engendered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, there are official film archives in Algeria. They can be found at the Cinémathèque of Algiers, the RTA (Radio and Television Broadcasting) or the CNCA (National Center for Cinematography and Audiovisual) to name a few. However, as much as the RTA and CNCA seem to have looked after their archives, the Cinémathèque of Algiers has been struggling due to the considerable volume of documents/archives followed by the advent of political turmoil such as the Berber Spring cultural uprising (1980), and the civil war referred to as the Black Decade (1990), when official interest in the film industry decreased significantly. The abandonment of cinema and its proper archiving impacted all of Algerian culture. And, since Algiers is situated by the sea, natural elements have severely eroded these precious films, photographs and other documents. Thankfully, over this last decade, the cultural ministry has prioritised restoration, especially of the 35mm and 16mm Algerian film stocks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having said this, the issue is still the lack of access to these materials for researchers, academics or artists like me. Also, the films that have been restored so far are not distributed by DVD or live stream, so they continue to remain inaccessible to the Algerian people who are denied the knowledge of their own film history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I found the canister with these damaged and discarded bits of film, I was very curious about the images I would find and I knew they would be very precious to me. In <em>mise-en-scène</em> 2019, I created a kind of collage of these fragments, a new form of re-appropriation of the archive creating a visual history. The audience is invited to imagine stories behind the frames, undertaking their own archaeological work that studies the fissures, scratches and erosion of the archives. I believe old photos or films offer glimpses into a past through printing errors, stamps, scratches or stains, hand written notes or marks, etc. These traces have directly affected the life of the documents and are important to me as they provide new stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By using discarded, damaged and neglected archival material I try to protect and transmit the fragments of a collective memory built on lacunae, traumas, secrets and the unspoken. These lacunae were inked in the past, but yet echo between one generation and another, from the past to the present and back to the past again.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What is your relationship to Africa today? How do you see your work as challenging our notions of Africa and the African diaspora?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was growing up in France in the 1960s and ‘70s, the Maghrebi communities (Moroccan, Tunisian and Algerian) were not considered “African” by the French. Perhaps this was to divide and conquer (or divide and rule) us further? However, in Algeria there was another narrative: we were African. So, my relationship to Africa is linked to my Algerian identity and the 1960s-70s Pan Africanism ethos that developed in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a political or cultural movement, the idea was that peoples of African descent have common interests and should be unified by their colonial histories. Justifiably, the story of anti-colonialism had created many alliances between Algeria and the rest of Africa (as well as other continents). I really feel connected to African culture and politics and follow what is happening there avidly. I am very interested in other forms of imperialism on the continent such as China's Soft Power in Africa. Due to the many conflicts, institutional corruption and poverty in Africa, China is gaining strong economic power on the ground. Perhaps this is another art project to explore!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as there are any forms of imperialism, racism and injustice globally, I believe it is our responsibility as artists to expose and question them.</p>

72,"Vigil in Perth","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fires were burning </strong>in every state and territory and some local groups in Perth had organized a vigil. A few minutes late, my partner and I ran from the parking lot to the yellow steps of the Cultural Centre where about 400 people had gathered in a circle. We joined them. Appeared casual. Saluted the hot afternoon with fresh beads of sad sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Cultural Centre is a plaza five minutes from downtown Perth.&nbsp; It is named for its predicament: move ten feet in any direction and you risk being asked to think. North, the concrete bastion of the State Library of Western Australia. Opposite, the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts shows off with a beer garden in a red building older than Federated Australia. The theater is east. West, the newly renovated museum. Further west, Charles Sierakowski’s Brutalist bonanza built in 1979 to house the Art Gallery of Western Australia. Should you wish to flee, the train station is south.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When people hold events in the Cultural Centre, they do so not for Barthes or Basquiat, but for the yellow steps, which function as a kind of public amphitheater. In front of the steps is a giant television monitor. High up on stilts, perfectly erect, it brings people down even on days when nothing is happening. By the time we took our seats the vigil was a go. People were clapping. So I put my hands together too, desperate for clues. A man approached the microphone. Flames were burning on the screen behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“We’re gonna hold a vigil together,” he said, “to come together in spirit.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If flip-flops and shorts were a tone of voice, this man sounded like summer. Inviting us to mourn fires that had already burned 25 million acres and killed 27 people and more than a billion animals, he could have been a swimming teacher talking about next week’s lesson. Then, perhaps self-conscious of past wrongs, he pleaded, “We’re not here to lecture you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the center of the plaza, a few feet from where he was talking, Aboriginal elders sat together, their faces firm and downturned. Before them two pails of smoldering leaves lent wisps of smoke through the air, white and light as steam. Perth sits on Noongar land, and the leaves would have been set alight during the Welcome to Country ceremony we’d missed as latecomers. Extending around the speakers was the wooly circle of mourners, the Green Left, momentarily on leave from saving the planet. And, I suspected, intensely pessimistic about the beer garden next door, where someone had begun laughing their way into a kind of choking shriek. In retaliation the circle cheered for the next speaker, a stocky, gruff volunteer firefighter named Ben. As he told us about himself—he was 18 years old and had been fighting fires for the past four—a baby, on the run from her father, began to waddle up and down the steps around me, pulling at my instincts to steady her each time she neared an edge. She made a temporary home out of my shoe. Meanwhile Ben was trying to tell us that last week he’d seen fires burn more than half of the Stirling Range, a once pristine national park in Western Australia home to more than 1500 species of flora. What a mess.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>In Australia, fires <em>are</em> the landscape, and have been for thousands of years. And while we’ve had disasters in the past...never before has this natural process transmogrified into the needy Old Testament God it is today, demanding acre after acre and life after life not just once or twice in the summer, but for the entire goddamned season.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I’d </strong>never<strong> </strong>been to the Stirling Range, or to most of the forests and bush lands where fires were burning. The Range is a four-hour drive south. Rural. Loved for its mountains and wildflowers. But as in the valleys of the Darling Downs in Queensland, and Gospers Mountain in New South Wales, and the shores of Mallacoota in Victoria, and Canberra’s hills in the Capital, and Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and so on, and so on, the now charred earth of the place, the acres of burnt trees left standing like grim toothpicks, the ceaseless flames and frayed nicotine skies had all reached me online, day after day, since September.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1939, long before the revolving firescapes of our contemporary moment, H.G. Wells visited Australia and saw firsthand a fire in Canberra. He shared his account in a local paper:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The bush fire is not an orderly invader, but a guerilla warrior. It advances by rushes, by little venomous tongues of fire in the grass. It spreads by sparks from burning leaves and bark. Its front is miles deep. It is here, it is there, like a swarm of venomous wasps. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But he’s wrong. Fires are not guerillas divorced from the landscape. In Australia, fires <em>are</em> the landscape, and have been for thousands of years. And while we’ve had disasters in the past—Ash Wednesday in 1983, Black Saturday in 2009, to name just two—never before has this natural process transmogrified into the needy Old Testament God it is today, demanding acre after acre and life after life not just once or twice in the summer, but for the entire goddamned season. How are we supposed to lounge on the beach when even the beach is burning?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ben blamed this “climate emergency” on conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is famously pro coal (he once lifted a piece of coal in the air while speaking in the House of Representatives and, in the words of Australian novelist Richard Flanagan, “waved [it] around like it was the sacred Host”). The crowd cheered. Perhaps Ben was right. Morrison’s appetite for coal is not helping the world’s carbon detox. But the Prime Minister is a small man in a history of small men.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next speaker, Dr. Sean Winter, a volunteer firefighter, began by acknowledging that we were meeting on the land of the Whadjuk Noongar people. “And perhaps,” he said earnestly, “if we’d continued with the ways of First Nations we wouldn’t”—a howl in the beer garden drowned his words and I finished his sentence—“be trying to fix this shit.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Winter was brilliantly frank. The volunteer firefighting model, he said, was broken. With low humidity, high heat, and high winds the new norm, fires were burning bigger and with less time in between. He and the 100,000 firefighters shielding the country couldn’t keep up. The reason? Summer, his name’s rival, was on meth.&nbsp; “The season is getting longer and our window for [controlled] burning is getting shorter. And we’re only one degree of warming,” he said. “This is just the start. It’s going to get worse.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>""We need to love the air that we breathe, we need to love sacred things for things to change.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>15 </strong>minutes<strong> </strong>had passed. The workday was officially done for. More people in suits and blouses began perusing the vigil like shadows. The host called for the next speaker and when he didn’t show, one of the Noongar elders seated nearby seized the microphone, forewent an introduction. She was passionate. The last of the day’s light slid over the library as she spoke.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“Once we start acknowledging the true history of this country,” she said, forthright with care, “we will heal together as one. We as Aboriginal people, we come from this Mother Earth—we is that plant, we is that gum tree, we is that koala. We must commit to this boodja, this land our country.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Noongar man Daniel Garlett, deemed missing moments ago, had been found. Now he called on governments to rekindle Aboriginal land management practices extinguished by colonization—like low-level mosaic burning through heavy understory. Victor Steffensen takes this up in <em>Fire Country: How Indigenous Fire Management Could Help Save Australia</em>. “The country is suffering,” he writes, “because no one knows how to look after the fire anymore.” But Garlett’s ancestral knowledge had been nothing but wind in white ears. And like the impassioned elder who spoke before him, he pleaded for unity and love. What else could he do for a mostly white audience?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Find it in your hearts to love life,” he said, “and not only your children or the next generation that are coming up with them. We need to love the air that we breathe, we need to love sacred things for things to change.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone nodded in a way that felt cold and religious. We sighed in relief, a collective groan. Got those last important claps out in the open. And then it was time for five minutes of silence, after which Daniel Garlett would play the didgeridoo and lead us in a silent walk down James Street.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For five long minutes I had a kind of emotional stage fright. No matter how much I willed myself to mourn, to feel, to matriculate some kind of violent sorrow, I couldn’t. Sitting there on the yellow steps of the Cultural Centre, a mourner in a band of mourners, staged before the world and its myriad lenses, I felt completely denuded of my capacity to feel. Of course, it was only the wildest kind of grief that had led me there. Earlier in the week, my partner and I had wanted to show our care. In a community. With others. The event had promised an avenue. And for most of the vigil I <em>had</em> felt engaged in a strange kind of care, my concerns for the country fanned by the restless urgency of the speakers. But left to watch the city dress up in night, hear its grunts, breathe in the smoldering leaves and beer and heat, I felt hollow. I began to long for the sound of the didgeridoo to cut us away from the silence. Break open this show. Send us out into the night in pieces. When it filled the air I rejoiced.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">The Decameron Project: 29 New Stories from the Pandemic<br>
edited by The New York Times Magazine<br>
Scribner, $25.00
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the year </strong>2020 millions of people got sick, went mad, and hated one another like never before. Foreseeing, or perhaps intuiting how the pandemic would unfix normalized and imperfect ways of living worldwide, the editors at the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> commissioned a group of fiction writers to channel Boccaccio and build stories of solace for the belabored mind. The result is <em>The Decameron Project</em>, a collection of 29 stories first published in the <em>Magazine</em> in July that remember, lament, and escape a strange and deadly contemporary moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most memorable stories in this collection, the ones that mold life, not death masks out of the past year, are the strangest. At the front of the line is Téa Obreht’s “The Morningside.” Written in the folklore style of her novel <em>The Tiger’s Wife</em>, it begins in a distant past, “Long ago, back when everyone had gone”—where and why everyone had gone is never revealed—and tells of a mysterious woman and her dogs who live on the 14<sup>th</sup> floor of a tower. Quiet surprises—an exchange between the dogs and a macaw, the mystical ontology of the woman’s painting—move the story along to where it sighs in a somber present neither like, nor unlike, 2020. This is, after all, a tale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":445,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none"",""className"":""small""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large small""><img src=""http://3.101.58.110/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OBrien_Review_the-decameron-project.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-445""/><figcaption><em>The Decameron Project</em>, Scribners, Illustrations by Sophy Hollington</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While other writers in the <em>Project</em> render in explicit detail the precise moment in which they were commissioned by the <em>Times</em> (Liz Moore’s “Clinical Notes” begins with the heading “March 12, 2020”), it’s Obreht’s refusal to situate her story in or around the coronavirus pandemic, hinting only sparingly at why people are “gone” that, perhaps paradoxically, lets one see anew and from afar all that we have lost. This illusion of a break in time-space affords rest, what Kurt Vonnegut might have called a Buddhist catnap, from a tangled present we have barely outrun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charles Yu also avoids the scar of a specific, instantly dated time in March in “Systems,” an innovative sketch of life in lockdown from the perspective of an internet search engine. His protagonist is a collective, neurotic, afflicted “They,” (hint: all of us), who searches nonstop for people, answers, and remedies with the obsessive compulsiveness of the most ardent cyborg:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">They search for things: First date ideas. Tapas bars. Tapas downtown. Wuhan. Wuhan where. Sushi near me. How to tell if he’s interested. How to tell if she’s interested. Good first date how to tell. Second date ideas. Italy. Lombardy Italy. Chinese virus. Trump Chinese virus. Coronavirus versus flu. Covid not that bad.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The humor here, like in Wu’s <em>Interior Chinatown</em>, is crushing, but, as the writer Rebecca Brown likes to say, “Humor orbits a dark sun,” and Wu ends up placing a mirror in front of the ways we search online and leapfrog wildly from question to question: “Why do some people say coronavirus not that bad. News sources trustworthy. Fauci. Fauci credentials. Fauci facepalm gif.” In these fast-paced vignettes question marks vanish like religions, replaced with the deadpan period of “They’s” digital syntax, a syntax of searching which the pandemic has shape-shifted into suffering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Boccaccio most likely began writing the <em>Decameron</em> in 1348, not long after the onset of the Black Plague, and finished in 1352. With a handful of editors and just shy of thirty writers, the <em>NYT Magazine</em> made shorter work of the coronavirus pandemic, taking just four months to bring their project from pitch (March) to publication (July). Somehow they did this with enough writers from diverse backgrounds to keep BuzzFeed at bay (the collection features writers from China to Chile). But whether or not all of the writers do, as the editors say, “help readers understand the present moment” and “provide delight and consolation during a dark and unsteady time,” is uncertain. Some of the stories soar in and out of the pandemic. Some were written too fast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this “unsteady time” is, notably, only the early days of the pandemic. Had the <em>Project </em>longer to gestate through a year uncut not just with a deadly virus but also intense race consciousness and an enervating presidential election, it’s possible that a few ACABs might have sprouted in the stories, or maybe a gunslinging Proud Boy, or the never-ending knitting needles of nasal swabs. Maybe the absence of these and other “characters” is passable, even unremarkable. No text can say everything about a moment, and what the Project misses of 2020 it fills with stories that swelter in some of the enduring cultural heat waves of the past five years.</p>

138,"Cocktail Hour: Mexico ’68","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">Born Annelise Elsa Frieda Fleischmann in Berlin, Germany, Anni Albers trained at the School of Applied Arts and the pioneering Bauhaus before teaching at North Carolina’s experimental Black Mountain College for nearly two decades. Her boundless versa- tility produced groundbreaking works in textiles and printmak- ing, questioning the divides between traditional craft and art. Recently, Albers’ career has been spotlighted by a number of retrospectives celebrating her legacy of revelatory innovation.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Anni Albers, a </strong>textile artist, was asked along with several other artists and designers, to create something for Ricardo Legoretta’s newly commissioned hotel in Mexico City, <em>Hotel Camino Real</em>. This hotel, this art, was meant to celebrate the now-famous 1968 Summer Olympics held in Mexico City, the first Olympics to be held in a Spanish- speaking country. Having travelled to Mexico many times after finding refuge in the US as a German-Jewish citizen, Albers developed a deep admiration for the visual language of Mexico, both past and present.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What she produced for the hotel bar was a nearly floor to ceiling rectangle of dense, red, stretched felt; a backdrop for the cocktail sojourns of the painfully chic. Triangles, some pointing upwards, others pointing downwards, swiftly move across the tapestry in a geometric motion. Several are a deep carmine, a few shades darker than the background, while others are only a few shades lighter. With these subtle tonal differences, Albers gifts us, and the bar-goer, a pointed meander in a field of red.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A celebration of Mexico City, of modernism, of 1968. The international community was watching the Olympics for the first time in color on their television sets at home. People from all over the world were travelling to Mexico City, and some of them would see Anni Albers’ tapestry entitled Camino Real hanging in the hotel bar. This Olympian tourism, virtual and in person, was colored by the warmly-toned hues associated with Mexico, and reflected throughout—Mathias Goeritz’s hot pink façade and interior gold painting, Calder’s red mobile. Mexican architect, Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, oversaw the look and graphic design of these Olympics, including the iconic, radiating 1968 logo, which was plastered all over the city, even on minidresses. The 1968 Olympics were also deeply colored by state-sanctioned violence, protest, and demands for racial justice.</p>

<p>Just last year, to honor the centennial of the Bauhaus, Albers’ red wall hanging was shown for the first time outside of Mexico at David Zwirner 20th Street, in Chelsea, New York. Albers’ exhibition was downstairs, while her teacher at the Bauhaus, Paul Klee, was celebrated upstairs. Zwirner’s international mega-galleries rake in half a billion dollars a year in sales from living artists and dead artist’s estates; and, with all of DZ’s industrial-strength galleries’ capital and sway, it is able to make “big” things happen, like shipping Anni Albers’ last textile work (she shifted her practice to print and paper shortly after) from Mexico for the first time since its creation in 1968.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a 2020 viewer, our reception of the work, in a whitewall space, is much more sterile and contemplative than the lively, jubilant environment of Legoretta’s swoon- worthy hotel bar during the 1968 Olympics. It turns a bold celebration of history and culture into a quiet experience, affectionately decontextualized (save for the lovely book with an essay by Brenda Danilowitz). This is how Albers’ work is now received, as Rothko-esque. The viewing condition has shifted from old-fashioned tourism to modern-day “art tourism” that you are likely to see on Instagram. Arrive, photograph, tag, post, leave. Next.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>[Albers] challenged her students to think differently about weaving—to think about it more slowly, without the added pressure of practical application.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It </strong>is important to consider Anni Albers’ trajectory as an artist, and how her work ended up hanging on the walls of one of the most elite, corporate galleries of our day. She entered the Bauhaus in 1922, under a crestfallen Germany. She described the weaving workshop as “underdeveloped” and “unorganized.” The students in the workshop were simply placed in front of a poorly set up loom, and in they put the threads. Albers disliked this lack of instruction in her early learning—the loom itself inherently stifles creativity, leading to a competition in “freedoms.” However, the students in the workshop would soon receive a proper weaving education from Gunta Stolzl and Benita Otte, who were sent to an industrial weaving school and brought back with them necessary weaving knowledge, including the more mechanical processes, like jacquard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This jump from informal education to a much more rigorous training allowed Albers to produce textile works varied in their design and production. It enabled her to compose textiles based on a strict plan, but also to allow the loom to dictate the final product—“medium specificity.” The intensely immersive environment of the Bauhaus allowed for constant exploration, cultivated by well known artist-teachers such as Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. Klee’s maxim, “weavings are serving objects” made a deep imprint on Albers’ understanding of its production techniques. From then on, Albers became committed to trying to keep the useful, useful, and the useless, useless. This is how her functional textiles, like soundproofing an auditorium with sturdy, cellophane wall hangings, came to differ materially and formally from her more delicately woven pictorial works that feature recognizable, yet abstracted, landscapes or patterns. This is “form follows function” at its finest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albers’ biggest source of inspiration came from ancient Peru, which she saw as the apogee of weaving technology and production. She lauds the work of the ancient Peruvians in her didactic book On Weaving, but her focus spreads beyond South America. Bouncing around time and place from Peru, to Egypt, Greece, to China, Albers taught multicultural textile histories and practices to her students during her time at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Weaving was born out of necessity, and its form has not changed drastically, only in speed and efficiency, due to the constraints of a consumer-based society. She challenged her students to think differently about weaving—to think about it more slowly, without the added pressure of practical application.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What distinguishes Albers’ weavings from indigenous weavings? Intention, geography, and time. There was no dire need for Albers to clothe herself or her family, to bundle something up for travel, or to keep herself warm at night. She did not have a physical or environmental need for such textiles and her relative financial stability meant she did not have to participate in the subsistence economy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albers learned to make weavings under the aegis of a professional workshop, a return to slowness, craft, and the handmade in 20th century Germany. She ardently believed that the good designer is the “anonymous” designer, “the one who does not stand in the way of the material.” In doing so, she continued the tradition of ancient weaving while incorporating her own geometric, abstract vision and playfulness with materials—ironically, her work is easily identified as hers due to her iconic style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another key difference between Albers’ modern weavings and those of the Peruvians is their pedagogical premise of starting “from zero.” As she taught her students, imagine you are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">in the desert, in Peru. Nothing is there. What is the first thing you have to think of? And build up? And maybe, for instance, something for fishing, or something for the roof. You gradually develop something, inventions, as you go along... and some of the students... like also the idea of not being told a brick is done like this, and we build it like this, but how we arrive at the brick?</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This zero point is of course a Western and privileged idea, and the groundwork for both Albers’ (Anni and Josef ’s) pedagogy while teaching at Black Mountain College in the 1930s and ‘40s. As a German Jew obliged to flee her home country, Anni Albers had to start from a “zero point”—learning to teach and live in North Carolina with a new language—although she never had to start over without resources, training, or social capital; whereas her heroes the ancient Peruvians, started from a point in time before the backstrap loom, threads, shuttle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is true that Albers was no stranger to modern austerity. Her time at Black Mountain College was overshadowed by the Great Depression and she often had students make weavings out of unconventional “threads,” like metal shavings and corn husks. In encouraging her students to return to this pre-modern “slowness,” mixed with her theory of “starting from zero,” Albers was able to somewhat vicariously emulate the way ancient Peruvians crafted their textiles, cleared of modern preconceptions, while living within a modern context. If she were to visit Peru now, she’d be greeted by local folks selling souvenirs that were made using the backstrap loom, the technology of their ancestral land. What does it mean when indigenous technologies of the past are morphed into uses meant for contemporary commodities, capitalism, and tourism?</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Serving as a backdrop for the bar, <em>Camino Real</em> functions as a work of art, made with care and sensitivity, that is meant to adorn a space and celebrate a nation’s history and culture.

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>During </strong>her many visits to Mexico, Albers began to collect ancient artifacts. But rather than digging through the dirt around Teotihuacán as an archaeologist might, she did so as a tourist. She described how “little boys” offered artifacts through the car window “just as turkeys and goats were also held up for sale” while driving to explore the ancient ruins. This selling of ancient artifacts to tourists in cars is the midcentury version of the modern day souvenir shop. This is how she began collecting artifacts to build a collection that was compact enough to “fit in two hands.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some have said that the Albers’ visits to Central and South America, and what they brought back (objects and ideas) are more considerate and thoughtful than grossly “appropriatory.” What they appreciated was the way that art was incorporated into everyday life, a pedagogy that was also taught and learned at both the Bauhaus and Black Mountain College. To put it simply, Albers extracted this ancient cultural production and process for her modern art practice, while at the same time, she championed them and did her best to honor them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her travels to and encounters with South and Central America heavily influenced Albers’ work and visual vocabulary. It was the architecture and textiles of pre-colonization that Albers was drawn to, and which culminated in the textile work made for the Camino Real in 1968. The hotel, filled with artwork by expat Europeans, was a celebration of Mexican internationalism. In Camino Real, Albers combines her training as a Bauhaus weaver with this new vocabulary. Serving as a backdrop for the bar, Camino Real functions as a work of art, made with care and sensitivity, that is meant to adorn a space and celebrate a nation’s history and culture. This is a different kind of “usefulness,” but one just as crucial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Albers became the first textile artist to enjoy a solo ex- hibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1949. Once again, seventy years since her debut, her work has returned for a feature exhibition. She also has an exhibition up at Museo Jumex surrounding her passages to Mexico. One can also, of course, purchase a remake of her metal washer and grosgrain necklaces for 480 pesos on the way out of the gift shop. Have her “useless” art objects become the most lasting in our cul- tural memories? </p>

<p><strong>“I think you </strong>said Rooshan Empire, sir?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is Rooshan, ain’t it, Wegg?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No, Sir, Roman. Roman.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>Our Mutual Friend</em> (1870), Charles Dickens’s last completed novel, Silas Wegg, a “literary man with a wooden leg”—he sells ballads at a stall near Cavendish Square—is hired by one Nicodemus (“Noddie”) Boffin, known as the “Golden Dustman,” to read aloud from a three-volume set introduced by its proud owner as “History-of-the-Decline-and-Fall-of-the-Rooshan Empire.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Newly rich but barely literate, Noddie Boffin superstitiously imagines books to be leather-bound personages who require a ventriloquist, like the ghosts in Homer who need fresh blood to speak. Wegg can read but is not terribly learned, so when Noddie asks him how to distinguish among empires—an excellent question—he is at a loss until a “bright thought” saves him.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Suffice it to observe that the difference is best postponed to some other occasion when Mrs. Boffin does not honour us with her company. In Mrs. Boffin’s company, sir, we had better drop it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having broadly hinted at the indecency of Roman history, and shown “manly delicacy” in doing so, Wegg proceeds doggedly to his task: “taking all the hard words, biographical and geographical, getting rather shaken by Hadrian, Trajan and the Antonines, stumbling at Polybius (pronounced Polly Beecious and supposed by Mr. Boffin to be a Roman virgin . . .).”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Commodious!” Noddie gasps at the antics of the dissolute emperor, when the recital is done. “Commodius fights in that wild-beast-show, seven hundred and thirty-five times in one character only! As if that wasn’t stunning enough, a hundred lions is turned into the wild-beast show all at once!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would a history of the “Rooshan Empire” have been any more edifying? In 1581 Ivan the Terrible, the first tsar, in a fury struck his son, the tsarevich, Ivan Ivanovich, a blow with his scepter, which, after some agonizing suspense, killed him. After a Time of Troubles came the reign of the Romanovs (1603-1918), epitomized by the Russian litterateur Dmitri Merejovsky as “Murder and adultery, blood and mud, ‘the fifth act of a tragedy played in a brothel.’ Peter I kills his son; Alexander I kills his father; Catherine II kills her husband. The block, the rope, and poison—these are the true emblems of the Russian autocracy.” So they remained until the night in July 1918 when the last tsar, the abdicated Nicholas II, along with his family, was slaughtered in a cellar in provincial Ekaterinburg—victims like so many Roman dynasts to what Gibbon calls “the vicissitudes of fortune . . .&nbsp; which buries empires and cities in a common grave.”</p>

<p class=""has-text-align-left""><strong>Empires </strong>always<strong> </strong>come down to the dominance of a state or people—or it might be several—by the rulers of another. Throughout recorded history, and no doubt before, empires have appeared in as many forms as the will to power has found the material means to enable. There have been empires organized along lines monarchical, oligarchical, priestly, mercantile, and ideological—usually, some combination thereof; empires ruled by living gods, like ancient Egypt, but more often by those who claim to be their anointed. They have projected their power by sea and by land, and varied in size from continental regimes like ancient Rome and Han China, which encompassed the “known” worlds of their respective civilizations, to the mini-Venetian Empire (12<sup>th</sup>-15<sup>th</sup> centuries), whose lagoon metropole was the size of Central Park, yet projected itself through trade and diplomacy as a European power. The Venetians would vaingloriously mark their rule with their winged lion rampant on a tall column; the lion smiling, if the locals were cowed, and frowning if not. In old Greece the lion was always frowning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not at all difficult to imagine the end of Empire, because history has witnessed the ends of so many; it might even be said such endings are what history largely consists of. It is very easy to envision what comes <em>after</em> Empire, because we have seen it so often: an encyclopedia of images extends from the writing on a Babylonian king’s wall to the red flag over the Reichstag in 1945 and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. “After Empire” conjures the jumble of stunted columns and exposed brick in the Roman Forum, and the 18<sup>th</sup> century Piranesi prints which are actually more evocative than the place itself. Ravenna, the last capital of the Western Roman Empire, has the air of a resort city permanently out of season, yet the handsome adolescents condescending to mingle with tourists in the old town are at the center of <em>their</em> world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Babylon to Britain, from Assyria to America new empires have been built upon the ruins of older—territorially, materially, and often ideologically. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when its merchants and soldiers were enlarging Europe’s dominion in every corner of the Earth, its scholars and adventurers were excavating and expatriating the monuments of extinct empires. Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 led to the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and a transatlantic vogue for all things Egyptian, of which George Washington’s pharaonic obelisk is the most conspicuous American monument.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Like a guilty conscience, looted relics installed in great museums pointed a moral, and still do. Shelley’s poem “Ozymandias” (1818) was inspired by the fragmented bust of Ramses II which he saw in the British Museum (and remains there); the poem imagines the tyrant’s “shattered visage,” unplundered, half-sunk in desert sand:</p>

<p>In the 1820s, at the same time Britain was consolidating its dominion in India,the painter John Martin, a provincial upstart from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was achieving a Warholesque fame in London with enormous canvases of 12 feet or longer, replete with doom and gloom, decline and fall. The most famous, <em>Belshazzar’s Feast</em> (1821), was viewed by thousands—the first artwork to require a velvet rope—and reproduced in prints that adorned the Brontes’ humble home and the tsar’s palace alike. Critics, led by Ruskin, despised Martin as a bombastic parvenu, but enormous crowds came to gape, revering him as a visionary, even a prophet, as he went on to enlarge his vistas with dinosaurs (a recent discovery, also invoked by Dickens in <em>Bleak House</em>) and the End of the World. Martin would fall drastically out of fashion, but his gaudy influence can be traced from the Lancashire-born American painter Thomas Cole’s famous five-canvas cycle, <em>The Course of Empire</em> (1833-1836), now in the collection of the New-York Historical Society, to the stupefying sets for the Babylon sequences in D. W. Griffith’s <em>Intolerance </em>(1916).</p>

<p><strong>The </strong>ruins<strong> </strong>of Assyria and Babylon were excavated in the 1840s by Sir Austen Henry Layard (1817-1894), a young scholar-adventurer abroad in the Middle Eastern realms of a crumbling Ottoman Empire. Layard was one of those indomitable Victorians, unshaken by difficulty (such as how to ship massive ancient ruins half-way around the world), a polymath, who taught himself cuneiform; in short, a perfect agent of empire. With the plan of following his father into the Ceylon Civil Service, Layard was making his way overland to India when he first saw the ruins of Nimrud on the Tigris and the huge mound near Mosul, marking the “common grave” of Nineveh. Once the crucible of world history, Mesopotamia was now a backwater. Layard’s plundering brought to London the blue-tiled lion frieze upon which the biblical Nebuchadnezzar gazed, and the palace gates of Nineveh, guarded by winged bulls, human-headed and hipster-bearded, which have remained in the British Museum ever since.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his essay “America and Empire” (1986), an admirably clear-eyed exposition of the subject, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. notes: “‘Imperialism’ did not even exist as a word until the nineteenth century”; which is true, but how long has it existed as a fact? And is there a principled difference between imperialism and Empire?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The great wave of European expansion took place in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,” writes Schlesinger, the political biographer of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the court historian of the Kennedys. “It provoked no systematic analysis of causes. Explorers, <em>conquistadores</em>, friars and settlers were doing what came naturally—claiming land, seeking gold, saving souls, establishing colonies.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when “imperialism”<em> did</em> become a cause and catchword in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the word hearkened back to a political arrangement half as old as time: i.e., the “personal sovereignty of a powerful ruler over numerous territories.” From Sargon of Akkad, the conqueror of Sumeria in the third millennium BCE, to Napoleon and Adolf Hitler, who each, about a century and a half apart, exercised a transient authority over most of Europe, the most dangerous place to be in relation to such voracious creatures was, exactly, next-door. Granted, the great exceptions: the Aztec and Incan empires were overcome by soldiers pledging allegiance to the far-away monarchs of Spain, although scholarly opinion now agrees that these conquests were enabled by the pestilences the conquistadors brought with them. Even so, the once up-to-date, now old-fashioned “formal” overseas domains of the European Age of Empire (“Hail, Britannia!” “<em>mission civilisatrice,</em>” and all that) were historically anomalous, and did not long survive the European civil war that lasted from 1914 to 1945. Proximity is (almost) always power.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Empire </strong>had<strong> </strong>a recorded history thousands of years old by the time the Greek historian Polybius wrote <em>The Rise of the Roman Empire</em> in the second century BCE. A soldier-diplomat born in Megalopolis, a young city-state in Thessaly, Polybius was among the 1000 members of the Achaean League arrested and carried off to Italy as political hostages in 168, after the Macedonians were defeated in the Battle of Pydna, reducing Greece to vassalage. Previous friendly dealings with Rome, along with his reputation as a military tactician and skill on horseback, recommended Polybius to his captors, the rising power elite on the Tiber. While most of the other hostages were exiled to the Etrurian countryside, and eventually died there, Polybius remained in Rome as an honored guest in the household of Aemilius Paullus, the Roman general whose troops had detained him, and was adopted as a mentor by Paullus’s younger son, Scipio Aemilius Africanus, the namesake and, by adoption, grandson of Scipio Africanus, the Elder, the great Roman commander who defeated Hannibal at the battle of Zama in 202.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not too fanciful to say that Polybius lived in what was to be Rome’s future, before he set out to write—which is to say, invent—its past. The elder Scipio was disliked by Rome’s old-fashioned aristocracy for “his luxurious tastes and his Greek culture”; holding command in the field for an unprecedented ten years, and presuming to have coins made in his own image, Scipio presaged the Caesars; his Hellenizing was continued by the younger Scipio, who led a cultivated set of wealthy, warlike young men in which Polybius shone as an adornment. Polybius accompanied the younger Scipio on his campaigns in Spain and North Africa in the Third Punic War; freed in 151, he rejoined his friend and witnessed the surrender of Carthage in 146, which followed three years of siege and famine, followed by a desperate six days of street fighting. Following the grim order of the Roman senate, Scipio saw that the city was set afire, those citizens who survived were enslaved, and salt was sown on the ruins. On beholding the terrible end of Carthage which “had ruled over so many lands, islands, and seas, as rich in arms and fleets, elephants, and money, as the mightiest empire,” Scipio wept. Of course, as he confided to Polybius, he feared that the same fate might come for Rome in some distant time, as long ago it had come to Troy from which Aeneas had fled with his father on his back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scipio loyally supported Polybius’s researches and travels, which eventually extended beyond the Pillars of Hercules to the coast of Spain and Africa and to Alexandria. With his proximity to power and worldwide travels, Polybius was like antiquity’s Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Samuel Eliot Morison rolled into one. Immodestly but quite rightly, he proposed himself as the ideal historian “to discover by what process and under what political system the whole world was subjected to the rule of Rome, an event completely without precedent in the past.” And?&nbsp;After close observation and long reflection, Polybius attributed Rome’s rise to its singular constitution, which mixed elements, monarchical, obligarchigal, and democratic, such as Alexander’s tutor, Aristotle, had distinguished; adding that the ruling class buttressed the regime with a religious cult; superstition, which Greeks held in contempt, was what kept the Roman commonwealth together.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In </strong>his<strong> </strong>generation, Polybius had grown up amid the giant fragments of Alexander’s Cosmopolis, the world-state that became a “dissolving dream” after the conqueror’s early death, when his empire was divided by his successors, the Diodachi, but was revived for half a millennium by Rome.Two thousand years later, the Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) went back to the same ancient empires to show “what imperialism looks like when it is not mere words.” Schumpeter, too, wrote at a time, during the First World War, when the world order in which he had grown up—specifically, the aristocratic and cosmopolitan milieu so well conjured by Frederic Morton’s classic <em>A Nervous Splendor </em>(1979)<em>—</em>was a “dissolving dream.” His essay on “The Sociology of Imperialisms” was published in 1918, the year in which the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires collapsed. 1918 was a time for long views, and Schumpeter’s view was at once very long and brutally reductionist; he was intent to find the “one basic trait common to all, even the most modern brand of imperialism—a trait which for that reason alone cannot very well be the product of modern economic evolution.” That done, Schumpeter could relegate to footnotes, if he bothered with them at all, the scholastic arguments about finance capital, overseas markets, overproduction, and nationalism which preoccupied bourgeois and Marxist explainers of imperialism (J.A. Hobson among the former, Rudolph Hilferding, Rosa Luxembourg, V.I. Lenin, among the latter).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Schumpeter’s inquiry begins with the oldest known imperialism, the Egyptian. As he&nbsp;tells, a thousand years of peace during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, disturbed by little more than border skirmishes, was ended late in the second millennium BCE by the invasion and century-long occupation by the mysterious “sea people” known as the Hyksos. Hitherto, Egypt was a timeless self-sufficient feudal regime dominated by a “latifundian nobility” and tilled by a “nation of peasants”; soldiering as a regular occupation barely existed; “for the country, while easy to defend, was quite unsuitable as a base for a policy of conquest in the grand manner.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All this changed when the long war of liberation against the sea people led to the social and political revolution sponsored by the pharaohs of the New Kingdom. “This new social and political organization was essentially a war machine. . . . <em>Created by wars that required it, the machine now created the wars it required</em>. A will for broad conquest without tangible limits, for the capture of positions that was manifestly untenable—this was typical imperialism.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet conquest for its own sake never defined Egypt’s polity or culture as completely and definitively it did Assyria, the ancient autocracy that most fascinated and horrified Schumpeter. In its brief and terrible day, in the eighth century, it was a perfect theater of cruelty, even or especially in the reigns of its most culture-loving kings, Ashurbanipal and Nadonidus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Year after year king and people took the field to conquer, lay waste, pillage, and murder, with pretext or without. The vanquished were crucified, impaled, flayed, immured alive by the thousands, or had their eyes put out or limbs struck off.” And why? Said the Assyrian king Tuklati-pal-fsharra I, of his neighbors: “The God Assur, my lord, commanded me to march . . . I chastised them, pursued their warriors like wild beasts, conquered their cities, took their gods with me. I made prisoners, seized their properties, abandoned their cities, laid them waste, made ruins and rubble of them. . .” Enough of this, and we would be in <em>Mitteleuropa</em> in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike sedentary Egypt, ancient Persia, which eventually succeeded as the dominant power, was always a “warrior nation,” meaning not that all its people were warlike, but that the leading classes viewed making war as their principal occupation; after all, they had come to “where history finds them with a sword in hand.” In 528 BCE, Cyrus the Great, having created his vast empire, was killed in the course of a needless expedition against a minor Scythian confederacy. His son, Cambyses II, marched west against Egypt on the pretext that the pharaoh had sent him the wrong princess in marriage. A “wild despot,” Cambyses gets bad notices in the <em>Persian Wars</em> of Herodotus, admittedly second-hand—but also first-hand, in the monumental inscription of his successor, Darius the Great, which accuses him of murdering his brother, apparently in one of his habitual spells of drunkenness. A modern French historian Pierre Briant attempts to acquit Cambyses of a “more or less irrational and uncontrollable desire to take over the entire inhabited world”; but that is approximately what his subsequent campaigns, extending from Ethiopia to Cyrenaica in North Africa, would suggest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yet the Persians, of all conquerors, were remarkably mild toward the people they subjugated,” Schumpeter says, and even Cambyses observed the rule. “The Persians did not ‘Persianize.’ The old gods were respected, even worshiped; the defeated elite were elevated to the imperial aristocracy.” Darius III reigned from the Nile to the Hindu Kush, but coveted India. His successor Xerxes more modestly aspired to conquer the Greeks on the western fringes of his world-empire, and was defeated on land and sea. Herodotus records Xerxes’s lashing of the sea after the loss of his fleet at Salamis. Persia never recovered its imperial élan. The axis of world history was shifted from riverine Mesopotamia to the Aegean Sea. In the next century Alexander accomplished his material and symbolic conquest of Persia, torching the palace at Persepolis, while promoting a “cultural fusion” by marriage and ritual. Alexander’s troops would not follow him beyond the Indus, but sturdy tradition says that once he had subdued Arabia, he planned to enlarge his world-empire with the western Mediterranean, which Greece and Phoenicia had colonized. Meanwhile, he made his capital in ancient Babylon, where he died of a fever, or perhaps by poison, in June 323, saying in his delirium that he left his empire to “the strongest.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As god and man, Alexander cast his lengthened shadow over East and West. In his <em>History of Civilizations</em> (1987), the great French historian Fernand Braudel succinctly relates the millennium between the conquests of the Greeks and the Macedonians and the invasion of Arabs in the seventh century. “Those ten centuries, broadly speaking, were an extraordinary ‘colonial’ period, during which the Greeks dominated an immense ill-defined area between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. . . . Although moving among their subjects, they did not mix with them: they never lived in the countryside, which remained foreign territory. In fact, the tiny Graeco-Macedonian people colonized this vast tract of Asia as Europeans later colonized Africa, imposing their language and administration and imparting some of their dynamism.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the West, Alexander’s brief hegemony became spur to the ambition of the all-conquering Romans. Dying, he became his admirers, the future emperors. Plutarch and Suetonius record that Julius Caesar, coming across a statue of Alexander in Cadiz, Spain, wept to think that the Macedonian had conquered the world and died at 32, while, a year older, he had only just begun. (In the <em>Pensées</em>, Pascal says that at his age Caesar should have known better than to want the world.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Macedonian’s most lasting monument was Alexandria, the world-city, “which,” according to Spengler in <em>The Decline of the West </em>(1918, 1922), “reduced old Greece at one stroke to the provincial level, and which even Rome, even the resettled Carthage, even Byzantium, could not suppress.” It would require the Arab nationalism of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century finally to extinguish Alexander’s imperial spell.</p>

<p><strong>The core concept </strong>of group exhibitions is simple: the pursuit of thematic cohesion. When executed well such exhibitions can accommodate a plurality of experiences through a singular vision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Topical group exhibitions are not uncommon in Los Angeles, what is novel is that current anxieties have become the curatorial starting point. In June 2020, Night Gallery opened its tenth anniversary program <em>Majeure Force</em> with a roster of 41 artists unfurled in two back-to-back exhibitions. Drawing from the contractual phrase which makes exceptions in light of unforeseen circumstances, the title also represents a self-congratulatory nod to the gallery’s continued dominance in the global avant-garde.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A confluence of twisting, grappling hands against a shallow pictorial plane in Jesse Mockrin’s <em>Blinded, ridiculed, pitied</em> (2020) is arguably Night Gallery’s most poignant display of restraint. Mediated through a subversion of Rococo, the oil painting conveys a cyclical self-determination as the figures, cropped and severed, play out an eternal tug-of-war. This tension parallels the nearby Italian officer’s firm grip on Amanda Knox’s arm in Cara Benedetto’s digital print, <em>TV painting (Amanda)</em> (2020) and carries into Rose Marcus’<em> Central Park (Bench Man)</em> (2017), where the head of a park visitor is decapitated by a veil of black velvet. This performance of body parts spills over from the first iteration of <em>Majeure Force</em> with Sean Townley’s <em>Red Ankhhafs</em> (2016), consisting of three, red cast aluminium copies of the bust of an ancient Egyptian prince.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Night Gallery’s two-part exhibition is overwhelmingly figurative. At its most bare, illness is about the body. In Daniel T. Gaitor-Lomack’s <em>Where the Hood At? We Right Here</em> (2019)—a precarious arrangement of found detritus—“hood” draws on the shorthand for neighborhood and suggests the imprecision attached to the geopolitical landscapes of Black spaces. That it also refers to apparel becomes evident in the next room, where a hoodless sweatshirt hangs unceremoniously on the back wall of the gallery space. Alluding to David Hammons’ <em>In the Hood</em> (1993), the levity of the wordplay masks the more somber undercurrent of a crudely beheaded subject, acting as a metonym for violence against Black bodies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Swaying from powerfully enforced realism to emotional mysticism, Night Gallery’s curation is a dynamic appraisal of the complexities of viral anxiety. While such analysis may come across as a projection, it is almost impossible to view art now without the tinge of coronavirus seeping into the surface of interpretation. This is only exacerbated by the intrinsically disjointed performance of group exhibitions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The </strong>perils of attempting to portray this complexity as purposeful, however, are made evident at Blum &amp; Poe. Individually, the works in <em>5,741 miles</em>—the title refers to the distance between the gallery’s spaces in Tokyo and Los Angeles—are well-conceived. Like Night Gallery, the title bridges the range of works through its comparable acknowledgement of the limitations of exhibiting amid changing transport and travel restrictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While several artworks speak to present conditions, many are simply token works of the gallery’s repeatedly shown artists. Friedrich Kunath’s pithy instruction to “cancel everything” inscribed on a painting of the same title effectively underscores the generally light tone of Blum &amp; Poe’s curation. Darren Bader’s installation of objects touched by the bygone glamor of old Hollywood perhaps unwittingly encapsulates the impermanence of material wealth that accompanies earlier artistic representations of pestilences. Bader’s fetishistic pairings of famous accoutrements such as Bob Keeshan’s gloves atop Neil Young’s staple gun sitting opposite Hugh Hefner’s glue stick in a basket once owned by Doris Day emerge as a sculptural <em>vanitas</em> translated fluidly into the gallery space. While yet another group exhibition with tenuous links between artists often goes under the radar, Blum &amp; Poe’s particular address—centered on the pandemic’s limitation of international travel—reveals its uninterest in engaging outside of its narrow, elite audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The limitations of coronavirus have cultivated a new precedent for the arts in the virtual realm. Viewers can access a 360-digital capture, self-guided interactive tour of ICA LA’s Ree Morton and Ann Greene Kelly exhibition on the museum’s website. MOCA has produced a range of online content from progressive voices including the anti-mass incarceration group, In Plain Sight, and a virtual studio visit with prolific filmmaker, Arthur Jafa. Art spaces have also opened previously inaccessible archives. Hauser &amp; Wirth published a digital screening of the documentary about post-minimalist Eva Hesse in May to coincide with the reprint of <em>Eva Hesse: Diaries</em>. The high attendance of these events suggests a public desire for further online engagement.</p>

359,"Review: The de Young Open","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The downstairs galleries</strong> of San Francisco’s de Young Museum are overflowing with a nearly indigestible amount of artworks. 877 of them from 762 Bay Area artists, to be exact. It’s staggering to imagine that only 8% of the submissions were selected from the pool of applicants for the year’s long-anticipated <em>de Young Open</em>. And, unlike 99.9% of museum exhibitions, everything was for sale. With practically every spare inch of wall space occupied—floor to ceiling—I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was wandering through a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with canvases in place of beach towels and cookware.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tend to prefer smaller exhibitions, ones that I can go through slowly, that aren’t crowded, with people or with artwork. One of the reasons I go to a museum is to enjoy the analog viewing experience, and I do not like having to rely on my cell phone to properly appreciate an exhibition. However, the digital system that was provided—scanning a QR code to access the gallery guide—did offer me the chance to search the works that really drew me in at first glance.Since the system prescribed felt unwieldy, I resorted to taking a picture of each work that I liked, being sure to include its corresponding number, so that I could learn more later. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My favorites all had one thing in common: they were quiet. A notable work is <a href=""https://deyoungopenexhibition.artcall.org/submissions/qr-view/168636"">Peter Wallis’ <em>What Remains of the Dawn-Land</em></a><em>, </em>a sparse drawing featuring a Colonial soldier skeleton, women dancing ritualistically under a crescent moon, and an indigenous person in traditional clothing, all grouped together next to a suburban strip mall. The drawing’s parsed-out starkness, along with the vibrant pockets of color, stood out. The mystery of the figures, isolated yet conjoined on the same piece of paper, leaves one with murmuring questions. I can hear the silence and the stories of this old, unknowable American place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two other standouts were the paintings <a href=""https://deyoungopenexhibition.artcall.org/submissions/qr-view/170706""><em>Outsider</em> by Youngmin Kim</a>, and <a href=""https://deyoungopenexhibition.artcall.org/submissions/qr-view/171764""><em>Out on Moraga </em>by John Musgrove</a>. While paintings like Wallis’ do not correspond directly to Californian themes, these two certainly did. <em>Outsider </em>refers to the way the artist, originally from East Asia, characterizes their position as immigrant in California. They tell us, “I recognize myself as a stranger through the exotic landscape of trees scattered on a dry desert-like meadow.” I certainly felt this way on my first drive through California, over a decade ago, encountering the brittle, austere flora dotting the yellow hillsides. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The quicksilver abstract figure that takes up the foreground emphasizes a feeling of incongruence. John Musgrove’s painting, on the other hand, comes out of an intense infatuation and familiarity with a landscape. The scene near San Francisco’s Ocean Beach is unmistakable: the expansive, curving sky; dusty two-story apartments; open roads lined with parked cars; the absence of any visible people. Anyone who ventures out to the Sunset District (or is lucky enough to live there) will recognize this painting as a veridical yet highly stylized depiction of a beautiful, hopeful day in sunny San Francisco. Isn’t it a wonderful place to be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the de Young Museum closed for the second time in late November, I lost the opportunity to give these works the repeat viewing they deserve. If there were another iteration of this show, I’d like to see the art more spaced out—either physically or over time, split into two parts, just as Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive did with their inaugural “Way Bay” and “Way Bay 2.” For now, I will patiently await the day the de Young can re-open the <em>Open</em>. In the meantime, the works remain for sale and 100% of the proceeds go to the artists.</p>

<p><strong>I like to think of the photographer as a detective.</strong> In a good mystery there is nothing superfluous. Every word, every sentence, answers its end; every scene is charged with symbolic import. The detective is the one who looks, who wades through the morass of persons, objects, and events in search of one idea which will illuminate a hidden truth. The quotidian world often lacks this sense of intention. And yet, the photographer meets the world head-on with conviction. Through the lens of the camera, the world is seen, tried, laid bare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The story of California is deceptive, elusive, romantic—by many accounts the stuff of a great mystery. Deluded into thinking the fodder of 16th century Spanish writer Garci de Montalvo’s romances of Queen Califia and her golden terrestrial paradise were real, Cabrillo and his gang set sail to find the great “northern mystery” only to come across peaceful hunter-gatherers. After a snowstorm in the Sierras, the Donner-Reed party ate their own dead to reach Sacramento. Even if California is relatively young, geologically speaking, the land has a deceptively grizzled look, as though it is saturated with the accumulations of old age. The role of the detective is to uncover the essentials, to lay bare the facts; the detective chooses which of the loud bunch are worth the attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Historian Mike Davis has called Joseph Blum the Lewis Hine of our generation. Blum’s hands have touched the iron and steel and soot and dust of Bay Area shipyards and shops for over a quarter century. His finger on the shutter trigger knows, instinctively, the story lies in the hands of the men and women before him who have built California piece by massive piece. His careful eye demystifies the mirage factory, glorifies the act of creation, reminds us the whole is the mosaic of individual, hard-working hands. Blum’s lens lays bare for us the truth that beckons beyond the histories of a handful of “great men.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the start of James M. Cain’s immortal <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em>, Nick Papadakis, the doomed Greek, observes, “No fog, like in a Los Angeles… all a time nice a clear.” The majestic natural makeup of California’s topography and climate has served to seduce and consume, to enlighten and distract, throughout its dalliance with civilization. To point the lens on California itself, as Collette Wylie has done, is to pay particular attention to the mechanisms of plot, to the physical world that determines the rules of play. Her elegantly serene photographs have the effect of capturing a great figure in repose. Every scene of exquisite silence carries a portent of great magnitude. Where Ansel Adams elucidated the inspiration and redemptive power of the American West, Wylie pursues the angles shrouded in the opaque and untenable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As adventurous and startlingly aware as Raymond Chandler would have it, our photographers have remained steadfast in their devotion to the discovery, and to the revealing. California, if only in a fragment of its many forms, is here for all to see.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">There are few art forms that exude classicism and ancien régime more than ballet. In actuality, nothing embodies better the dynamism, fluidity, and potential of the human spirit.  This conversation was held digitally over Zoom in December 2020, two months after the four of us had performed together in “Can You Hear Me,” a clandestine performance in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park scripted and directed by Luna Izpisua Rodriguez. While our shared interest in encouraging the individualism of performers and expanding multidisciplinary creativity across the performing arts came together during the show, the conversations that probe the traditions of classical dance have continued. This conversation was condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer""><strong>PC/LIR</strong>: Let’s start with some of the values and traditions in ballet that you encountered in your training.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MW</strong>: Well Xi went to conservatory for dance, right? Which is sort of the establishment for “traditional.” But America... not America, but the schools that we have are a little bit different.... The values my teachers taught me, it's all about manners and being respectful, things like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: There's two parts. When I started doing an associates program, they gave us a rulebook. You don't drink water unless you're told to drink water. You couldn't take your bottle until you're told. You always thank the musician who plays for you—you call them maestro, never by their name. These kinds of things. You don't talk in class, you don't fiddle. It's funny because going to the ballet program was very formal, you have to wear your uniform properly, you're told you don’t wear accessories, nothing. But when I started the contemporary program, people were wearing their hair down, track suits, black tights over their leotards, there was less etiquette involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: I think it's the mentality around dancing. When your mom signs you up for ballet over here, it's an extracurricular, or it’s “I want your posture to be better.”… There's less knowledge of ballet as an art form. Each level had a different colored leotard. Every little girl looked the exact same. Hands at the bar, doing the same thing. Little kids peed themselves because they didn’t want to ask to go to the bathroom. It was so proper. All these kids were crying because their moms were pulling their hair back tight.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: Everything was very “Balanchine,” which I’d never done before. I grew up doing RAD, or “Royal Academy of Dance,” which is the English style, everything is very set and linear. It’s all about the continuation of the line and working from the foundational port de bras positions. You never bend the hands. But Balanchine is very like this, [Xi very expressively raises her left arm up and her right arm goes out to the side with her fingers spread and a bent wrist, very angular] so that was very different to get used to.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: It's so beautiful and it feels so beautiful to dance. When I do ballet, or when it’s going nicely—because sometimes you have a day where you feel like “ugh I hate it, I can't do it right,”—but when you get those days where everything feels good, you feel so graceful, elegant, light as air.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: All of that structure creates really dedicated and determined people. You are submersed in it. You are living in that moment. All of that control outside you are learning to do inside your own body. You go into class and you know where everything is in your body and you can execute steps well. I don’t think it's necessary to have that environment in order to create that, because it's like what Xi said, it's your body moving. Ballet is the foundation, that structure that you can break at a certain point and play with.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: We had this conversation in college, but with regards to music. The way that classical genres are seen as legit because they are taught in a school environment, … the reason why hip hop wasn't taught in class is because the people who created hip hop were not legitimized by mainstream society. I think the same of dance. It’s changing now, hip hop and contemporary dance—things like vogueing—are now sort of in the mainstream and people want to teach them and bring them into conversatories as part of the training. For a long time, it was movies like <em>Save the Last Dance, </em>the ballet girls in the studio meet some boys at the club and do a fusion kind of thing, and it was this imbalance of privilege. But they are not dissimilar and they take equal levels of skill, knowledge and refinement to be done well. … The way dance is taught, ballet is your foundation and everything else comes out of that. Anything that is non-Western tradition is supplementary, is exotic—take a couple of classes for fun, see how you feel about it.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: Ballet is slow to evolve. It is deeply rooted in old traditions and is keeping alive the classical ballet that we’ve been doing for centuries. It came from court dancing, and that is still so present and highbrow. I do think our generation is turned off by it. I am turned off by that, myself. You are brought into this studio at a young age and literally put into a bubble. This world becomes a bubble. And you stay in that bubble. … Trying to decentralize it? We are doing that. Classical ballet isn't, but all of these iterations of dance do it slowly, contemporary, modern, all these different styles are doing it, pushing the boundaries of the foundations that they are so rooted in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: The theaters have a role in it as well. There's a place called Sadler’s Well in London. They have always been so prog, welcoming so many styles. I feel like they make sure that what is presented on the program is reflective of the country, the population. They were the ones that put on Akram Khan, the choreographer who mixes Bangladeshi dance with contemporary, and since the beginning of his career, they’ve supported him. Now he's massive, he works with the English National Ballet, and so many companies.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: I think it goes back to what Xi was saying about giving the audience a taste of everything. You have to actively educate the audience on what they are looking at. You can't feed them the same things just because they like it.

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: I feel like pricing is a thing. In London you can get student tickets or last minute tickets. You can pay 10 pounds and go see a show after class. And so… if you didn't like it, you could just say, “oh well I only spent 10, 15 pounds, it’s okay.” Take Zellerbach Hall [UC Berkeley’s performing arts center], they have really great programming, probably my favorite in Northern California, but it's so expensive. At least $50 at a time. Either you know who is dancing or, if you are looking to dabble, you might not want to spend that.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: I don't really know. There were two parts: my teachers had encouraged me to do it, and I went to see Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] when I was 12 or something. I had never really done contemporary. In modern dance, we would have one set that was like jazz or contemporary-ish, and I thought, “I'll give it a try.” At the time it wasn’t my favorite. … Rolling around on the floor I just felt so uncomfortable. But the more you do it the more you get into it. I had friends for whom contemporary had been their first style, so they were super fluent in it and could really move. I was always like, “I want to get to that level,” and so I just stuck with it.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: I always sort of wrestled with it after I went to college. I knew I enjoyed dance but I think I was burnt out or too concentrated in a single environment. I distinctly remember at ENB [English National Ballet], everyone was constantly talking about dance and I didn't want to hear another<em> word</em> about dance! I didn't care, just didn't want to do it anymore. … In dance school you need to have something else that interests you because you do it everyday.

It was kind of like: if you don't get into a company, you end up being a teacher—and I didn’t want to be a teacher.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How do you think you can show more individuality as a dancer when you're in an institution or even just in a group? How do you have agency as a dancer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: I think with San Francisco Ballet, even though it's a classical ballet institution, it has always broken the mold of uniformity through individuality. Representation is a different hurdle. … It starts in schools with accessibility and who we’re reaching out to and what we’re looking at. … Questioning what we value. We have principal dancers in SF Ballet who are <em>really</em> valued for their movement quality. I think if that's what you’re valuing, it should trickle down all the way through. You can’t just look at your principal dancers and think, wow they’re beautiful movers. It starts in Level 1. You have kids skipping around and you’re like, wow they’re beautiful movers. It's not looking at how straight their legs are, or how pointed their toes are. It’s about changing the way we think about ballet. It is strict but it’s valuing movement instead of lines. Now individuality within the corps de ballet, that’s really interesting, because uniformity for the core has always been “you look the same, one after the next.” You have brown hair, you're white, you can do the same Shakespeare ballet and look like iterations of each other. SF Ballet twists that ever so slightly because it has always been known for individuals. … We all have different things we’re good at. But we can be in a line and together and reflect each other [Maggie strikes a swan pose] when we are swans. <em>Those</em> traditions, <em>those</em> rules need to be critically analyzed. People say “it’s tradition.” But does it need to be tradition still?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: I think that’s a good point, what you were saying about companies wanting to see movement quality and individuality, but not training for that in schools. I remember when I was training, contemporary sounded like a more welcoming and accepting space for me. At the time it was like, if you are good at ballet you can do contemporary and have no trouble. I look back and there were maybe racial pieces to it as well. At the time there wasn't anyone Black in the Royal Ballet or the English National Ballet so it was hard to envision yourself there. But in contemporary, you’d see one or two Black dancers. And then there's Alvin Ailey. Teachers would say “Rambert would be a great school for you because you’ll get to do ballet but also train in contemporary. You’ll do well but also be accepted.” I think that can funnel people out of ballet because you have the technique and strength and then a world that will take your body as it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MB</strong>: It’s true. Even if it starts in school, if companies aren’t aligned with that mentality, then where are the jobs going to go? But what if companies can have dancers change the molds of things? We do contemporary <em>and</em> classical work. We are trained in both of them. It has to come from the bottom and the top to start changing any of it. We are missing out on beautiful dancers who are told to not keep doing it, or to do something else!</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">The corps de ballet is very interesting. In Western dance you are told to all look the same, whereas in West African dance it’s understood that you’ll all look different while doing the same thing. When all the dancers look the same, that’s a message in itself for the audience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: I think it stems from the idea that your corps de ballet is human scenery. It’s the tradition of dance. So it has to have an aesthetic. They have to move together and be able to dance together. As corps de ballet members that’s one of the strongest things we can do. The power of moving together and building momentum together can really have an effect on someone who is watching.

<p class=""unindented""><strong>XB</strong>: I do feel further away. It felt horrible not to have a studio to dance in. Finishing work and going to another screen was hard.

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>MW</strong>: I think it takes a toll, not performing. We were cut off mid-season. We had to stop dancing because the mayor closed the opera house. It is drastic. Dance is so physically exhausting. It takes a lot of maintenance and upkeep. … Having that taken away, and everyone feels that, you’re not <em>going</em> into work. There’s a mentality to leaving your house, hopping on the bus. To have it replaced with the confines of your apartment is difficult. I found it easier to go on walks and feel an inspiration. And I’m not that kind of person, at all! But sometimes I’d just bust a move! I can't recreate the structure of ballet class in my apartment. I couldn’t go there. But I could tap into what we’ve been talking about. Everybody likes to move. Everybody likes to dance.</p>

<p><strong>A guy in</strong> a Ferlinghetti poem divorces himself from civilization. He goes to San Francisco and falls in love with the waterfront. But even here, at land’s end, there are too many freeways and too much petroleum. The guy divorces himself again and plans to board a ship. He makes a call from a phone booth on a pier and says, “It’s All Over Count Me Out.” The fog lifts and the man moves through the city one last time, only to return to the phone booth where he’s expecting a call from lawyers with the final word on his divorce from civilization. The poem ends in obscurity: as his ship prepares to leave, the guy sits down in the booth and the phone rings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The guy in the Ferlinghetti poem is just Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and earlier this year the poem that was his life ended when he left San Francisco for good. Either he answered the phone or he boarded the ship—maybe both—because on 23 February, the same day President Biden mourned the deaths of 500,000 Americans to the coronavirus, Ferlinghetti finally got his divorce from civilization. A nonconformist to the end, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that he died of lung disease, not the virus. He was 101 years old. The lawyers had taken their time.</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two</strong> years ago, March 2019. I’m visiting my girlfriend, Michel, in Berkeley. Inevitably we hear about the celebrations planned for Ferlinghetti’s 100th birthday (the “literary-industrial complex,” so despised by the elder poet, has fanned his centenary into a festival). Chris Felver’s documentary <em>Ferlinghetti</em> is screening at the Roxie Theater. The Rena Bransten Gallery is running a solo show of Ferlinghetti’s paintings. At the Italian Cultural Institute you can see photos of Ferlinghetti’s travels in Italy. And City Lights is hosting two parties at its famed fort on Columbus—one celebrating the release of <em>Little Boy</em>, and one for the big day, the mighty century, of the Real Old Man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michel and I don’t make it to any of these. I’m in town only for a few days, and, as grand as Ferlinghetti is, we have things to do on planet Berkeley, like homework. But we show up at the San Francisco Public Library on 17 March to hear the City’s poets celebrate San Ferlinghetti. The saint himself isn't there, but the Koret Auditorium is packed with old bohemians, easily identifiable in their berets, red scarves, and the free verse cheers they heckle in the middle of each reading. Neeli Cherkovski emcees, and Tongo Eisen-Martin, Kim Shuck, Jack Hirschman, devorah major, Dean Rader, and more sing their favorite Ferlinghetti and something of their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back then, Ferlinghetti’s words were still new to me, and much of San Francisco’s well known arts and literary past—Kenneth Rexroth’s soirées, the iconic howl at the Six Gallery, Ferlinghetti’s own City Lights—were more myth than real in my mind. I grew up in Western Australia, far from last enchantments of Eisenhower-era 1950s urban America in which the Beats (and bohemian beatniks) coalesced in the San Francisco renaissance. But Ferlinghetti’s poems, especially those in <em>A Coney Island of the Mind </em>and <em>Starting from San Francisco</em>, remain as coolly anti-establishment as they did back then. Even cooler when Tongo Eisen-Martin resurrects them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike the other poets gathered in the library that day, Eisen-Martin is introduced before he is even in the building. When he does show up, he walks down the left side of the auditorium in a kind of weary trance, as if he’s neither stoked to be there nor unhappy about the invitation. (Apparently, Neeli says, he’d just got off a plane and come from the airport). He reads two poems. I remember hearing his voice and seeing his vision and falling into the “poet’s plangent dream” that Ferlinghetti writes of in <em>Pictures of the Gone World</em>. At the end of the reading, I convince Michel that we can’t return to Berkeley without stopping first at City Lights to see if they have anything by Eisen-Martin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course they do. <em>Heaven Is All Goodbyes</em>, Eisen-Martin’s second collection, is Number Sixty-One in the Pocket Poets Series (which Ferlinghetti launched in 1955 when he was still “waiting for a rebirth of wonder,” and not so caught up on divorcing himself from civilization). I lay a copy down on the counter—the brutal cover, rendered in pastels, depicts a mother, all struck to hell with arrows, clutching her son’s hand—and the long-haired clerk manning the register says, “I know that guy!""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“Apparently</strong>, too much of San Francisco was not there in the first place,” writes a sardonic Eisen-Martin in his poem “The Course of Meal.” The speaker continues: “this is the worst downtown yet. And I’ve borrowed a cigarette everywhere / … I’ve taken many a walk to the back of a bus that led on out the back of a / storyteller’s prison sentence, then on out the back of slave scars.” And: “I left my watch on the public bathroom sink and took the toilet with me. I threw it at the first bus I saw eating single mothers half alive. It flew through the bus line number, then on out the front of the white house.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few weeks ago Eisen-Martin performed these lines in a long, restless reading at the San Francisco Public Library. Only the library wasn’t on Larkin Street anymore. It was in the loft of a house where he was streaming his inaugural address as San Francisco’s 8th poet laureate, a lineage that began with Ferlinghetti in 1998. From that high-up place inside some Bay Area roof, incanting his words with records and posters on show behind him, Eisen-Martin turned his address into a vibrating party of poetry stacked with all of his friends and even his brother, Biko. Like all revolutionary poets, I got the sense that I was there with him, with all of them, and I wondered if he could ever be one to settle for a simple divorce.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">What Tech Calls Thinking: An Inquiry Into the Intellectual Bedrock of Silicon Valley<br>
by Adrian Daub<br>
Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15.00
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the 1999 film <em>Pirates of Silicon Valley</em></strong>, Steve Jobs (Noah Wyle) and Steve Wozniak (Joey Slotnick) ditch the scene of a clash between UC Berkeley students and police in 1971. As they catch their breath, Jobs says: “Those guys think they’re revolutionaries. They’re not revolutionaries, we are.” Director Martin Burke shares what is now a common opinion about tech capitalists, that it is not the antiwar activists “who were determined to overthrow the establishment,” but entrepreneurs like Jobs and Gates “who changed the way the world thinks, acts and communicates.” When the tear gas settles, after all, the activists have little to show for: at best shortening a genocidal war on Vietnam—a trifle compared to the iPad or blue screen of death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The idea that the tech industry represents a paradigm shift from tired old corporate America is nothing new. In the 1990s, we heard about the marvels of the “New Economy,” which Doug Henwood characterized as “the latest incarnation of an old elite desire to put workers and the ugly things that sometimes come with them out of sight.” The expression fell out of fashion after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, but the tech industry’s ethos of oblivious conceit is more embarrassing than ever. In a strangely-titled <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374721237/whattechcallsthinking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">book</a>, Adrian Daub debunks some of the more obnoxious pretensions that have emerged from the matrimony of venture capital and tech. What Daub is referring to in the title are those trimmings of pseudo-philosophy and intellectual posturing that tech industry mouthpieces use to pat themselves on the back. They see their industry as an ethereal, creative and revolutionary boon to society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strangely perhaps, some of Daub’s punching bags are not techies in the usual sense, but people he sees as representatives of tech ideology, such as Elon Musk (cars and Mars), Elizabeth Holmes (ponzi-pharma), and Peter Thiel (string-free finance). At any rate, this particular flavor of capitalist ideology that the industry has concocted for its purposes is fairly easy to ridicule, and Daub just can’t get enough of how inane it can be. With a flick of the wrist, Daub takes on the “genius dropout” myth, which is really just individualism and fake anti-establishmentarianism, perhaps with a faint residue of ‘60s counterculture. The likes of Jobs, Gates and Zuckerberg only need to dabble in college coursework, drop out, maybe drop some acid (you know, so they can think outside the box), and they’re ready to “disrupt” an industry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another target is platform-fetishism, especially in corporate social networks—a grotesque manifestation of MacLuhan’s maxim “the medium is the message.” Google, Facebook and Twitter are only responsible for the platform (the medium), and are so very proud of it. This means that the users who create the content, being non-employees, work without pay. And it means that these companies take no responsibility for the content, as they just shovel it around. “Twitter was happy to take responsibility for Tahrir Square, it seems, but Nazis are someone else’s problem,” Daub writes. “To create content is to be distracted. To create the ‘platform’ is to focus on the true structure of reality.” Now, this is all true, but why? Are techies so obsessed with platforms because they haven’t read enough Adorno? No, it’s the same profit motive behind any other industry. These corporations are beholden to their real customers, who are not the users but advertising companies. Every decision is made to maximize user “engagement” through ads, everything else follows. Daub is so delighted to expose the insipid ideological excrescences of the industry that he often glosses over the economic and social machinery behind it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In some cases, Daub seems to miss what is actually intelligible or true—even if trivially so—in the tech-bro shibboleths. For example, he derides the product designer David Kelley, who is not quite a tech figure per se but provides “an inadvertent example of what tech calls thinking.” As Daub relates, Kelley said that tech companies used to be “focused on products or objects,” whereas in recent years&nbsp; they’ve “climbed Maslow’s hierarchy a little bit.” The issue is Kelley’s glib evocation of Maslow in order to seem profound, the hierarchy of needs having become a tidbit of TED-esque popular psychology. Kelley was not referring specifically to tech in that context, however. And his idea, which really goes back to Edward Bernays, is that exploiting psychological and social drives in order to sell commodities is a winning strategy. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cars, for example, do much more than take us from <em>A</em> to <em>B</em> these days. They are marketed (and thus often seen) as bearers of social status and family values. The first example Kelley gives of climbing the Maslow hierarchy is his design of a Prada store, in which customers can interact with each other via video feeds as they try on clothes. Indeed, socializing is higher on the Maslow hierarchy than merely being clothed. Daub seems to be reading too much into Kelley’s pretension, and counterposes it with this: “Kelley doesn’t say ‘The philosopher Martin Heidegger proposed that human subjectivity can be understood only as a mode of being-in-the-world,’ or anything like that.” Quite. Bringing out the big <em>Dasein </em>guns for Kelley’s “human-centered design” would perhaps satisfy a few academics. But more to the point, all Kelley was saying is that corporations intervene on our fantasies, emotions, and social interactions. The evocation of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy is apt, albeit Maslow on Prozac—a commodified ersatz of his hierarchy’s upper strata. Sadly, this is the only hierarchy of needs that most people know (hence the need for Prozac). It is almost as if Daub cannot help but take the subjects of his critique too seriously—giving them too much credit as a launchpad for giving them none.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another example is a chapter devoted almost entirely to the sterile fascination with René Girard’s mimetic “philosophy” among accumulators like Peter Thiel. It is not that Daub’s deconstruction is misguided, he usually hits the nail on the head. Here too, however, Thiel explains in an interview how Girard influenced him, and it makes perfect sense. Both master and protégé are as shallow as Steven Pinker on Twitter, but what else would we expect? In general, why are we so interested in the idiosyncratic inspirations of such uninspiring people as a venture capitalist? Thiel could just as well have been inspired by Madame Blavatsky, Jordan Peterson, or any other bourgeois mouthpieces on their way to the dustbin of history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daub focuses primarily on the epiphenomena of tech foolishness instead of its core ideology, which is really just capitalist ideology in silicon garb: bootstrap-individualism and blind idolatry of the ruling class. For one, the tech moguls are in a better position than old-money capitalists to promote the false idea that they can do good while doing well. They are not as directly engaged in extracting fossil fuels or financial speculation, for example. They actually preside over the making of ubiquitous products and services, where true love is in unlimited supply in emoji form. Second, the fetishization of the tech industry promotes the false generalization from unrepresentative capitalists like Gates (who used to actually write code) and Musk (who still engineers at Tesla) to the ruling class at large. In other words, tech moguls help promote the false notion of the “genius capitalist” who actually makes things for the benefit of all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The latter myth is a critical component of capitalist ideology, or common sense. (Have you ever wondered why people evoke “common sense” as if the first word does not immediately invalidate it?) In a chapter that touches on this theme entitled “Genius,” Daub pans the idea of the (Ayn) Randian hero as embodied by people like Musk. Daub’s focus, however, is not his function as a misleading poster child for the ruling class, but just how ludicrous he happens to be. This is but another easy target—a walking meme whose tantalizing “vision” grips the unimagination of aspiring bros the world over. The important role of Musk, Gates and Zuckerberg, however, is that they personify the Randian hero simply by being billionaire engineers, thus giving the false impression that their class provides humanity with a useful service. In reality, even most tech moguls are ex-engineers at best. They retire from actual work once they become very rich. More importantly, the majority of the ruling class (the top 50,000-odd capitalists who run the show) have never been engineers, scientists, or thinkers of any kind. They are owners. And the only service they provide is managing the human species headlong into extinction. The tech industry straps a toolbelt on a deadly parasite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What of the connections to Wall Street, the military industrial complex, or the marketing industry? That is not the main thrust of the book. Instead, we get the sense that Daub is more concerned with the kind of intra-academic jabbing characteristic of humanities departments. There are quite a few critics who have dealt with the pernicious social and economic functions of the tech industry, such as Shoshana Zuboff, Siva Vaidhyanathan, Noam Cohen, and Meredith Whittaker. Daub’s book is an entertaining supplement to these studies.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Desert X</a>, a</strong> visual art biennial held in the vast desert lands of the Mojave outside Los Angeles, offers up some of the most appropriate conditions to view art in the moment we’re living in. Spread out across highways 10 and 111, the exhibition, sponsored by a California non-profit and charitable organization, The Desert Biennial, aims to “create and present international contemporary art exhibitions that engage with desert environments through site-specific installations by acclaimed artists from around the world.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With installations spread across miles of the desert landscape, strategic selection is key. First stop, <a href=""https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21/serge-attukwei-clottey"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Serge Attukwei Clottey’s <em>The Wishing Well</em></a>, near the James O. Jessie Desert Highland Center. In the Ghanaian artist’s large sculptural installation, Kufour gallons, cut up into squares and stitched together with metal, are shaped into large blocks. Here in the Coachella Valley, with the snow-capped San Bernardino mountains looming behind them, these blocks, repurposed relics of empire, speak to the dire international crisis that we will all face—and soon—if such desert oases continue to consume water so conspicuously.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alongside Highway 111, a twenty minute walk from <em>The Wishing Well, </em>stands <a href=""https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21/nicholas-galanin"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Nicolas Galanin’s <em>Never Forget</em></a><sub>,</sub>. 45-foot tall letters spell out  ‘INDIAN LAND’ alluding to the Hollywood (originally HOLLYWOODLAND) Sign, erected in the 1920s as an advertisement for a whites-only property development. In this striking piece, Galanin urges us to never forget the history of American settler colonialism as it relates to such sites. Thus, he says, the most important part of his work for Desert X is the land the sign itself sits on and the lost history it represents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, I stopped by <a href=""https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21/vivian-suter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Vivian Suter’s installation</a> on Palm Canyon Drive in downtown Palm Springs. Set behind the floor-to-ceiling glass of a typical mid-century modernist building, unframed canvases hang like tapestries. Unable to make it out to the desert due to travel restrictions, the Argentine-born artist Suter relied on photographic documentation to gain a sense of what feelings the desert inspires. Without ever visiting, Suter manages to capture the sense of endlessness and awe, with a touch of the true sublime, that we feel when looking out into the dusty expanse. Beyond the size of the work, it’s the abstraction and relative figurative emptiness of these large canvases, blended with bold and strong colors like black and neon green, as well as warm pastels, that conjures the shock and meditative effects of standing in this landscape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to distance and a shortage of time I missed many sites that appealed to me, especially <a href=""https://desertx.org/dx/desert-x-21/kim-stringfellow"">Kim Stringfellow’s <em>Jackrabbit Homestead</em></a>, which recreates one of the typical cabins built through the 1938 Small Tract Act. The outdoor viewing experience, which is standard practice for Desert X, meant this year’s iteration went off without a hitch, unlike so many which are bound to a particular venue. California has long been driven by car culture, something that can detract from the viewing experience, unless you are intentionally going out to enjoy nature. Desert X offers a thought-provoking way to enjoy art in nature.</p>

851,"Worlds: Geoscope 2","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Geoscope 2 </em>is a mouthful</strong>: an immersive, inflatable, multimedia environment—a white fabric, ten-foot diameter sphere sitting on a steel, fabric, and polycarbonate hemispherical base padded with amber-colored, backlit Stimulite<sup>®</sup> cushioning, externally covered with 46 ceiling-suspended Optoma ultra short-throw, inward-facing projectors—designed, fabricated, and installed during the first four weeks of 2020 for an exhibition at Princeton University’s School of Architecture on the life, work, and planetary thinking of self-described “engineer, inventor, mathematician, architect, cartographer, philosopher, poet, cosmogonist, comprehensive designer, and choreographer” R. Buckminster Fuller, who had briefly taught at the university some sixty-odd years ago. The brainchild of New York based architects Jesse Reiser, Nanako Umemoto, and curator Daniel Lopez-Perez, the project was conceived as a celebration of the latter’s newly published book <em>R. Buckminster Fuller: Pattern Thinking </em>(Lars Müller Publishers, 2020), and a continuation of Fuller’s original Geoscope workshops held during his tenure at Princeton. Large, unwieldy, and often shoddily constructed by his students, the original Geoscopes were meant to embody what Fuller called “the world looking at itself” and a means of comprehensively understanding one’s relationship to the world. Similarly, <em>Geoscope 2 </em>was intended as a cockpit and capsule to experience six decades of architectural thinking at a planetary scale, to temporarily inhabit Fuller’s rich and all-encompassing world in all its brilliance, abundance, and notorious eccentricity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In truth, Fuller was no great architect. His broad appeal arguably came more from the seductive nature of his overall vision than from his specific architectural and engineering solutions. In hindsight this is all too clear: his typically all-white, faceted geodesic domes were far too formally rigid and geometrically pure to be practical or accommodating, and his general outlook on design far too idealistic to adequately confront the realities of building and occupancy. Rather than a criticism, this is simply to assert that Fuller’s was an aesthetic project, as all utopian visions are. While the hippies of Drop City, Colorado, (built in 1965, abandoned in the early 1970s) utilized the economy of Fuller’s geodesics to cheaply engineer their slipshod, corrugated metal homes, no doubt they were equally attracted to the utopian underpinnings that such structures harbored in the genetic stuff of their making.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Aesthetically driven optimism is an unfailing hallmark of good architecture. It also comes in handy when you have four weeks to complete a large, complex undertaking like <em>Geoscope 2</em>. Coffee helps too, and I can attest that much was consumed in the days, nights and weekends between January 4th and February 3rd in 2020 as we prepared for its premiere in Princeton. Too wide in scope and scale for one office, <em>Geoscope 2 </em>was designed and fabricated piecemeal by a team diverse in nationality and expertise, with regular check-in meetings notably held on Skype, as Zoom was not then a household name. In fact, it was not until the final installation at Princeton University’s School of Architecture that we all learned what each other <em>really</em> looked like, having traveled thousands of miles for a few final near-all-nighters before the opening reception.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given its complexity, we likewise could not anticipate the final form and experience of <em>Geoscope 2</em>, despite countless coordination meetings and collaborative digital modelling. It was to our collective relief that, as we brought together each of its individual components—the upper inflatable portion from Mexico, the lower rigid ‘seat’ from Princeton, and digital content from Switzerland—its spherical elegance began to take shape in ways both literal and metaphorical, and (dare I write?) spiritual. Like an egg or womb (or more likely a bomb), surrounded by images of cellular mitosis, planetary bodies, and Fuller’s arcane formulations intending to unite them all, the many worlds of our expertise had at last converged into one. With its ten-foot diameter, the dome, grazing the underside of the gallery’s beams, illuminated the darkened space in swaths of pale blues and greens. For the first time we could all stand back, marveling at our collective accomplishment, and ask, in those wee morning hours before the opening reception, if only quietly to ourselves: “Exactly what the hell is this thing?”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The question is more common than one might think, at least in art and architecture. Fuller’s work especially warrants it. As he could only speculate on the application of his geodesics, Fuller nonetheless understood that they held a strange, ineffable profundity. They were objects through which the world could be read anew, at least to him, even if in ways seemingly ambiguous and foreign. Likewise in art and architecture, an ambiguity of application is often more compelling than a clarity of intention. Like a hammer or a wheelbarrow, art and architecture are but timelessly handy tools of osmotic transformation, perpetually useful toward undefined ends. As Fuller’s geodesics were co-opted at various times and circumstances to envision city-spanning shields against atomic weaponry, potential habitations on Mars, and, more recently, family-sized enclosures for mandated outdoor dining, our training granted us an optimism that, in time and circumstance, <em>Geoscope 2 </em>would also become profound and meaningful in ways impossible to foresee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As it turns out, these hopes were answered in the most nightmarish of ways. Now I can only wonder how many cases of Covid-19 might trace back to that well-attended opening reception at Princeton University, specifically to our newly birthed creation, with an interior diameter of seven feet and capable of holding two or three occupants at a time, that only in hindsight looked so eerily like a coronavirus, spike proteins and all. Or how our remote, inconvenient ways of working, making, and meeting via Skype would so fittingly presage the likely futures of work and leisure. And how the aggravating lateness of the opening reception “mission patch” souvenirs we had custom ordered from Wuhan was in fact very much excusable. And, at last, how Fuller had so well predicted that a hauntingly beautiful spherical creation, though not large, would one day seem to unite us all, a harbinger not of liberation but of suffering, loneliness, and pain.</p>

<p><strong>Far</strong> from ironic coincidences, these are but facts of art and life. I suspect they were not lost on Hashim Sarkis, director of the then 2020 Venice Biennale of Architecture, when he chose the theme “How Will We Live Together?” prior to the upheavals of that year. I too suspect they were not lost on biennale curator Paul Andersen, who attended our opening and invited us to participate. Of course, the initial thrill of our inclusion was soon to be blunted by lockdowns and quarantines, the cutting short of our exhibition at Princeton, and the inevitable postponement of the Biennale. To quote architect (and eventual <em>Geoscope 2 </em>contributor) David Ruy, “You don’t need me to tell you that things have changed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus, the once-inviting, gel-padded interior of <em>Geoscope 2</em> now presented more like a death chamber. Nobody at the Biennale could be expected to climb into its small, mostly sealed-off interior, potentially caked in the germs of thousands of prior inhabitants, the majority having just traveled internationally. It was hard to imagine a worse setup for potential contagion, and our options were limited, if not all seemingly ridiculous. Our first was to don each visitor with a protective Tyvek™ “spacesuit”—hat, booties, goggles and all—white like <em>Geoscope 2 </em>and akin to NASA’s ground crew uniforms worn prior to rocket launches. The heightened audience participation particularly interested us, as well as the visual uniformity between inhabitants and the installation. We could also monogram the uniforms with our official <em>Geoscope 2</em> logo, making good use of the mission patches that had finally arrived from Wuhan. That idea seemed less crazy to us than not allowing any inhabitants at all, or having visitors more modestly peek in through the Geoscope’s small doorway one at a time.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Despite our enthusiasm for the spacesuits, we found they were not cheap, at least when multiplied by the thousands of potential cosmonauts who would venture to Italy for the Biennale. Struggling forward, we leaned on the project’s original metaphorical references and decided upon perhaps the least Fulleresque solution imaginable: we would literally split the entire installation in half and open it up, so that viewers could stand outside and pass between its two glowing hemispheres. The result would be nuclear fission, no longer in the vein of Fuller’s hermetically sealed, platonically rigid Geoscopes, and consequently more explosive, open, flexible, and adaptive to the changing circumstances of its exhibition. This was all easy enough. The inflatable upper portion was shipped back to Mexico for adjustment, and welders at Princeton were recruited to modify <em>Geoscope 2</em>’s rigid lower half. Given the one-year delay, time was on our side. Yet faced with our new “cracked-egg” version of the <em>Geoscope 2</em>, it soon became clear that other things had to change too. Another kind of <em>opening up </em>was both deserved and necessary, warranted by both the Biennale theme and our collective amazement at ongoing events.</p>

Now preparing for a new place and time, the opportunity to turn the installation’s kaleidoscopic lens toward other issues was simply too great to pass up. The solution we chose, and now on view in Venice, was similarly kaleidoscopic: we would less curate than solicit content, individual topics and issues to be determined from a litany of invited contributors from within and outside the discipline of architecture. Radical ecologist and philosopher Timothy Morton contributed three short lectures, speculating on the ramifications of climate change in the vein of George Bataille’s “generalized economy.” With Fulleresque bravado, architect Karl Chu muses on the “global brain” and architecture's relationship to “being” in the philosophical sense. Theorist Jeffrey Kipnis more succinctly likens the powers of design to those of music, and architect Stan Allen delivers a short presentation on architecture's geological origins. On our part, we contributed two films: one a slick, propagandistic advertisement and embodiment of design's political potential, and the other film examining the contested legacy of Philip Johnson, its narration colored by nostalgia and grief toward both Johnson and the fragile art of architecture.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Our international team thus gathered again in Venice 15 months later, donning masks and Tyvek™ spacesuits (which we ended up keeping for ourselves). <em>Geoscope 2 </em>was reborn as a messier, more compelling version of its previous self, countless cables and wires slung between projectors along its outer surface, opening itself to new audiences and a growing list of contributions: a pointed, more light-hearted contrast to the deathly seriousness and rhetorical nature of too much of this year’s Biennale. With its glowing amber “seat” now inviting visitors to lean (not lie) against the facade and its upper half divided into four zones of simultaneously playing audiovisual content, <em>Geoscope 2</em> can now be heard throughout the other galleries of the Bienniale’s central pavilion. Like television static or the sounds of the city, it forms a soundscape hovering between clarity, distraction, and phantasmagoria for the entire pavilion. A bomb indeed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Words can only do so much, though I’d like to think the inadequacy attests to the rich, experiential nature of<em> Geoscope 2</em>. Jesse Reiser described it as a “cholent,” like the traditional Jewish stew where various miscellaneous foods, including vegetables, meat and bones were tossed together into a pot and boiled with water. Over hours of cooking on low heat, the flavors slowly meld together into something coherent and filling, irreducible to its individual ingredients. Similarly, the presupposed incoherence and cacophony of <em>Geoscope 2 </em>engenders a kaleidoscopic ecosystem, a tableau of world-thinking on the edge. How else more fitting to describe and experience this world, or rather, the many worlds of our dear mother Earth?</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Faced with the first wave of environmental warnings fifty years ago, a handful of visionary architects and builders decided to do something about the way we design structures, experimenting with new ways of building in the hopes of promoting a more sustainable way of living on our planet. In the first of a multi-part series, we take a look at The Outlaw Builders and former California State Architect Sim Van der Ryn.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On a sunny</strong> day in the spring of 1973, UC Berkeley professors Jim Campe and Sim Van der Ryn stood outside Wurster Hall looking at a wooden structure in the grass. It was an odd thing, almost resembling the interior of a two story home. The structure had no walls, and a small greenhouse protruded from one side. This was the Energy Pavilion, the manifestation of a semester-long course Van der Ryn and Campe taught called Natural Energy Systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a microcosm of how living sustainably could work,” Campe told me as we sat on his deck in Inverness, California this past winter, the smoke having just cleared from the summer fires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designed and built by Campe, Van der Ryn, and their students, the Pavilion housed a small wind generator, a homemade solar collector for hot water, (since photovoltaics were not readily available at the time), a greenhouse on the edge of the structure, a rain catchment system with multiple storage drums, compostable toilet, and a gray water recycling system, all of which were still dwelling in the margins of architecture schools and offices at the time. Campe called this “the core,” a synthesis of all he and Van Der Ryn knew about sustainability at the time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That was totally outlaw. We didn’t ask to do it, we just did it,” Campe said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once the administration saw the Energy Pavilion, Campe recounted with a boyish smile, “We were told to get that ugly structure out of there before commencement.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before they conceded to the wishes of the University, however, they held conferences around the Energy Pavilion, people coming in from across the country to discuss different systems of creating self-sufficient and sustainable homes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything about the Energy Pavilion was new. So new, in fact, that the papers they collected for the course readings were picked up by Random House and published as the <em>Natural Energy Designer’s Handbook</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had been only nine years since the revelation of Rachel Carson’s <em>Silent Spring</em>, three years since the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, one year since the passage of the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act was only months away from being enacted in Congress, as they built the Energy Pavilion. And while no one knew what they were doing when it came to protecting the planet, many, like Van der Ryn, Campe, and their students, felt the need to do something, to experiment, to play with new ways of building and living on the planet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we don’t have the fortune of novelty. Sea levels are rising, storms are becoming ever-more unpredictable, tidal flooding is commonplace in many regions around the world, and wildfires in the American West are often out of our control. The proof of the climate crisis is in front of our eyes if we choose to look; however, the need for experimental and radical action remains essentially the same as it did at the beginning of the environmental movement. Van der Ryn and Campe knew this, but it was often Van der Ryn who led the way, jokingly nicknamed by Campe, the Scout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He was always like the pointer,” architectural historian Greg Castillo told me. “He would be out in front, finding the next thing, finding the next wave. And then he would incite all of this energy and enthusiasm…and then people would pile on to that [new idea]. Then, as scout, Sim would very quickly be off to the next thing.”</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sim</strong> Van der Ryn, who as a child fled the Netherlands with his family just before the Nazi invasion in 1940, had always known that action, not abstraction, was necessary to make any sort of change. As he is quoted on his website, “When you escape one holocaust, you don’t want to be part of creating another.” When applied to building, this meant reconsidering everything—from materials, to the way things were built, and rethinking how to live in a community.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This became clear to Van der Ryn during the creation of People’s Park in 1969, when students and community members took over a large vacant lot off Telegraph Avenue owned by the University, and created a sort of improvisational communal park. As Castillo put it, it was a kind of “alternative world building project,” a place to experiment with new ways of living, like the famous Diggers’ <a href=""https://www.diggers.org/free_store.htm"">free store</a> on Haight Street in 1967.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“People were coming and saying ‘Oh we can have this plan and we can do this and we can plan to do this,’” Castillo told me, “and other people would say, ‘No that’s not what we want. We’re not doing plans. We’re just letting it happen.’ And that was mind blowing for an architect.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""I was amazed to see what for nine months had been a dusty, rutted parking lot now transform, with sod and flowers, into a pleasant place to be,” Van der Ryn recalled in his book <em>Design for Life</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The administration, however, had plans for the site, beginning with athletic fields and eventually student housing. Chancellor Roger Heyns ordered a fence be placed around the lot and introduced security guards to the area, effectively destroying the park. The administration’s actions culminated in a string of protests that ended on May 15, 1969 with “Bloody Thursday,” when “Dozens were shot, hundreds were arrested, and thousands were teargassed—protesters and innocent bystanders alike,” according to East Bay Yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experiences surrounding People’s Park proved tremendously formative for Van der Ryn. After “Bloody Thursday,” Van Der Ryn began to reconsider what it meant to build for communities and why anyone needed codes and permits at all if your ideas in and of themselves were good.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After People’s Park, Van der Ryn slowly distanced himself from UC Berkeley, growing tired of the bureaucracy of the school. In 1971, as Van der Ryn recounted in an interview in <em>Archis</em>, “I told the department that I had had enough, and that I wasn’t coming back to teach on campus. They asked me what I planned to do. I had just bought five acres near the Point Reyes National Seashore, and I said I was going to conduct a Berkeley class out there, with the students living there four days a week, and we would call it ‘Making a Place in the Country.’”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Making a Place in the Country” was an entirely new undertaking for the University, and something it wasn’t fully clued in on, according to Van der Ryn and Campe. As the course description says, students were to be given “experience in design, construction and other practical skills people need in order to live in the country.” This was only part of the reason they taught the class. A major thrust was a desire to help students reconsider what was good and bad building design, by building without considering codes and permitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We felt that in order to do things that were creative, innovative, and affordable, you couldn’t do it with permits,” Campe told me. They called this ethic “Outlaw Building.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the semester-long course, students mostly lived on Van der Ryn’s property in Inverness, an hour north of Berkeley. Students built and salvaged all their own materials for the homes they were to create, along with a few larger communal projects. None of the building was up to code, and it was illegal at the time to build with salvaged materials, which they used almost exclusively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was basically going against everything that a professional school of architecture stands for,” Castillo told me. “The part about teaching students to use hammers and saws, that’s fine. But to teach students how to build stuff that’s contrary to code ... — there’s no permit for anything—it’s all like in the most flagrant code violations.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To Campe and Van der Ryn, the laws and accepted practices of architects and builders didn’t always make sense. If the state or cities wouldn’t allow them to build something they thought might be good, they would build it anyway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“These were just things that outlaws would do,” Campe said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The class ended that spring, but Van der Ryn’s experiments were far from over. Two years later, again with Campe’s aid, he and their students built the Energy Pavilion. Once the school insisted they tear it down, an unknown donor (possibly a rich student, according to Castillo) gave them money to build out those systems into an actual home in Berkeley, which became known as the Integral Urban House, and stood until the mid-1980s. After the Urban House, Van der Ryn used a federal grant to create an experiential learning space in Sonoma County called the Farallones Institute Rural Center, now known as Occidental Arts &amp; Ecology Center. Still, as Castillo pointed out, Van der Ryn built parts of the center against code with his federal grant money.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“Sonoma [county officials] started to crack down on him and they gave him the message that he was accruing violations at the rate of like $1,500 a week.” Castillo said.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Around</strong> this time the newly elected governor of California Jerry Brown—politically unorthodox in his own right— called Van der Ryn to ask if he would like to rebuild the state capitol building. Van der Ryn went to Sacramento to look over the project and prepare a report for the governor. After a few more exchanges and two more papers he wrote for the governor—on renewable energy and appropriate technology—Brown called Van der Ryn and asked him to become California's new State Architect. To quell Sim’s worries about leaving the Farallones Institute behind, as Van der Ryn quotes him in <em>Design for Life</em>, Brown said, “Sacramento is just a sandbox for us to play in. You can go for what you want…I’m with you.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For me it’s been a trajectory,” Van der Ryn told <em>Archis</em>. “Those wild years in Sacramento were a wave; we just were there at the right time. Working for Jerry, I was able to get a lot done. I never took it that seriously.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking back on the class they taught in Inverness, Jim Campe told me, “We were doing positive things and many of those became codes when Sim became State Architect,” like a <a href=""https://www.deatech.com/pipermail/coblist/2003/007265.html"">class K</a> permit in Mendocino, Humboldt, and Sonoma counties, which allowed the use of recycled materials in building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As part of his work under Governor Brown, Van der Ryn designed the Gregory Bateson Building, a 250,000 square foot office building in Sacramento that, according to Van der Ryn’s website, uses “innovative heating, cooling and daylighting strategies as well as various analysis methods such as computer modeling of building thermal performance which have become the standard for energy efficient building design.” As the <a href=""https://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/hanging-gardens-of-sacramento#:~:text=Van%20der%20Ryn%20was%20also,der%20Ryn%20and%20Peter%20Calthorpe."">Architectural Review said in 2013</a>, it was “The first large-scale building to embody what we now call sustainable architecture.” Today, it is widely recognized as an important piece of architectural history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>[Governor Jerry] Brown said, “Sacramento is just a sandbox for us to play in. You can go for what you want…I’m with you.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Van der Ryn’s biggest contribution is arguably the Office of Appropriate Technology, or OAT. This department was tasked with assisting the state in “developing and implementing less costly and less energy-intensive technologies of recycling, waste disposal, transportation, agriculture, energy, and building design.” However, as Louisiana State University professor of architecture, Meredith Gaglio noted, having such “an institutional acknowledgment of countercultural values” in the state office made many bureaucrats wary of these “self-righteous, inexperienced, denim-clad meddlers” in their halls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“During OAT’s brief history [1977-1982],” Gaglio writes, “the Office grew from a small, countercultural taskforce to a well-respected State department while maintaining its core ideology and creative spirit.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sim was telling me in his good days,” Castillo said, “that for the Office of Appropriate Technologies they would have get-togethers in Jerry Brown’s office. People were sitting on the floor. There would be people coming from foreign countries just to listen in on it. It’s the first place in the world this was done.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Brown chose not to run for a third term and was succeeded by Republican George Deukmejian, OAT was effectively dissolved. According to Castillo, Deukmejian’s administration set “renewables back in California about thirty years. So the developments that we made... around 2000, should have been done twenty years earlier.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Van Der Ryn never seemed perturbed by this. In the same interview in <em>Archis</em> in 2011, he said, “We became, and still are, the most energy-efficient state in the country. We reduced energy consumption by 40% from what was then the standard.” Van der Ryn’s stint as State Architect was a critical step in bringing “<em>the imperative need for energy conservation in all current and future public structures” </em>to the forefront of the public and legislature’s minds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I returned to Jim Campe’s house a couple months later on one of the few days of light rain we saw this winter. As we sat inside, talking about the birth of the environmental movement, Campe said it began “in the ‘70s because it was the last time when our parts per million [of CO2] was at a sustainable place for our planet.” This, Campe went on, was the driver for much of his and Van der Ryn’s work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We need more of this kind of building,” Campe said. “We need more of this kind of experimenting. We need more of this way of promoting a lifestyle that is not so polluting, and not so energy consumptive.”</p>

<p><strong>One morning in July 2020</strong> I drove three hours to the sawmill town of Nannup. I had been invited to get in the way of some loggers in a neighboring forest called Helms, one of those whitefella names for Wardandi Noongar Country. This “action” was secret and the organizer hadn’t told me where to go, but a message would come later that day. I left Perth before sunrise. A good camper, I had loaded the car with one bottle of water, a carton of vegetables (including a lentil soup mix), Pringles, and three books of nature poems, which, I reasoned, could be used as fire starters if necessary. I didn’t bother with a tent, deciding instead that I would brave the conditions of the car over the forest. The drive was pleasant. The South West is full of paddocks. I didn’t take my time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>When I arrived in Nannup I parked outside the old Hotel and walked the main street. Nannup is a small town, and like any small town in the Australian bush, it doubles to survive. The post office sells lotto tickets. The bakery sells milk. In a gift store you can buy oil paints <em>and</em> oil paintings, as well as toy koalas. And when it comes to hemp, Nannupians, all 1,200 of them, are spoiled: there’s a hemp farm and two hemp stores, perfect if you like your soap green and local. As I walked I kept one eye on the town’s Lilliputian buildings and the other looking for loggers. But it was a Saturday afternoon, quiet as hell, and after five minutes I wondered if I was a ghost: in a gallery and a cafe both proprietors ignored me. When I reached the All Saints Church—it’s no bigger than a bedroom—I turned around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Days earlier I’d tried to organize a meeting with a local. Someone who could tell me about the town’s timber history. I found the number of the Nannup Historical Society and spoke to a woman with the bush in her voice, dry and brittle. After 11 years in the town, she told me, she still considered herself new. “You have to be born here to be a Nannupian,” she went on. “The community is kind and giving, but won’t give too much personal information.” Secretive, I thought, like me. She told me to be in touch when I was in town, and she’d see if anyone was around, like the old boys at the bar. But her words felt like a warning. Be careful, they seemed to say. I saved her number, but didn’t call again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On my way back to the car I stopped at a monument of giant saw blades next to the bowling green. Inset over thick panels of wood, the rusty, long toothed blades featured etchings of old Nannup townsfolk from the years of the Great War, those who had died and those who had waited on the dying. Here they were, the pioneers of the town remembered in the tools of their logging past, a past that was still spinning through the native forest where I was about to camp. A history safely contained, hidden from the eyes and nos of the city, out of reach. Just then there was a buzz in my pocket. One of the organizers had posted the location of a meeting place, a cabin in the bush. Finally, a summons.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This</strong> summons began two years ago when I found the West Australian Forest Alliance outside Perth Station. They were protesting the logging of old-growth Karri trees in Lewin (Bibelmen Noongar Country), about thirty minutes south of Nannup. Karri are magnificent gray eucalypts that can reach 300 feet and host crowns the size of tennis courts. They are native to Western Australia. But thanks to a lousy definition of old-growth, they were being torn down and sold as wood chips and charcoal for a silicon smelter. The Forest Alliance had had enough. They had set up a blockade in Lewin to stop the machines. “Come and see,” they said. I got in the car a few days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I arrived I found a bush camp in the ecotone between ruin and rescue. In ruin were the massive Karri logs, lying like fallen pillars, waiting for that last joyride to the smelter. The rescue effort was a few feet away near the surviving trees. In an act of defiance, the campers had repurposed the felled branches as support poles for a roof, forming a kind of bush hut. Next door was a tent filled with food and supplies, i.e. the “kitchen.” There were water tanks. A makeshift sink. Solar panels. Chairs. Even a wooden floor of salvaged scrap. People were coming and going, making tea, sitting round the fire, having a yarn. Everyone seemed in good spirits. I joined them on their strange reclaimed land.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jess Beckerling, the convenor of the Forest Alliance, led us on a walk. “A churned up muddy moonscape,” she said of the land stripped by machines. We passed into uncut territory, almost wading through the bush. She pointed out nesting hollows. The notorious snottygobble tree. Then she stopped in front of a lowly Karri stump. It was old, black, and half buried, the remnant of a tree felled long ago. It was why they were there. Only that wasn’t really true. They were there because the West Australian government had written these stumps into law to shore up space for logging. “Where just one tree has been cut down at some time in the past 150 years,” said Jess, “that 2-hectare area of forest no longer qualifies for old-growth status. Forests with all the characteristics of old-growth are excluded on this basis.” It started raining.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was dark when we returned to camp. Some people went home. I sat by the fire with those who stayed, listening to their stories. Everyone had their reasons for being there. Dom, the mainstay, liked the bush where no one could tell him what to do. Nathan wished the government would transition the logging industry to plantations. “Back in the day they’d come in and take the biggest, straightest tree,” he said. “Now they come and fell the whole lot.” All of this was new to me—the forest, its lawful undoing, sleeping next to bulldozers—and I felt embarrassed that I had for so long considered myself environmentally conscious. As if sorting my trash and walking to work and having the right opinions about coal made me just. But in this heyday of the Anthropocene, being just, I realized, is dirty. It’s crude. And it only works on site. I could march and shout in the city—and I’d served my time—but unless people were here muddying their boots, stinking their jackets with smoke and sweat, and surveying hollows to build evidence for their protection, the machines would keep churning. A few months later their actions would see Lewin removed from the logging plans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stayed one night at camp, barely any time to get a feel for the gritty activism I’d flown into. Two weeks later I was actually <em>flying</em>, heading back to the United States for work and love, guileless and guilty on a carbon-oozing jet plane. But I couldn’t stop thinking about the trees in Lewin, and people like Jess and Dom who had made forest protection their life. Strangely, it was there, on that contested ground zero, that I felt most at home. I stayed in touch. And when I returned to Western Australia last year, I messaged a friend at the Alliance. She invited me to an event where I heard about another forest known as Helms. A camp had been set up to protect its Jarrah trees and wildlife, but this time the police shut it down. The Alliance was planning a response. “Don’t tell anyone,” my friend said. I drove to Nannup a few days later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I</strong> arrived at the cabin feeling lost, damned, and confused, like some kind of disaffected tourist who couldn’t remember why he’d left the hotel. Smoke was rising from a chimney. It was getting dark. <em>What was I walking into?</em> Inside I found three women in front of the fireplace. They were whispering, and when they saw me I couldn’t tell if they were pleased or disappointed. “Is this the meeting place for the action?” I asked. One of them nodded, invited me over, and introduced herself as Dara. She said I might like to choose a bed while the options were good. I found a dusty single by the window, set my things down, and joined them by the fire. Dara had come from Busselton. The others, Iris and Daisy, lived nearby. So far I was the only one from the big smoke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each of them had a vague idea of the plans for the weekend, and they filled me in as best they could. The action would begin the following afternoon, Sunday, and revolve around Dom and Mace, who were on their way down from Perth. In the evening we’d drive to the forest and set up a temporary camp. Dom, who I remembered from Lewin, would climb an old Jarrah tree in the forest and stay on a platform held up by a cable tied to a bulldozer. Meanwhile Mace would circle their arms around part of another bulldozer, interlocking both hands in a steel pipe,&nbsp; embracing the thing for hours. The rest of us were the support crew, the caretakers of transgression. It was expected that the loggers would find us early Monday morning. They would notify the police. Dom and Mace would be arrested. A film crew would capture everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed like a solid plan, but listening to Iris and Daisy, I got the sense that they were a little skeptical, maybe even resentful. They’d been camping in Helms for months before their blockade was shut down, doing it tough in 47 degrees Celsius heat while much of the country was burning around them. Who were we, they seemed to say, flying in, getting our faces on TV, and flying out? I wanted to agree, and maybe they had a point, but I was so fresh that I just nodded and said, “I see.” The rest of the night passed quickly. Dom and Mace arrived late, and a few others trickled in, like Paul in his orange bus named Delilah. The next morning a group went to Helms to scout the area for machines and a climbable tree. When they returned we gathered in the cabin to strategise. The fireplace was leaking smoke.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dom came around with a plastic bowl for our phones, and for the next hour we assigned roles and talked logistics. Two “wallabies” would disperse in the forest in the morning to watch for moving machines. There was on-ground support personnel. The police liaisons. Hoisters. Cooks. A person holding an umbrella above the camera. I put my hand up for a media role, which meant I was suddenly responsible for getting vision to the press. We covered legalities, the consequences of civil disobedience, and how to talk to the loggers: “Oh, we didn’t know you were working here. Don’t mind us!” Everyone understood they were committing an arrestable offence. It was around 4pm when we left the cabin. Cold. The light fading West. We filed onto the road in a motley convoy seven cars deep. To get to the forest we had to drive through Nannup. It was still ghostly. No one saw us.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On</strong> our way we passed rich native forest, trees large and luminous on both sides of the road. If I didn’t know better, I might have thought nothing was wrong. But these roadside trees are, in the words of the West Australian poet Nandi Chinna, a “thin façade.” As she writes in <em>Forest Family</em>, “Behind the majestic roadside strips of jarrah, marri, and karri lie the clear-fell forest coupes scoured like gaping wounds in the landscape.” It didn’t take us long to find our wound. About fifteen minutes outside of Nannup we turned down a dirt road. We passed a bulldozer. Then another. Soon the trees started thinning. The sky grew large. The façade fell away. When our convoy slowed down I knew that we had arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We left our cars and lay claim to the clearing. It was very quiet. I noticed a smell in the air, a sweat of soil, sap, and slit leaves. Waiting between two machines was a long pyre of logs, many of them marked with “CH,” a sign of their charcoal fate. A lone Jarrah stood tall above the logs, ancient and undisturbed, a consolation home for the cockatoos who nest in these parts. “<em>Lucky</em> <em>birds!</em>” someone said, wet with sarcasm. The crew had chosen this tree for Dom because it was close to one of the bulldozers. With little light remaining, and rain brewing, he went up without delay. After we hoisted his platform and anchored it to the machine, he got in his sleeping bag and swayed to bed. On the other side of the clearing Mace had been getting intimate with the other dozer, locking themselves in its arms above the blade. We raised a tarp for ourselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The night moved slowly. I tried sleeping in the car, but I kept waking to dreams of loggers at my window. I went back to the tarp where people were talking and Dara was cooking chips over the fire. I met a guy named Ray. He was in his sixties, fit, with short gray hair. For the past month he’d been camping here, often alone. Before sunrise he’d wake to the sound of whirring, dress in camouflage, and chase after the machines. He was filming them. “People have to see what’s going on,” he said. “There needs to be more outrage. More pressure, politically, and then we’ll pull something off.” I asked him what it was like chasing a falling forest. He told me the hardest part was leaving. He’d turn to the trees and say, Sorry. “Sorry I can’t do for you what you do for me. Sorry my culture doesn’t understand what’s important.” The loggers found us in the morning. Dom and Mace were arrested. We made the evening news. Two days later the machines went back to work.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a bold decision</strong> when an institution decides to curate a show that spans the width of a city. This is especially the case when the city is Los Angeles, where West and East are separated not only by hours’ worth of traffic but also by varying histories and mindsets. In 1995’s cult classic <em>Clueless, </em>Paul Rudd’s character famously called out Alicia Silverstone’s ‘90s persona for getting upset at being mistaken for “living below Sunset.” West Angelenos are more likely to hop the border than drive east of La Brea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps this was the motivation behind the Hammer Museum’s decision to exhibit the same artists (except for one) shown at <em><a href=""https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2021/made-la-2020-version"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Made in L.A.: A Version</a></em> at its Westwood location and at the Huntington Library in San Marino. With this fifth iteration of the biennial, the Hammer set a new precedent by showing across two institutions. We get not a singular “version” as the title suggests, but two. (Insider tip: if you visit the Hammer first, you get free entry to the far pricier Huntington Galleries.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Hammer gave each artist free reign when selecting work for its two iterations. Unhappily, the result is a nagging sense of déjà vu as many artists chose to display only a particular (read familiar) facet of their work. Or in the case of Mathias Poledna’s film, <em>Indifference </em>(2018), the same six-minute narrative that follows an early twentieth-century Austrian officer’s idle perambulations through imperialist Parisian courtyards is projected in both spaces. Add to that having to wait double the film’s length (as a result of capacity restrictions) only to learn you had already seen it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Postponement is a common theme for the Huntington spaces. At the Boone gallery, for instance, entry was delayed for close to twenty minutes, the wait only somewhat eased by the fact that we were queuing in the Huntington’s superb gardens. Much of the experience at both venues consisted of being corralled into and out of rooms as others emptied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rhetoric around the biennial also conveys delay, where Covid-19 restrictions meant the show was postponed a full year. Many of the pieces and accompanying explanatory texts seem to be excusing the inability to show the work as fully intended. The inclusion of “a version” in the title even seems like a preemptive attempt to make amends for any shortcomings. In <em>deader than dead</em> (2020) by Ligia Lewis, a heavily trampled yellow pad is the only indication of an intended performance. While a video of the work can be viewed on the Hammer’s website, it does make you wonder: at what point should the Hammer have decided this display was impossible?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inability to experience a work fully is also evident in Nicola L.’s <em>La Chambre en Fourrure</em>, (“The Fur Room”) (1969/2020) which intended for visitors to insert themselves into a violet, acrylic fur structure. In this case, seeing is vastly different from experiencing. Six of the late artist’s sack-like suits, first conceived in the 1960s, entitled, <em>Pénétrables,</em> are also displayed at the Huntington. Nicola L. is a peculiar addition since the artist only lived in the city for eighteen months before she died in 2019, having spent the majority of her expansive career in New York City. It is a curatorial stretch to suggest that art first conceived in 1960s New York is representative of current work being made in Los Angeles.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite our inability to engage with them, Nicola L.’s works stand out. Several other works, however, seemed to fight for attention. For instance, the Boone gallery’s cacophony of competing videos at the Huntington meant viewing any work was muddied by adjacent audio. And when works weren’t vying for attention, there was little dialogue between artists. This<strong> </strong>exemplifies the curation of the biennial where artist’s practices were paraded individually rather than brought together thematically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Described by one of the curators as a sort of “haunted house,” Sabrina Tarasoff’s <em>Beyond Baroque</em> is an ode to the historic Venice literary arts center and experimental venue, an acute reflection on Los Angeles’s experimental literary scene told via memorabilia and, as such, entirely fitting for an exhibition “made” in LA. Exclusive to the Huntington, <em>Beyond Baroque</em> is like an amusement park ride through the center’s history, told with concert ticket stubs and other ephemera related to the poetry workshops held there in the 1980s. It’s a story that deserves telling and to see it displayed in the more traditional Huntington space is one of the show’s most promising inclusions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another Los Angeles tale is unearthed in Monica Majoli’s archival display of the early gay lifestyle magazine <em>Blueboy</em>, and its relation to the recently restored Thomas Gainsborough painting of the same title, a prized jewel of the Huntington collection. The magazine’s inaugural cover was a spinoff of the original work. In the publication’s parody, our now brawny model draws back the knee breeches of his eighteenth-century attire to reveal muscular thighs. This institutional self-reflection corresponds with the layout of the exhibition, which seems to entwine itself around the collection, allowing visitors to float between the contemporary and more historical works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Made in L.A.</em>’s<em> </em>self-assigned objective, “what art can actually do in the face of a global catastrophe and crushing structural inequity,” is left, unsurprisingly, unfulfilled. Without the space or the desire to dig too deeply into such an amorphous question, it is perhaps more useful to discuss the potential future of <em>Made in L.A </em>now that it has expanded to other institutions.While these double exhibitions present a somewhat jumbled representation of the Los Angeles art scene over the last two years, the hodgepodge curation is nothing new. In fact it’s really only a continuation of the uninspired curation of previous <em>Made in L.A.</em>’s. At the moment, the program comes across like an undergraduate degree show—magpie-like and without much in the way of a continuous narrative. Let’s hope that its expansion to the Huntington may suggest a new life for<em> </em>the biennial in coming years.</p>

<p><strong>It’s worth starting</strong> off by saying that I’ve been part of the problem. I’ve moved to cities without any intention of staying. I’ve hopped from neighborhood to neighborhood without caring what impact my presence had there because, as far as I was concerned, my presence was temporary. I moved to Seattle, then New York, then San Francisco, chasing opportunity each time. I would know it was time to move on when I saw neighborhood staples being replaced by bland and sterilized chains. I only shun the label “gentrifier” because I wasn’t gentry. I didn’t bring the coffee shops and record stores, I didn’t bring much of anything really aside from a certain shade of anxiety that almost inevitably comes with something or someone new appearing on your street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, just because I didn’t personally swap out the type of snacks in the bodega doesn’t shift blame off of me, I was the one being catered to as I switched neighborhoods again and again in search of cheaper rent. That’s the one thing I always used to assuage my guilt: I was just moving to these places to avoid spending half of my income on a terrible apartment. Sure, I didn’t have much in common with the existing residents but what else was I supposed to do? I didn’t recognize at the time that this mindset of inevitability had been taken up by a substantial portion of my generation. We’re far from the first to dabble in affluent transience (we are largely the children of Yuppies after all) but we do seem to be perfecting the form to ever more deleterious effects. We are the locust class, rootless migrants in our own country.</p>

<p>Is it wrong for us to chase opportunities, to seek out our fulfillment in the location of our choosing? Almost certainly yes.

I recently put a couple hundred pounds of carbon into the atmosphere to end up in a place with cleaner air. Did I realize my own hypocrisy as it was happening? Of course not. It’s often only possible to see ourselves through reflection and in this instance it took the form of a funhouse mirror: watching on my phone as the true gentry escaped the pandemic on their yachts, waited out social unrest from their fallow country estates, and fled wildfires on private planes. If their crimes are worse than mine, it’s only due to my lack of means.</p>

<p>The locust class is stuck miming the behavior of the elite, affecting an aspirational cosmopolitanism in the process. In an earlier era the fortunes of the American bourgeoisie were anchored to a <em>place</em> and so they acted as civic boosters with their middle class counterparts following suit. One side created an opera house or a baseball team and the other became ardent fans. Whole books, <a href=""https://wwnorton.com/books/The-Revolt-of-the-Elites-and-the-Betrayal-of-Democracy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">good ones</a>, have been written on the factors that have divested American elites from their sense of civic responsibility but an undeniably outsized impact of this phenomenon is the diminishing loyalty that the middle class hold for their cities in turn. A few thousand wealthy people moving around may or may not cause any issues but a few million dislodged, merely affluent folks can become a tide.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> demographic term for the locust class is “Temporary Urbanists.” We’re folks who move to cities in our early 20s and leave by our early 30s, typically heading to calmer parts of the same metro area (read suburbs), smaller cities or towns, and almost never back to where we came from. That there are millions of us (<a href=""https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/cfed-district-data-briefs/cfddb-20210205-did-the-covid-19-pandemic-cause-an-urban-exodus.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">3.6 million at any given time according to economist Stephen D. Whitaker of the Federal Reserve Bank</a>) comes as no surprise because we’re so highly visible. Filling cafes, spilling out of bars, piling into Ubers, and loudly complaining about local customs, we are the antithesis of what the term “Urbanist” has traditionally meant: an expert of and advocate for cities. Members of the locust class don’t stay long enough to cultivate expertise and only advocate for cities after they’ve left, hoping that the consumable parts are clean and frictionless should they ever want to visit. We are long-form tourists role-playing as city dwellers. The recent tragicomedy has been city governments falling over themselves to attract us and the corporations that employ us. While we add to the tax base during our stay, the presence of so many untethered people can’t help but loosen the social fabric. Unfortunately, the issue isn’t as simple as addressing the lack of attachment to our new homes. We also have to understand the missing connection to wherever we started out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I inherited this lifestyle. I sound like I’m shifting blame again but searching for the causes of your bad behavior usually does. My parents didn’t raise me anywhere near where they grew up and neither did their parents. As complicated and uniquely tangential as the stories of my recent ancestors may be, the bullet points (The Great Depression, The New Deal, World War II, suburbanization) are all narratively familiar to us as the forces that created and mobilized the American middle class in the 20th century. Mobilized being the operative word. Between 1940 and 1947 alone almost a quarter of the US population switched counties or states at least once. This wasn’t a nationwide game of musical chairs though. Tens of millions were leaving small communities and flooding cities as indicated by the fact that, according to census data, 40% of the country lived in urban areas at the start of the century compared to 80% at the end. Entirely new urban areas were being created since existing cities could only expand to accomodate so many.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>I think it’s this misunderstanding that defines the locust class: That the things that make a city, or any living space, good are meant to be consumed rather than produced.

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then as now, this was largely attributed to people seeking economic gains. Shifting industry and restrictive immigration policies forced wages up so drastically that in 1949 an uneducated male worker from the rural South could expect to earn 30-70% more by relocating to a city. Can we really blame people for moving when it meant the difference between poverty and stability? Or to put it another way, who would you be willing to crowd out for a 70% wage increase? This conflation of geographic mobility with social and economic achievement appears as a dark and near constant American throughline back to the colonial period. To find your fortune you had to go elsewhere and it didn’t particularly matter who was there before you. But what kind of fortune are we trying to find?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Money may explain the initial drive toward American urbanization but it isn’t the only motive of the locust class. While cheap rents shuffled me around within cities, it wasn’t increased wages that drew me to them in the first place. I probably could have gotten a fine job in my hometown (a small city at 250,000 inhabitants) along with a significantly lower cost of living. It was the amorphous and ever-alluring promise of “opportunity” that I fell for—the idea that cities contained some sort of limitless source of culture, savvy, and authenticity that you could consume in order to attain a higher state of being rather than having to produce it yourself. More than any other thing, I think it’s this misunderstanding that defines the locust class: That the things that make a city, or any living space, good are meant to be consumed rather than produced. Taken from rather than given to. It’s an extractive and unsustainable logic at the personal level that’s creating unlivably homogenous cities when brought to scale. I’ve watched neighborhoods transform around me, almost seeming to fit my image, but without my having had an active hand in it. The outcome chased me away again and again. Why? Because when we’re catered to, we aren’t given a chance to find what it is that we really want, we just get greater efficiency and “good enough.” We don’t end up with a stake in the outcome and without that tether, we just move on to the next place that has some character left to absorb. And it seems like we may be running out of those places.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A</strong> nauseating amount has been written about the death of cities as a result of the pandemic. Whether citing the proliferation of remote work or hygienic concerns, it seems that people can’t wait to toll the bell and proclaim that urban areas are emptying. Cities may very well die but it won’t be from people leaving in 2020. For every article or anecdote about booming ski towns or U-Haul rental rates there’s a counterexample with hard numbers. The Consumer Credit Panel and the United States Postal Service have both produced huge data sets showing a mostly normal outflow of people from major american cities, not a frantic mass exodus. What they also show though is a significant drop in the number of newcomers especially among (you guessed it) well-off young adults. Since last March there has been measurable reluctance on their part to relocate to cities. I doubt it’s much more than a blip and I’d be embellishing to call it the end of the locust class, but why shouldn’t it be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all, the locust class isn't so much a group of individuals, as much as it is an extractive mindset. A temporary interruption of the cycle can force people to consider why they wanted to move in the first place. I’m left thinking that people with the means to move comfortably shouldn't move at all, and people forced into migration should be afforded hospitality. It can’t possibly be as simple as that, yet moral suasion could go a long way. Where’s the threshold of acceptability? Are social or economic opportunity reason enough to move? And more importantly, what responsibility do we have toward wherever we end up? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For my part I’ve decided to just stay put. I was sick of living in rootless cities with rootless people, a situation that made San Francisco nearly unbearable until I realized my own solution. I couldn’t seek out genuine and authentic places to land when this one ran dry because the very act of ending up there would have made them disappear. I had to recognize <em>where</em> I was for <em>what</em> it was and see how I fit in, as a participant rather than a colonizer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>THOUGH DEVOTED TO LITERATURE</strong>, music, and art, George Abravanel believed, perhaps subconsciously, that intellectual accomplishments of the highest order were bound in America to meet with failure and disdain. One manifestation of this fatalistic outlook was his fierce admiration for American writer Maurice Nachman. Despite regularly finding Nachman’s books in the bargain bin at his local Barnes &amp; Noble, George never once thought that his hero’s career might be in jeopardy; might, indeed, be over... for George had long ago conferred upon himself a personal princedom of discernment and decided that what he thought was good was good; and what he thought was bad was bad—no matter what anybody said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bilingual from birth, George Abravanel spoke and wrote idiomatic French and English, a fact he thought defined him. Many people who knew him thought so, too. <em>Never forget</em>, his friend Fleming Dixon had once told him, <em>you’ve got two heads; I’ve only got one</em>. In the early aughts George lived in Paris with his girlfriend Eva, and worked as a freelance translator. He also ran, with a French friend, a literary magazine called <em>Episodia</em>, while dreaming, as one does, of becoming the best writer of his generation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George Abravanel read with the hungry rage of a forest blaze. Sometimes he thought himself destined for greatness; other times he knew he was doomed. He met William Gass, drank beer in his kitchen. William Burroughs generously inscribed and signed a book for him, as did Shelby Foote. But the person George wanted to write like was Maurice Nachman: he wanted to be darkly passionate and sexy (and sensitive and funny) like Maurice Nachman; he dreamt of meeting Nachman. A few months later, in San Francisco, his dream came true.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Call me Maury, Nachman said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nachman was charming; New York accent, pushing seventy, with a full head of salt and pepper hair, he had a glint in his eye, a dimple in his chin and an easy, infectious smile. It was evident, George thought, that Nachman had had many female entanglements.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They had lunch in a Chinese restaurant off Clay Street. They told Jewish jokes. Then, while eating shrimp dumplings doused in hot sauce Nachman told George about a couple he had observed the night before in a bar in Berkeley: a Black man and a white woman... George was mesmerized by the tone and unadulterated style coming out of Nachman’s mouth, the rollicking rhythm, each word calibrated for precision.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nearing the close of the story Nachman leaned in and whispered, eyebrows arched for emphasis,<em> And suddenly I knew: he’s paying her!</em> (A few months later George would read in a well-known West Coast literary journal another version of the story Nachman had told him, furthering his delight at having been allowed a backstage peek at literary magic in the making.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Nachman was signing George’s copy of <em>To Feel These Things</em>, George was dumbfounded when his hero looked him in the eye and said, apparently in all seriousness:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My style, it’s like nobody else’s!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A decade earlier, recognizing in <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em> a thinly veiled portrait of his own father, George—delusions of literary grandeur already in full bloom—had declared himself the Son of Portnoy. Nowadays George looked down on Philip Roth and raised a glass every October to his erstwhile hero on the occasion of his not winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, knowing how deeply this hurt the horny old turtle.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He imagined Phil staring at himself in his writing room in Connecticut, saying:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mirror mirror on the wall, who is George Abravanel’s undisputed Jewish-American heavyweight champion of English prose?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the mirror answering:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maurice Nachman... ruining yet another of Phil’s waning days...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever George visited the United States he always went to see his parents in eastern North Carolina, where George had grown up and whence he had fled at twenty. Naturally, during these visits George would go to the three or four places in eastern North Carolina where books were to be had, including Barnes &amp; Noble, and where his pessimistic view of American taste was again and again borne out. For it wasn’t just Maurice Nachman whose books George found in bargain bins there, but <em>the letters of Charles Ives, for God’s sake! And the letters of Delmore Schwartz and James Laughlin! A huge biography of John Cheever! And ten Nabokov novels in Vintage Contemporaries at a buck-fifty a pop! Aaaaaaarrrrghhh!</em> George thought, gleeful yet bitter as he walked the aisles of Barnes &amp; Noble with his book-filled wire basket.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George tried and tried and tried and tried, as one does, to write his immortal opus. But he was not as yet possessed of the perseverance, stamina, and distance necessary to go where his instinct wanted him to go and all his efforts ended up crumpled and thrown on the floor, his cat Buddy (<em>a mongrel, like me</em>, George liked to quip) delightedly batting the paper balls of lifeless prose around the apartment. Yet George was literary for life; he had a good ear and was in love with writing; so he decided to become a literary translator. In France, unlike in America and the rest of the English-speaking world, countless literary books were published yearly in translation, quite often from English, and even for a college dropout like him there was work to be had.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were a few famous translators in Paris—inasmuch as a translator is ever famous— including Marvin Mucho whose pen-name was, modestly, Mucho; Augustin Philippe, premier atomizer of the atmosphere; and broad-shouldered Benoît Le Bretonneux, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Clark Kent about to slip into a telephone booth. The three of them regularly lent their written French voices to Saul Bellow, William Vollmann, David Foster Wallace, William Gaddis, Toni Morrison and Donna Tartt, and all were pleased to offer selections of their translations in progress to <em>Episodia</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together with his co-editor, George translated short stories and letters and essays by Bukowski, Beckett, and Burroughs, and feedback was enthusiastic. The five issues they brought out in three years had a semi-fanatical though (naturally) restrained readership...&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>... and now that they had a foothold no matter how tenuous in the Paris literary world, George and his co-editor were in touch with hip young editors only too happy to grant them pre-publication rights to extracts and attend their launch parties, raucous sodden affairs in a café in the 5th <em>arrondissement</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon George was given a shot at translating a book from English into French, a first novel. For a big publishing house. He breathed a sigh of relief. He was in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through Nachman, George met Fleming Dixon in New York. Fleming was a brainy, handsome fellow around George’s age (early thirties) with, according to Nachman, great insight and flair and who was embarking on a brilliant career as literary critic and essayist. Of perhaps less than average height and with a gleaming, shaved head, Fleming Dixon had the ripped, stocky physique of a weightlifter; a coiled, tense energy emanated from his body, and he moved and comported himself with elegance and self-confidence. In a bar on the Lower East Side, Fleming, who translated French literature into English, queried George about his bilingualism. George told him about having French beaten into him by an idealistic French university teacher mother in eastern North Carolina married to a Chicago Portnoy singer-actor running amok tumescent amid the horny shiksa coed hordes of the 1970s... George told a good story; Fleming and he laughed together and were soon fast friends. Fleming—whose new translation of Baudelaire had just come out in Everyman’s Classics, who had grown up on Central Park South and attended a raft of tony schools—was gracious enough to find George, his intellectual caveman stance and strong opinions and literary magazine, interesting. And, as George was fond of saying: <em>Nice is nice to me</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile Nachman began something of a comeback by publishing stories in the <em>New Yorker</em>; another of his young admirers, short story writer Ezra Densky, a Belarusian Jewish immigrant to Vancouver, also began publishing in the <em>New Yorker</em>, and soon had a contract with Knopf for his Nachman-inflected début collection, a deal brokered in part through Fleming’s influence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tell you, this guy’s got moxie! Nachman said to George on the phone from his new home in Milan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a bubbling momentum among Nachman’s young trio of followers, and when George published a Nachmanesque essay about his father in <em>Episodia</em> and sent it to Fleming it was almost unsurprising that Fleming flipped. He sent George an email saying that he was the bees’ knees, before adding: <em>Don’t go anywhere. I’m calling</em>. The phone rang. It was Fleming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listen, he said, mazel tov, that piece is such a winner.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My gosh, George stammered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write it in English. It’ll get published here, I guarantee it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You think?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fuckin’ A, pal. You’ve got twenty-five hundred words that rock, that make sense, that sing. Put together a fifty thousand-word memoir with what you’ve got and I promise you you’ll have all of New York publishing at your feet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Goddamn, Fleming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’re an even better writer than translator, George! Who’d a thunk it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, George for one. But here was a guy who had the clout to say such a thing aloud and if he meant it, perhaps George would now begin to live a real life—the life of a published, cherished writer, a landslide-of-the-heart-type writer—and not this ersatz waiting room poor translator life… George wrote the piece over in English, it was published in New York, and Nachman himself responded favorably to it. George felt like he had arrived—but where? He walked around glowing like a Jack-o’-lantern, inwardly emblazoned with Nachman’s approval.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few months later Fleming announced that he would be coming to France to put the finishing touches on his translation of <em>Molecular Straitjacket</em>, a novel by Pascal Moignon, a French author Fleming had translated twice before and whom he would be visiting in Bordeaux before coming to Paris. Published twenty years earlier, <em>Molecular Straitjacket</em> was considered the crowning triumph of Moignon’s career; it was a famous, almost talismanic book; Moignon was legendary in Paris literary circles and around two weeks before Fleming arrived George heard from a reliable source that the severely alcoholic Moignon had gone cold turkey and was, at present, quite sober... Ominous storm clouds on the horizon, thought George, ever attuned to the meteorology of addiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two days after arriving in France, Fleming called George from Bordeaux.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s going on? George said, surprised to be hearing from Fleming so soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will you be home this afternoon? Fleming asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. But...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll be in Paris at five...&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll tell you what happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Something happened? George said and smiled, their conversation sounding, he thought, like dialogue in a Nachman story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few hours later Fleming arrived looking crestfallen. He dropped his bags. George stood up. Soon Fleming was sobbing in George’s arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sit down, he said, sit down. Here, have a beer...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George was then subletting a sixth-floor walkup at République with Eva and Buddy the cat. A pea-green baby-grand piano filled half the bedroom. It belonged to the owner. Neither Eva nor George played; they used it as a kind of desk. The rent was low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming drained his beer; George set another before him and Fleming told him what had happened:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(...here it might be apt to point out that Fleming Dixon’s spoken French was very awkward and hesitant. He made basic grammatical mistakes and had trouble with idiomatic speech, meaning he had a hard time following a regular conversation in French. George had noticed that this made his friend uncomfortable, and he also saw him bristle at the French tendency to comment on one’s mistakes. A baker, cabbie, lawyer, or fishmonger might suddenly decide to give a total stranger—even an illustrious intellectual such as Fleming Dixon—a lecture on French syntax, diction, and pronunciation. Fleming’s position was: <em>I have not been to France nor spoken French in over five years. Give me a break</em>. George, on the other hand, found it odd that Fleming with his superiority complex and strenuously demanding intellectual stance should be so flippant about his spoken French and he himself also had occasion, reflexively, to correct him... George sensed that Fleming did not like the French in general, something George could understand, but he also appeared averse to the French language in particular, which George could absolutely <em>not</em> understand. Fleming had translated Baudelaire and Moignon into English; he was known in New York as a French specialist yet he was neither intimate with nor partial to the language, something the infamously monolingual Americans could not have been aware of...)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first work session in Bordeaux puzzled Fleming. Moignon was languid and downcast. Fleming took out his notebooks, sat down, fired up his computer. Moignon, his rheumy eye trained on Fleming, rasped:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m fifty-seven years old.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I know, Pascal, Fleming said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The writer gestured toward the next room where his daughter was playing, and added:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m tired. And I don’t want to have a five-year-old daughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well shit, Pascal, Fleming said. I mean...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m tired. And I don’t want to work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay. Maybe let’s call it a day?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming returned to his hotel and slept. The next day after a slow morning work session Moignon, his wife and daughter and Fleming went to lunch. In the restaurant Moignon sat sullenly smoking, not touching his food. Fleming tried to be pleasant, attempting small talk <em>en français</em>, but Moignon interrupted him:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How long did you say it took you to translate all of Baudelaire?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eighteen months.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you translated Baudelaire in eighteen months, I could translate Shakespeare in twelve, Moignon said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming was flabbergasted. Moignon knew no English whatsoever. They had worked together for years. Why the sudden hostility?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moignon began talking about<em> Molecular Straitjacket</em>. As he spoke he grew agitated. This book is my life! he shouted. Your translation’s got to be <em>exquisite</em> because it’s an <em>exquisite</em> book!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listen Pascal, Fleming said…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, <em>you listen</em>! Moignon was screaming now. THIS! BOOK! IS! MY! LIFE!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Red-faced, spittle flying from his mouth, Moignon emphasized each word by pounding the table with his fist. Forks jumped, glasses rattled. His wife whispered, trying to calm him; his daughter—the whole restaurant—gaped. Moignon took out his wallet and threw money on the table.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only I can decide who translates my work, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pascal, Fleming whimpered...Glaring at Fleming, Moignon slowly stubbed out his cigarette in his steak tartare. Then he got up, hissed: <em>I’m sure you know your way to the train station</em>, gathered his wife and daughter and strode out into the street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming wept. George consoled him as best he could. Fleming turned on his computer, erased the work he had already done on the Moignon translation, and sent an email to his publisher saying what had happened and vowing to return his advance and to never translate another word of Moignon. He told George he had given the hotel in Bordeaux his name and address so he would receive the refund—with which to cover heat, water, and food expenses during his stay with George and Eva.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming had bought a bag of tangerines on his way to the station in Bordeaux. George took one. A sticker on each tangerine read, in gold cursive lettering against a blue oval backdrop: <em>Exquise</em>—Exquisite.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you notice the sticker, George said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming shook his head, oblivious to irony.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George peeled the sticker off and stuck it in his diary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George packed a pipe and Fleming and he spent the afternoon chatting. George tried to attenuate his gloom by sharing stories of betrayal and treachery in French letters… in the late afternoon Fleming went for a walk. When Eva came home from work she and George went down to a café to watch a European Champions League soccer game. There they sat among scarred, leather-jacketed men shrouded in cigarette smoke, eating steaks and drinking beer. Fleming joined them for the second half. Having played goalie as a kid he was constantly surprised to see the goalies taking more steps in the goal area while holding the ball than he thought they were allowed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why are you so down on old Phil? Fleming asked George the next day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah, <em>Monsieur</em> Roth, you mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, <em>bien sûr</em>, Fleming said smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And George took apart Philip Roth because his novels weren’t the elemental works everybody (including Fleming) said they were. <em>The Human Stain</em> for example is just a blatant ploy for the Nobel, he said; all those books, the stack of them from the nineties reaching to today are just a gigantic Portnoy hard-on for the Nobel. It’s careerism in the worst way. That’s why I hate him. He sold his soul by attempting to become <em>something</em> when he already was <em>someone</em>. And because he’s such an unremitting macho pig. Like Woody Allen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh no, don’t drag poor Woody into this! Fleming said, wagging a raised index finger at George.&nbsp;None of this was so very serious, despite the manic glint in George’s eye. (George added regarding Phil Roth and by extension his dad: <em>Enough with the misogyny!Enough with the wounded pride and ego of ye clever Jewish boys! You’re handsome, you’re getting laid and on top of that we’re supposed to pity you?</em>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The thing about Philip Roth was that he <em>was</em> a prose master, a Jewish-American heavyweight. George always prefaced his takedowns of Roth with this observation. He can be outrageously funny; and he captured with panache and a vicious vitality the sexual and social liberation that overwhelmed certain young Jewish men like George’s dad and Phil R in 1950s and 60s America... and the Jewish neuroses... George was on intimate terms with Phil Roth’s anger because it was his dad’s anger—through the guise of Portnoy; and George had decided it was petty. As was his own. Would he ever stop schlepping it? This meddlesome inheritance. Either way, George noted that the super sensitive and very voluble Fleming had nothing at all to say about misogyny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But wait a minute, George said, to get back to what we were saying earlier, I can only conclude that the philosophical thought-rot generated by the Blanchot-Deleuze-Derrida-Barthes-Lacan-Foucault apparatchik-conglomerate is the refuge of the soulless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now George, Fleming said, smiling indulgently but piqued nonetheless, you’ve just declared war on the last thirty years of academia!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No I didn’t, George said. Proust did! You’ll recall that he rejected theoretical thought out of hand; as did Céline, who went so far as to call ideas vulgar!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I always knew there was an anti-Semite lurking in you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No but really, George said puffing pensively, don’t you think trying to express an idea with words is like trying to make wood out of lumber?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together the two young men bounded down the stairs to walk the gray Paris streets and pursue the fascinating avenues of discussion opened by their fertile minds. On several occasions when flustered Fleming called George Pascal; and George was unpleasantly surprised the next day when returning home after dinner at a friend’s, Fleming jostled Eva, grabbing her around the waist in a way both she and George found inappropriate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in New York a few weeks later, to thank George for his hospitality and moral support in Paris after the Moignon debacle, Fleming sent him a 1934 second edition of Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged English dictionary—the same edition Vladimir Nabokov had used. A wonderful gift, except George had to pay fifty euros in duty for it. Fleming then wrote to say he was preparing an article about Montaigne and needed to consult the text of the Pléiade—a deluxe Gallimard edition which cost seventy or eighty dollars and which he presently asked George to buy and send him. Fleming had just been awarded a fifty-thousand-dollar grant; George was broke; Fleming knew it yet he added: <em>I think that you were sent a check from that hotel where I stayed in Bordeaux which should cover some of the cost</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, remarked Eva, I guess you could say that Fleming giveth and Fleming taketh away... And George took the risk of appearing caddish by refusing on the grounds of poverty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, Fleming’s star kept rising. He was turning into<em> the</em> literary critic of the day, reviewing the most famous writers alive and gaining a reputation as fearless and unrelenting in his assault on bad or over-hyped writing. And yet, in the glossy pages of a celebrated magazine Fleming hyped Adrian Danzig’s <em>The Rectification</em>, a baggy book that <em>embodied</em> the over-hyped novel, George thought. Fleming wrote that it was <em>very good, scrupulous</em>, and <em>ambitious</em>, lukewarm words to be sure, but George was miffed that Fleming should use his pulpit to burnish Danzig’s colossally overblown reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Rectification</em>, Fleming wrote, was a novel of ideas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ugh! thought George. Ideas again! Feh!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few months later, when <em>The Rectification</em> won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction—Fleming again demonstrating his infallible ability to pick a winner—George took it in stride, since a culture dedicated to looking down its nose at its finest artists could hardly be expected not to lionize its most mediocre ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After weeks of complaining of abdominal pains and refusing to go to the doctor in Milan (not trusting Italian doctors), Nachman was rushed to the ICU with invasive cancer and never recovered. A few months after his death a famous independent Paris publisher bought French rights to Ezra Densky’s début story collection, <em>Tamara</em>. When Fleming called George to break the news, he added:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And you’re the French translator.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you know that? George asked.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I says so, Fleming said.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And sure enough, before long George got a call. Soon he had a contract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wow, your boy is quite the kingmaker! Eva said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George spent the summer translating <em>Tamara</em>. After turning the book into his publisher, he sent the title story to Fleming, who had asked to see it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few days later Fleming responded, saying he was very impressed—George’s French was so clean, elegant, tight, rich, and smart, his sense of sentence notable. <em>It is quite clear</em>, Fleming wrote, <em>that you have a talent for translation, and that you should not be digging ditches in Madagascar</em> (well thanks through the nose, George thought)—before serving up ten pages of notes and suggestions on the<em> first page </em>of the translation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>I am not attempting to trump, equal, or call into question your knowledge of and capacity for French prose</em>, Fleming cautioned. <em>There is no question as to who is the better writer in French. I do not deserve even to shine your shoes in that department. So please, when reading my French attempts, be forgiving of the grammatical impurities you will surely find there, but see to the point I am trying to make by rendering them at all...</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming then went on to lecture George about THE SENTENCE, and how he and Densky and Nachman of course had pondered THE SENTENCE and its ramifications and construction, why it should be the length it is within a given paragraph, Fleming helpfully added, and how its relationship to other sentences in the paragraph should be based on rhythm, content, and style… as if a perfectly wrought sentence made rainbow-colored sperm shoot out of Fleming’s penis, George thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thereupon Fleming took it upon himself to systematically rephrase, recast, and take apart every sentence of George’s translation. When there was a common term or expression Fleming wasn’t familiar with he demanded that George justify his use of it. Knots formed in George’s throat and chest as he looked at the ten pages of comments in which Fleming’s fundamental ignorance of French usage (and abusage) was manifest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have had occasion to view the Dixon-Abravanel correspondence, as well as the story and translation in question. And it is my personal opinion that Fleming no doubt had a valid point or two or three regarding whether or not and when one should break a long sentence up into two, and the subtleties of conveyed thought recalibrated... but I think that what (rightly) outraged George was Fleming’s blatant bad faith.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To Fleming’s arrogance George now opposed his own, tersely justifying his work.Fleming wrote back right away, his tone now haughty, saying he did not understand what was going on; he knew George was a proud man but the WORK was the important thing; he should be thankful to him for helping George improve his WORK… He said George sounded <em>evasive</em>, that he sounded <em>offended</em>. Fleming was shocked, as if doors to perception and intellectual exchanges had stupidly slammed shut because of George’s <em>pride</em>... as if Fleming were necessarily, unequivocally right to give George a masterclass on translation from English into French and George were necessarily, unequivocally wrong and guilty of unhealthy pride in finding Fleming’s behavior out of line in any way, shape or form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George’s last communication with Fleming was a curt, elegant, scathing note written in French, <em>my mother tongue</em>, George hastened to add, demonstrating that pride was indeed the sin of which he was guilty.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And so it came to pass that after writing to editors all over America praising George Abravanel to the skies, using words such as <em>immensely</em> <em>refined literary sensibility</em>, Fleming Dixon now contacted Ezra Densky’s agent deploring George Abravanel’s supposedly willful sabotage of Densky’s limpid prose... and began to tear George down everywhere to everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George started smoking again. He dreamt of Nachman. He cried in the street thinking of him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A week later George was summoned by the famously sadistic chief editor of Densky’s French publisher, a redhead in leather pants. George entered the building at nine-thirty Monday morning chewing tranquilizers. The editor received him in her office, the Eiffel Tower visible through her window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your translation stinks, she said to George.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh really? he said. Show me. Where?The editor had left the door of her office open so her assistants could hear and hopefully enjoy the performance. She threw the manuscript down on the table with a disdainful flick of the wrist. Unfortunately for you, a <em>French expert</em> looked at your translation, she, a Frenchwoman, said about an American whose command of French was mainly theoretical.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I... uh... George mouthed, his mind and tongue thick with tranquilizer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had a most unpleasant time on account of your negligence! You forgot <em>brown</em>! the editor shouted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown? George said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Brown</em> as in <em>brown</em> shoelace!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George got up and stumbled out of the woman’s office, her reproving voice echoing after him off the seventeenth-century staircase walls...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fleming wants to control everything, Eva said; you refused to let yourself be controlled by him so he decided to destroy the whole project.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And if possible my reputation, George added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George was afraid the publisher would somehow be forced to have the book retranslated, that he would have to return the advance (following the implacable logic of Fleming’s destructive path, Fleming having had to return his Moignon advance). But George’s translation was published with his name on it, he was paid the rest of his advance and in France, much like in the United States and elsewhere in the world, Densky’s book simply tanked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So for once Fleming did not accomplish what he had set out to accomplish. If I am not mistaken he and Ezra Densky are now both comfortably (if, one hopes, bitterly) ensconced in academe. As for George, he continues to this day to translate English-language literature into French with Eva, whom he married. He also scribbles a little.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ran into him last week, and asked him what he was up to.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just chasing my own tale, he said, slim cat that I am.</p>

963,"A Chat with Jill Manton","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">Ten days before California re-opened, I video chatted Jill Manton, the Director of the Public Art Trust for the city of San Francisco. Formally known across the city as one of the key women who shaped San Francisco’s public art history and informally known as one of its most revered fashion icons, I am honored to call Jill a dear friend and mentor of mine. We talked about her most recent projects, like the transformation of Treasure Island into a public art destination, as well as the legacy projects that made her—and SF—what they are today</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer""><strong>AG</strong>: Tell me about your trajectory at the San Francisco Arts Commission...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>JM</strong>: I started as an entry level curator. Over the years I made my way up to the top curatorial position. I became the Director of the Public Art Program, then Director of Programs, then Deputy Director for a brief time, and finally my current title as Director of the Public Art Trust. Along the way, I raised more than 70 million non-mandated dollars in hard dollars, grants, or services for the city.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first program I initiated was in the late 1980s, and was the precursor to “Art on Market.” I negotiated for a voluntary allocation of $400,000 from MUNI. Posters in the bus shelters, performances, image projections… my intent was to share artists’ work in the public realm and to acquaint artists with the public review process. Get them used to their work being reviewed by a committee of peers. Most importantly, it was to integrate art into the life of Market Street. We had Joanna Haigood and her dance group do an aerial performance. A colleague of mine at the time was the Deputy Director of the Port of San Francisco, and he gave us permission to do that. It always helps to have relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also helped create an enforcement mechanism for the city’s <a href=""https://www.sfartscommission.org/our-role-impact/programs/public-art"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">2% for art ordinance</a>, which ensures that two percent of the construction cost of civic projects be allocated for public art. In the old days, when I first started, projects would integrate art at the end of the project once it was already built, so we were left with few alternatives to integrate art, except to try to find a way to have it make sense in an already built environment. Now we have artists conceptualize their work from the beginning of the construction process. I thought—and still believe—that artists see the world in a different way. Their unique perceptions would enable us to achieve the notion of designing a public place as a work of art as opposed to bringing an art object to a public place.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aside from civic projects, I realized that there were millions of private dollars being generated every year for more visual art in downtown. But most of that money,&nbsp;if not all of it,&nbsp;was going to artists from out of the area. I created the Public Art Trust, but was told that I always need to give developers options, instead of telling them what to do. So basically it’s an optional program, and developers can contribute all or a portion of their <a href=""https://www.sfartscommission.org/our-role-impact/about-commission/policies-guidelines/public-art-trust-fact-sheet"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">1% for art funds to the Public Art Trust</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the late '80s, I hired an artist to develop an Arts Master Plan for the Embarcadero Roadway. Out of that, the Promenade Ribbon Project was conceived as a two mile zone of artwork. The artists who were selected were Vito Acconci, who was a brilliant genius, Barbara Stauffacher Solomon, and Stanley Saitowitz. They conceived of the ribbon as a two mile, five foot wide, long, linear sculpture that ended up being a synthesis of art, urban design and infrastructure. It relieved the project of the need to provide benches and bollards. It brought illumination to the promenade. It was a barrier between vehicles and pedestrians. The conceptual premise of it was to illustrate where the land met the sea. It conformed to the historic sea wall that was underneath the Bay. Because of the design of the original Embarcadero, many buildings separated the pedestrian and viewer from the Bay, and precluded pedestrians awareness that they were at the edge of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also initiated a temporary public art program in 2000, starting with a citywide Keith Haring exhibition of 10 of his sculptures.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What changes in public art have you seen over the years?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sea change in attitudes. When I started, I had to fight for public art. People would say <em>why do we need it? Whatever happened to statues of men on horses?</em> <em>Why not fight AIDS? Homelessness? Arts education in schools?</em> We couldn’t use capital money that was associated with bond projects for any of those programs. And nobody wanted public art anyway. People were afraid of controversy. Temporary public art laid the groundwork for public art. People didn’t have to commit to liking it. It made it easier for people to re-engage with their environment in a new and different way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the years, I’ve done a lot of temporary projects. I brought a Louise Bourgeois spider to the waterfront. And I want to give credit to Gavin Newsom, who as mayor was a big advocate of temporary public art. He started coming to all of my temporary public art dedications, and he made a speech saying that he wanted to see an abundance of temporary public art in the city. He cited <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid%27s_Span"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cupid’s Span by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Brugen</a>, commissioned by Don Fisher of the Gap. While he said he wasn’t a fan of that piece, he wanted so much public art in the city that people would be able to say they disliked one piece, but liked another.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also brought the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Heads_Six_Arms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Zhang Huan three-head six-armed buddha</a> to San Francisco’s Civic Center in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Shanghai-SF sister city. It was a hayday for temporary public art.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, when I started there were few women sculptors. It was a male dominated field. But over the decades I’ve seen many more.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Tell me a bit more about the Public Art Trust you started.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Again, I’d like to credit Gavin Newsom. In 2006 I was asked by the mayor’s office to look at the 1% for art in private development.&nbsp;Like I said, it’s an optional program, and developers can contribute all or a portion of their 1% for art funds to the Public Art Trust. It can be used for temporary public art projects at the development site or within a half mile of the particular zoning. It can also be used for conservation projects by the Arts Commission, and to commission permanent public artwork.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my models was the World Trade Center in New York. They had a vibrant public art program. I called for information about their public art program and there was a recording:&nbsp; <em>If you’re calling about our performing arts program press 1, if you’re calling about our evening film series, press 2, if you’re calling about our temporary exhibition program, press 3. </em>One of the&nbsp; purposes of this program was to make the World Trade Center a destination. Many offices go dark at the end of the day, and instead this program attracted hundreds and thousands of people. The wine bars and the sandwich shops in the vicinity benefited. I had hoped that we could do something like that with the Public Art Trust.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our first project is a permanent art project, funded by Emerald Fund,&nbsp; on the western facade of the Bill Graham Auditorium. We Commissioned Joseph Kosuth to make WFT, the World Family Tree.&nbsp; I always have to remind myself that it’s not WTF. It’s based on the world etymology of “civic” and “auditorium.” It’s elegant and educational… it’s transformed that street.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What is the public art program on Treasure Island?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read about the Navy transferring land to the city in 2005. I knew enough about zoning and 1% for art to know Treasure Island was not part of the C3 district, where 1% for art is required. So I went to see a colleague in the mayor’s office to ask if he could stipulate that there be a 1% for art written into the development agreement, and if the Arts Commission could manage those funds. Then, in a bigger, bolder, what-the-hell-I’ve-got-nothing-to-lose move, I went to the Executive Director of Treasure Island at the end of 2013 and I proposed that the 1% for art in private development be used exclusively to enhance public art and the public realm, and not be used for private property. To my absolute surprise and delight, it was approved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a couple of things I’ve learned in my career, Azule. Number 1, there is a very long pause between the idea and the reality, in city time. You have to be patient. I started this project in 2005 and we didn’t launch the <a href=""https://www.sfartscommission.org/content/treasure-island-arts-master-plan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Arts Master Plan</a> until 2017. Number 2, I’ve learned to always ask. If you don’t ask you don’t know. I learned that a lot of our city partners will say yes. I’d ask things like, Could you have your contractor pour the foundation for the sculpture?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also learned that Treasure Island was the largest allocation of public space since the Golden Gate Park. What better place to have a vibrant and robust art program? Treasure Island would be a destination for the arts. The Arts Master Plan that I wrote with the participation of the design team Included permanent artwork, temporary artwork, and all media. One of my goals, similar to the Public Art Trust, was to have artists benefit from private development. It’s such a different scale than public projects like recreation center. And not only is the idea of a program that includes performance and theater exciting, it’s just. And necessary. I wanted to allow artists in other media to benefit from the 1% for art programs. There will also be long term environmental art projects where artists can address unique conditions of Treasure Island like sea level rise and severe wind. The art program will be anchored by a series of large scale sculptures, the first of which is Hiroshi Sugimoto’s on Yerba Buena Island.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I made a discovery with the <a href=""https://sfrecpark.org/988/Patricias-Green-in-Hayes-Valley-Picnic-A"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Patricia’s Green</a> site. When I was recruiting artists, I realized,&nbsp;who has a 20 ft tall sculpture just lying around for public display? Who has the real estate? Who has the expensive equipment needed? There is a certain amount of privilege associated with that. So I opened up the application to allow artists to propose new works that they would build with part of the honorarium.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What's your favorite piece of art in the city?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wow. I really like the Olafur Eliasson (which is not part of the Arts Commission's efforts). I also really love the Keith Haring Sculpture at Moscone Center, which I was able to personally select for our citywide exhibit.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the challenges of public art, Azule, is that for many years, it was regarded as a bastard stepchild of the art world. But we’ve seen a change—and not just in San Francisco, but all over. Look at the New York Subway, or San Francisco Airport. There’s much less of the church and state divide between private and public art.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fine art had acclaim and support in the fine art world as well as with the general public. That’s always been a goal. We want public art to be loved by the general public, as well as have that credibility. Not all works achieve that, but Keith Haring’s does.

<p><strong>March 29th, 2021</strong>—Four weeks after my first dose of what <em>Hamilton</em>-loving centrists call a “Fauci Ouchie,” I’m en route to receive my second Moderna injection. Wanting to avoid the dysfunction of Los Angeles County’s Covid-19 vaccine distribution process, I opted to get my shot in Long Beach. Initially, people with disabilities under 65 and other high-risk groups weren’t listed in the first or second vaccination tiers—a gentle reminder that vulnerable populations be damned unless they can provide proof of economic contribution. A typical paradox, considering the disproportionate disability unemployment rate due to the glaring lack of accommodation and de facto discrimination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given my history of unconventional employment, I didn’t qualify for a vaccine, even though there was a strong likelihood I could suffer hospitalization or potentially more lethal consequences, should I get down with the sickness. “OOH-WAH-AH-AH-AH” would be my death knell as my lungs fill with fluid. Naturally, this impasse led me to dig through my records and attempt to salvage any pay stub remotely signifying acceptable productivity. Every once in a while, fate lets you be on the winning side of irony and I found an old contract from a local university that officially designated me an education worker for my guest lectures on disability and discrimination. Others like me weren’t so lucky, and instead had to continue with self-imposed house arrest until the powers that be allowed them to join the respectably documented in the queue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>California’s first round of Covid-19 vaccines were administered in December 2020. Understandably, these doses were given to frontline healthcare workers, with the elderly following right after. Susceptible populations would have to wait another three months before their tier got the green light—a delay that was heavily criticized by disability advocacy groups as the data clearly demonstrated that individuals with co-morbidities and preexisting conditions had higher mortality rates. But now that vaccines are open to most of the population, another one of my communities is experiencing low rates of vaccination, but for very different reasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the time of writing, Hispanic Californians are the least vaccinated demographic in the state. While 49% of non-Hispanic white Californians have received the vaccine, only 27% of those who self-identify as Hispanic have received theirs. I don’t have a complete understanding of why Hispanics are reluctant to get the vaccine, but my suspicions lead me to believe that at least part of the issue lies in the historic abuse of Hispanic populations by institutionalized medicine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em><strong>Mijo</strong></em>, don’t get the vaccine,” my father warned me in Spanish after I told him I had scheduled my first appointment. “It’s filled with the same pesticides they used to spray on Mexicans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being a salt-of-the-Earth Mexican whose main remedies consist of <em>VapoRubyEsprait</em>, my father was misinformed about the contents of the vaccines and sounded like José Rogan. However, he was correct about one thing:&nbsp;In 1917, there was an influx of Mexican migrants fleeing the Mexican Revolution. The El Paso mayor at the time, Thomas Calloway Lea Jr., deemed them to be “dirty lousy destitute Mexicans” and feared that they would bring diseases with them across the border. After using all his ACME brand contraptions and failing to control the armies of Speedy Gonzales, Lea threw his 10-gallon hat into the dusty tierra and comically stomped on it repeatedly in frustration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Oooh, I’m gonna get those lousy Mexicans!” Lea said, probably.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lea needed to think of another way to curtail the potential spread of unwanted contagions, both micro and macro. So in the name of public health, he ordered the pesticidal cleaning of all migrants and workers entering the United States from Mexico. As they crossed the border, immigrants were forced to strip off their clothing as their bodies were doused with flammable chemicals. Their clothes were fumigated with hydrocyanic acid, sold under the trade name “Zyklon B,” which would go on to be the gas of choice in Nazi death camps to murder millions that were also labeled “unclean.”</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Like many other multi-million dollar sports arenas, the construction of Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine is replete with more peccancies and asterisks than the home-run records of the early 2000s.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Often</strong> conspiratorial thinking among working class Hispanics is derided by elites as a distrust of the clinic caused by lack of education. While distrust of institutions is at the heart of any conspiracy, Hispanic suspicions toward white doctors in white lab coats is well founded. Generations of “disinfected” Mexicans and Chicanos in the United States have experienced numerous injustices committed in the name of “public good.” From the border gassings to the law and order rhetoric of Operation Wetback and subsequent deportation programs to eminent domain displacement, Hispanic people, have suffered in the name of progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Edifices constructed to serve the “public at large” (i.e. no abnormals or malcontents) on stolen land add insult to injury by excluding those who were harmed to make way for the future.&nbsp;Dodger Stadium in particular is a monumental example. Dodger Stadium’s significance within Los Angeles’s urban canvas can be interpreted several ways: For Chicano sports fans, it’s a cathedral sanctified by 56,000 blue-clad parishioners worshiping at the altar of St. Vincent Scully and St. Thomas Lasorda. But for those born before 1960, Dodger Stadium is a cold, concrete reminder of the deracination of <em>la</em> <em>raza</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like many other multi-million dollar sports arenas, the construction of Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine is replete with more peccancies and asterisks than the home-run records of the early 2000s. Home in the 1940s to three flourishing Mexican neighborhoods, Chavez Ravine was declared “blighted” in 1949, and a decade-long battle commenced in 1951 when the city proposed to use the land for public housing designed by well-known architects Richard Neutra and Robert Alexander. Eventually the city seized the land through a combination of eminent domain and underhanded real estate deals. Those who resisted were removed by force. As support for public housing waned during the anti-communist crusades of the 1950s, led by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, the land was offered to the Brooklyn Dodgers as incentive to relocate, which inevitably they did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On January 20th, 2021, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti claimed the vaccine hub at Dodger Stadium was the largest in the world after it delivered over 7,700 doses in a single day. Institutional malfeasance has come full circle within the span of a century as the circumstances of the stadium’s construction have come back to haunt the city. Chicano residents—potentially the great-grandparents of the city’s current population—survived gassings intended to make them clean enough to become Americans and were subsequently dispossessed of their homes in the Ravine. And now, the Chicanos of Los Angeles are asked to trust medical institutions at a facility built on the destruction of their own communities.</p>

<p><strong>I’m</strong> obviously sympathetic to the intergenerational trauma suffered by my father and others alike. The fears of being experimented on or exploited by the government are historically grounded. It seems like no matter whether you buy into medicine or try to distance yourself from it, death and negligence are unavoidable parts of existing as a hyphenated-American. Proportionally, Hispanic/Latino Covid-19 mortality rates in Los Angeles are almost triple that of White Angelenos. Per 100,000 White residents, 121 have died. Whereas per 100,000 Hispanic/Latino residents, 357 have died. Perhaps the most daunting aspect of all this is trying to convince my paranoid immigrant father that it isn’t the vaccine that puts his life at risk, or even the misinformation he’s received about it, but rather the historical trauma bestowed upon him that made him so susceptible to believing it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m old enough to remember the halcyon days of down-to-earth conspiracy theories like the ones promulgated by Sarah Palin and the Tea Party, long before QAnon showed sleepy, middle class Americans how baroque conspiracy theories could be. While protesting in our nation’s capital, the Tea Party and its ilk megaphoned that the Affordable Care Act would lead to panels overseeing who would live or die, as doctors with globalist grins decide whether or not your grandma is worth saving. “Keep your FEMA-death-camp-funding government paws off my insurance policy! You want us all dead!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Americans are much more comfortable supporting policies that lead to mass death than contending with their own individual mortality. It’s necropolitics 101: any accommodations needed to ensure the health of the public are viewed as necrotizing agents, hell-bent on eroding the rights of individuals or, as they’re more aptly known, the operations of big business. The free market they champion is the true death panel.</p>

<p>I pulled up to one of the kiosks at the Long Beach Convention Center (now sheltering hundreds of migrant children, some of whom have contracted Covid-19 while there) and I presented my bare arm to a PPE-clad nurse and received my publicly funded prick. As I waited inside my car for 15 minutes to make sure the microchip inside the vaccine booted up properly, I wondered if people in my communities would follow suit or if it would indeed be “White Boy Summer.”</p>

<p><strong>In 1949, E. B. White</strong>, the shy author of <em>Stuart Little</em>, dared to imagine a sudden, violent disaster befalling New York. In his classic essay, “Here is New York,” he pictured airplanes swooping overhead, then diving into buildings, subways, bridges. Picturing New York’s demise has always been a macabre hobby for New Yorkers—a perverse form of affection, perhaps. The urban imagination skews dark: The inconceivable (yet all-too-conceivable) end of ordinary life, and the likely aftermath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If White were alive, he might marvel at New York’s resilience following the very different airborne disaster of 2020–’21. Earlier this year, as Covid-19 restrictions eased, New York entered a strange, hopeful phase of recovery. Call it pre- post-pandemic. The city was, and remains, in limbo: half open, half closed; half excited, half anxious. If the acute anxiety has passed, a more general, low-grade apprehension fills the vacuum. What will resume, when life resumes? Will the new normal resemble the old normal? Who, if anyone, decides?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If anything, the questions underscore how deeply unreal the pandemic felt even as it unfolded. It began with grocery stores ransacked—New Yorkers calmly panicking. A run on high-calorie staples, plus new necessities—Purell and Clorox wipes. A few weeks later—around the time provisions started dwindling—came the great exodus, certain wealthy zip codes emptying out. It was possible to picture a great convoy: Money leaving town.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, really, who could resent anyone’s safety? In Central Park, the pastoral East Meadow became a field hospital, yellow Hazmat suits patrolling green walkways. New York’s stoicism—always a bit of a ruse—was replaced with a frank admission that, though we’re prepared for anything, there are exceptions, including huge, sudden disruptions to normal life. Single people suffered severe solitude. Families suddenly marooned together suffered equally daunting tests. New relationships reached an inflection point: cohabit or call it quits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Time stretched in weird ways. Hours distended. Weeks blurred into weekends. The long days acquired a lulling sameness. It was less a matter of change than diminution: Less to do, fewer people to do it with. Less money, fewer things to spend it on. And fewer outlets for energy. New York—the world capital of deranged ambition—became the world capital of difficult adjustments. Without all-consuming jobs, some type-A personalities came unanchored. Midlife crises arrived early.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The eeriest changes went unappreciated. The lifeblood of New York, its subway, emptied except for essential workers. Grand Central Terminal, where movement in any direction takes skill and proprioception, lest you get caught in the cross-stream of tourists and commuters, sat eerily quiet. Wandering empty blocks, you could indulge the timeless fantasy that an extinction-type disaster had taken place, yourself the only survivor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In normal times, competition for space extended even to Central Park, whose running paths resemble <em>Ben Hur</em> at peak hours. Now, red signs enjoined runners to stay THIS FAR APART. Generally, runners obeyed, while rudely flouting mask rules, making every wheeze and gasp an aggressively antisocial act. A lifelong runner, I sided with the mask-wearing non-runners. So much for thoughtfulness, I thought. Yet their rudeness was oddly reassuring: it was still New York, a place to be affronted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>For</strong> a blissful moment that lasted months, a sense of unity and common struggle prevailed. Every evening, at 7pm sharp, the cheering began, noise swelling the canyons of Broadway and Madison Avenue. For several jubilant minutes, human noises replaced wailing ambulance sirens. With that, the ambient dread, the sense that a very thin line separates safety from absolute hell—dire illness, an overcrowded emergency room—receded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, mercifully, life, or something like it, began again. In July, by state ruling, construction resumed, the drone of jackhammering now a soothing sign of normalcy. (“New York is Getting Loud Again,” a headline noted.) Soon, the familiar din of traffic and car horns returned; the old impatience, frustration, aggression. And stubborn optimism. Hope came via the unlikely savior of Big Pharma, proof, again, that everything was topsy-turvy. Conversations veered toward vaccines. You could almost hear it: a long, collective exhale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A new, uncomfortable question arose: Could the pandemic improve New York? In her remarkable book, <em>A Paradise Built in Hell</em>, Rebecca Solnit describes the upside of disaster: spontaneous altruism, cooperation, and cohesion; the strengthening of civic and neighborly bonds. When an old order is upended, a new, better order is possible, and in the flush of optimism, one can imagine a new sort of mindfulness—a deeper sense of life’s precariousness, of the interconnectedness of citizens. New Yorkers, it is said, are good in a crisis, not-so-good the rest of the time. Could unity and solidarity be woven into the City’s new fabric?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or perhaps simple humility. During the pandemic, you could love New York, but it was hard to feel boosterish about it. John Updike’s famous quip, “The true New Yorker secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be, in some sense, kidding,” made little sense. New York, center of the planet? Nah. Not anymore. Could a saner, humbler city emerge? While I’m dreaming, could the tyranny of offices and commuting erode? (“It’s Time to Do Away with Rush Hour,” a headline pleaded.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Other</strong> changes seem more probable thanks to the pandemic. In a city that fetishizes progress and change, it exposed a secret longing for permanence, rooted in common experience. You arrived here; you formed attachments; you watched forlornly as everything changed. Sixty years ago, the writer Ben Hecht described “The ancient human trick of identifying disaster as progress; of forgetting beauty when it dies and accepting rubbish in its stead.” Hecht’s nightmare, a city of soulless conveniences, is increasingly our reality, as eccentrically human places are replaced by drab chains and cookie-cutter McStores. Nothing new there, though. In many ways, the pandemic simply accelerated the homogenization that began under the neoliberal dispensation of Giuliani–Bloomberg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, what happens next? In early June, New York’s vaccination rate hit 55 percent. You can fight for space on the subways again. Major libraries are reopening, with a Vesuvian feel to them, everything frozen, as if time itself stopped in March 2020. But of course, nothing actually stops. The essence of New York—its crazy dynamism, what Janet Malcolm calls its “anarchic, unaccommodating spirit, its fundamental irrepressible aimlessness and heedlessness”—will certainly survive. New York’s famed callousness—“you could be frozen to death in the midst of a busy street and nobody would notice,” Bob Dylan once wrote—should make a comeback too. The return of normal urban anxiety (“there is neurosis in the air which the inhabitants mistake for energy,” Waugh wrote in <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>) will be almost welcome when it returns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Picturing New York’s demise—a luxury of normal times—may again feature in Hollywood movies (screened in reopened theaters). Of all the fantasy-predictions, a humble, chastened New York seems both desirable and semi-plausible. “The intimation of mortality is part of New York now,” E. B. White wrote. A new humility would fit the zeitgeist. Hierarchies are being assailed; notions of greatness—white, male, etc.—are deeply unpopular. Will the notion of Great Cities suffer the same leveling?</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">California may have been barrelling toward the all-clear in late May when this interview was conducted, but traffic in Los Angeles is still traffic in Los Angeles. So with Paris in Berkeley, Marius in Los Angeles, and Lynell in Pasadena, an old-fashioned video call took place where the trio covered an array of topics including the responsibilities inherent in conducting a posthumous interview, writing about Los Angeles and the memory of place, and Lynell’s L.A. reading list. This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM</strong>: Let’s start with your latest. What drew you most to Octavia Butler, as a subject for a book?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>LG</strong>: It was really not my intention to do a book when I entered the archive to work on Butler. It was to work on a commissioned piece for <a href=""https://clockshopla.tumblr.com/post/172599261083/pre-order-is-now-available-for-our-new-140-page"">Clockshop</a>, which is an arts nonprofit here in Los Angeles, in Frogtown. I was approached by the executive director Julia Meltzer and she wanted to know if I would be up for creating something that she framed as a posthumous interview and I thought that would be interesting. I didn't know what that would look like, or feel like, but I was open to taking a trip through the archive of course, because, you know, who wouldn't be? And once I got in there I was just amazed. I mean the size of it, the sort of objects that Butler saved really spoke to me. So after I was finished with that piece I realized there was more that I wanted to do. And I think it was based on this very familiar struggle that she was having as a Black woman trying to become a writer in Southern California. You don't see that story very often, her road was so unusual. She did <em>so </em>much on her own, and that’s what drew me, how she was able to construct this extremely grand yet unusual life with very humble objects, that's what stuck with me, and that's what made me decide to want to write about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Unlike the traditional biography, or collected journals, or letters, this one was very much about letting her speak through her journals and interpreting just a little bit. What was it like deciding to create this living catalog?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I really did let the archive lead me. First, when I started I was thinking it would be a book specifically about writing, you know, the struggle of that. But I kept bumping into these objects and the things that she would reach for during the day. After spending about a couple of years in the archive, I really started to look at, where did she spend most of her time? And I really meant, you know, physically, in her writing life.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were certain kinds of journals she used to work out her emotional issues—her frustrations, her shyness, her slowness, as she called it, but that was her process.Then her calendars, and then other notebooks, and once I started to look at those things and the things that she reached for I thought: Okay, what are the most essential things? What are the things that she's looking at every day? She's looking at her bills every day to try to make sure, Do I have enough to make sure everything keeps running? Then the calendar she used in so many different ways. She was looking at deadlines, and so many writers are always looking at our deadlines, so part of you is here in the present, but also you're planning for the future. But she also used it to track her progress. So you'll find page numbers, you know, how many pages she wrote on a particular day. So I started to be able to get a real sense of her world through these objects like library cards, because the library was both her office and her palace. And so I thought, how do I tell her story through these objects, these particular objects, because I knew I would be limited in number per the Estate’s permissions. Once I narrowed things down it became really clear that I could tell an arc of her writing life through these particular objects, and that was the key.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Well, it was very moving. And when you specifically bring up the bills and the living in the future, it really makes everything so much more poignant and so much more intimate. One of the most powerful things we took from the book was that she seemed to want desperately to reach people on a level beyond color… to be nothing more or less than a good storyteller. There is that powerful line, “Being a dancing bear may get me through the door, but for me, only being a fine storyteller will stave off the hook.” Where do you think her<em> </em>desire stands in relation to this moment in time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From being in the archive I think the, “I want to be looked at as a storyteller, a fine storyteller, a strong storyteller,” is rooted in this dismissal of her as a Black person, period. And that was always on her mind and she always talked about what it was like to not see herself in the world, in the world of movies, in the world of TV, in the world of fiction and to not feel empowered. I write about women, and I write about power and Black women, because I had none. And so I think, absolutely she would be dead center of this if she were around because she was looking for a community to go back to. She wanted to feel understood, and she was constantly fighting to be respected. She knew how she was being minimized or diminished in certain ways and that was a huge fight for her, and it did have to do with color. So, in a way, it is “See me as I am, as a whole person, regardless of race.” But the race part was important. Her work is centered around Black people, and much of it is, you know, “Stop putting me in a box” and this thinking, “We'll see you in Black History Month.” That's the dancing bear part. But in a lot of interviews, she's trying to reframe people by saying, “I'm a writer, and my characters happen to be Black.” But that's a larger discussion. She's trying to push off boundaries because she needs room. But at the same time she's not walking away from her Blackness.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Reading <em>A Handful of Earth, </em>a lot of it is Octavia walking around her neighborhood. In <em>After/Image</em> you talk a lot about walking around Los Angeles. How do you use walking and observing around the city as a form of place-keeping?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For me it was a way of seeing the city. It <em>is</em> a way, not was—Covid makes it feel like it was. But it slows the city down, you can actually see it. We're so often in our cars and, for me as a reporter, I'm “covering the whole city,” so I'm seeing things in a blur, and not really seeing what's happening on the ground and who is where and what is changing. If you get out of your car and you're walking through the neighborhoods, you see them more vividly and you can see the changes, in a stop motion kind of way, and interact with people. There are certain places in LA where people are only on foot or taking buses and don't rely on cars. And some of it is a class issue too. And so to me it's essential because if you want to really see the layers of Los Angeles, you have to get out of your car, you just have to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Octavia, who never drove, she always relied on the bus, even for her writing. I think it's in “Speech Sounds,” there's a fight on the bus and it starts with that and that's straight out of her journals. There's some really rich writing about who's on the bus and what happens on the bus and the chaos of the bus, and she's listening to conversations. That stuff seeps in. There's so much isolation in LA because you're in your car driving from one cube to the next cube to the third cube. Being on the bus, being around people all day long, she got ideas this way for all kinds of things—essays and op-eds and ideas for her books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walking was her inspiration as well. It was walking around and looking at the nature around her, and how nature changed, and climate, and what was growing and what was not growing and what got cut down. She was looking at change in a different way and looking at the community in a different way. I see that show up in the backdrop of <em>Parable of the Sower</em>, in <em>Kindred</em>, which is set in Altadena, Pasadena, in <em>Mind of my Mind</em>. She was a person who drew maps and because she was on foot—she never drove—her maps look different from the maps of people who are in their cars. You've got the trees and the bushes and, you know, the details.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In your book <em>After/Image, </em>how does the concept of hauntology figure in the city—specifically LA? Who and what are the ghosts here? And how can we conjure the past they represent?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think the thing that I'm seeing in a lot of cities is there's so little respect for the past. It might be changing now because of something they just did here in the mayor's office. Christopher Hawthorne, who used to be the [<em>LA Times</em>] architecture critic, is now working for the city and this committee called&nbsp;Past Due. One of the things [the Los Angeles Mayor's Office Civic Memory Working Group] has been wrestling with is, how do you honor the past, and how do you honor those stories? We can talk about gentrification, which is such a triggering word—people either turn off and they don’t want to hear it, “Oh, city’s change all the time…” but this is different because it feels much more aggressive and it washes away the things, the history. And then the people on top have a lack of curiosity about what they are standing on, and the layers that are beneath it. I think in order to conjure those ghosts, you have to summon them. And you have to ask questions about what is there, and why it's there, and why this place looks the way it does, and what we honor. I don't think we often leave enough space for that to happen, because people are just intent on turning these places that are historic into something that's just comfortable for them. “It’s my blank slate and I'm just going to build what I want to on it, and it doesn't really matter about whoever's around me.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">To correct that, some cities do something like a plaque. How do you feel about the plaques or these kinds of monuments to local history?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a complex feeling about those. I mean acknowledging is one thing. But I think it's this business about statues and plaques but is that enough? I think it has to be something that's part of a living space where the person who's moving through it is prompted to ask questions and it's part of an interpretive space. It's not this passive plaque that’s up there, it should be more, you hear the voices or you see the faces.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was this really beautiful description in a magazine article I was reading—I can't remember the source—but what sticks with me is the description. It was about The National Memorial for Peace and Justice and the description of the grounds. There is a path that's shaped like a clock that is supposed to represent the time the memorial covers, from the transatlantic slave trade through the present. It is a memorial to the victims of lynchings. The detail that remains with me is that as you enter, you read the names and dates and they are eye level in the beginning. But by the end, your perspective shifts, because you're walking on an incline, and the monuments are now ""hanging"" above you. A powerful re-interpretation. It was profound… So that's what we're headed toward: a more active way of being able to understand what that history means and what it feels like.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In “Between Here and There,” you write about the loss of [local restaurant] Cha Cha Cha and other important cultural gathering places. In the section on gentrification, “Here comes the neighborhood” (which feels like it really should be <em>the</em> text on the subject), you quote Peter Moskowitz, “We are being taught to consume a city, not experience it like a community.” What stands between today and a future where we can begin to really invest in our communities again, where idiosyncratic establishments full of color and character—integral parts of vibrant communities—can survive this “short-term everything” “take-take-take” onslaught?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know I wish I knew. I really had, I won't say high hopes, but after Covid I thought maybe there would be some kind of reckoning—we had so much loss in this last year and change—that we would come out of this with a different mindset, with gratitude and curiosity back. I watched my neighborhood, I walked my neighborhood a lot, during our lockdown it was full of beautiful gestures of people clearing their fruit trees and putting boxes of fruit and avocados out on the street for people to take, and bags for them to carry them, and toys, free toys, free clothes, free food banks and I thought, “Oh maybe this is going to open the heart more and we will be a close knit community after this is over.” Or we may revert back to where it was, like we just hit pause. And now we have all these places that are open, and all these businesses that have remained closed. What's going to go into those businesses and how do we help people get started again? Because a place like Cha Cha Cha, that's organic. They got in when it was low rent and they were able to stay for all those decades because it was family owned and family run. And you know, all the people that lived there even once and moved away, they came back because it was a touchstone.</p>

<p>It would take a huge commitment to really re-invest in our cities again. I don't know if it's tax breaks or some kind of incentive to pull people in and let them work to try to build something. When something is artificial, you don't go back to that, that's not something that becomes part of you. As you were talking about, this whole tech sector, when they're in a place they're not really in a place anyway because they're conducting business elsewhere. But that's the thing, I feel like there needs to be some sort of support, where the people who actually grew up in the soil and have this memory of place are trying to preserve what neighborhood really means. Otherwise it's just generic. But when it's not sustainable and it gets bulldozed over and then written over and we do something again, we get a bland box.</p>

<p>This woman I met many years ago, she worked at UCLA and she used to do these tours for new students coming into Los Angeles and she would take them out to places that were beyond the guidebook. And she came to one of my readings for <em>After/Image</em>, and we got into this discussion during the Q&amp;A session. When I lived in Echo Park, I used to hop in my car and go to Venice, and Venice used to feel extremely different from Echo Park, or Inglewood, or Downtown, or Westchester, or East LA. And what's happening now, you could blindfold someone and take them out and... there's these condo complexes that are going up around the river and these are condo complexes that could be in Venice, in Hollywood, in Culver City. The city is starting to look the same no matter where you are. Before you would know where you were, the houses looked different, the gardens looked different, the businesses on the street looked different—just the way things are painted—hand-painted signage versus blade signs, and old bulb light or neon, that's changing. You can be anywhere and it could be the same place, and that's depressing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To me, the beauty of LA is that it looks different in different places, so you can take a mini-vacation in your own town and be someplace and it stimulates you and it recharges you and resets you. And that's starting to go away. I think the way to stop it is to have developers who are more mindful. How do we keep these communities looking like individual communities? Rather than just doing these cookie cutter developments that make you feel like you're just moving from sameness to sameness to sameness. Character means everything. That's what people remember, that's what becomes part of your cultural memory. I know everyone keeps saying, “We want affordable housing!” Well just because we want affordable housing doesn't mean it has to be a box and it has to be ugly.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In the piece, “For Now,” there’s a memorable line, “Context … in the ‘70s, was everything.” Then in another section just a little later, “...while we marked our turf with language, in clothing, through slang, we moved in and out of circles, taking pieces with us, making something new.” To us it’s striking that you’ve been able to experience so many parts of Los Angeles throughout your life... to be on a first-name basis with so many different types of people in different neighborhoods. Covering a beat is definitely your role as a reporter, but what about your experience growing up and growing older in Los Angeles, beginning in the 1970s? How much of that decade shaped you and your sensibilities as a writer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interesting question because I hadn't thought about it in terms of the decade. But yeah, I think there was something about it. There was a sense of hopefulness, because it was post-Civil Rights. I think about music, and what was in the air musically, too. I look at bands like Sly and the Family Stone, for example, and think about what were they singing about, but also what did they look like? Here was this band that was multiracial, they spoke more than one language, Portuguese, Spanish, English, probably even more, and there was something like this curiosity about “Who am I?” interacting with “What can I learn?” There was an openness that was, I won't say easy, because it was tense you know? Crossing into people's homes and, also into territories that were really sometimes fraught. It wasn't simple, but if you could get close, if you were curious, if you were open... those people, those stories, those languages were a prism through which you could view the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also had access all over LA. LA was cheaper to live in too. So there’s moving around and being able to be in different places, gas was cheap. I’d bum rides with my friends who had cars (I didn’t drive until I was in college) and we could be in the car all day, even with the gas crisis. We could go and sit someplace all day, or walk. The money part wasn't an issue, not that class didn't matter, of course it's there, but you could be different places and spend time and it just seemed, again I won’t say easier, but there didn’t seem to be these hard walls to climb, and people were open. I think that definitely did shape me, this being adjacent so much.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's see, I’ll deal with Butler first. For that book, because she wasn't here, and because I was trying to conduct this interview with a spirit, you know, in bits and pieces, I had to really think, this person isn't talking to me, she's talking to herself, and I'm going to transcribe this. Because she's asking herself questions and she's answering them and then she's going back and building on those answers as she gets older, or as she changes her mind or, as she loses interest, or she gets angry about something. And so, what I had was a lot of noise in my head and I thought, well, how would you handle this if you were transcribing a tape of somebody talking like this? And there is a point where she's even telling me I want this off the record. I had to make decisions for that book that were different. Like how do I respect her privacy, even though she left all of this material here? Does it mean she wants all of it published? When you look at somebody who's writing in their journal about the worst day they've had in their life, that's a moment, and that page is the page, that day is the day they got rid of it. Then they've moved on to something else. So, is that page indicative of who she is? Or is the journey around it and what happens afterwards more indicative? I had to make decisions about what that bad day told me, and what that bad day will tell the rest of us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for journalism shaping everything else, you know when I first started out I would tell people that journalism allows me to ask questions that I wouldn't ordinarily, and get into places and get to be closer to people that I wouldn't ordinarily be able to. Certainly the asking questions part. I am always grateful for the time people give me, and the access, because they don't have to. Sometimes I'm shocked at how open people are about their lives. I try to be a good listener and I try to be respectful and I think that all of that goes for everything I do, you know, even if I'm working on an essay that's not going to be in a newspaper or a magazine. I need to do the reporting and still follow these tenets of journalism about, what is the truth, and getting as close to the truth as I can, because everybody's version of something that happens, some major occurrence, is going to be different.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think about when I've had to cover things like, the 1992 unrest, or what happened around OJ Simpson and how that really sort of split LA in terms of guilty or not guilty, and does it matter? How is he going to be treated? You know that story was much more complex, and so it meant there’s not two sides, there are going to be many sides. And I'm going to present as much as I can. I'm going to make this messy and variegated but I'm going to give you, the reader, enough information.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Oh yes, OJ Simpson was groundbreaking in a number of ways, and such a truly LA story. How would you compare the atmospheres in Los Angeles leading up to 1992 and throughout the pandemic of 2020-2021? (Of course police brutality dominates the contemporary narrative, but I’m also thinking of other key elements like funding for community outreach organizations, merchant-consumer relationships, and urban pressure points—all of which you report on in the pages of <em>No Crystal Stair.</em>)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With George Floyd last year, [again] you felt this build up. Also this, “Something’s gonna give.” People were saying the same things then and I think a lot of the community organizers in particular, people I would use the word tireless for, they're tired. They want to be addressing other things and fixing other things and we keep circling around the same issues. So that was something that absolutely came up in my reporting. Especially around displacement, and jobs, and underemployment and job security and food security, people not being able to put food on their tables or shop for what they needed in their own neighborhoods. That's the same.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When people came out in the 1940s and ‘50s and ‘60s, they were coming out for aerospace jobs. They were coming out for jobs that taught them skills that they could learn, that made good money doing it and had benefits. And they were able to raise a family. That’s the big thing that I think we were not able to replicate, weren't able to fill in. And without that, without a place for people to start so they could support their families and send their kids to school, count on being able to get health care, and qualify for mortgages and that sort of thing. That’s a big gap.</p>

<p>Right, exactly. You know there's so many different classes of jobs. I’ve been doing work on a piece dealing a little bit with the Pullman porters, and the Black middle class, how that generation came in to do these jobs and were able to access information, had models, because they were around—white businessmen in particular—so they eavesdropped, had access to the way they worked, and learned on the job, and were able to set things up for their own families and ask the right questions and put themselves in places where very often their children were the ones to be able to have the next step up, go to college, go to graduate school, have white collar jobs. They were the ones that became the foundation for this next generation.</p>

<p>Ever since I started writing I've always wanted to take people where I was going, or else writing was a way for me to go back and relive a moment or record a moment. So, I've always been really interested in what kind of images I can create in people's heads, so that they can see precisely what I'm seeing here, precisely what I'm hearing, feeling, what I'm touching, you know, really bringing in the senses. I think I've always known since I was a kid, that change occurs, cities change, they evolve, they’re living things. But my city happens to change faster than others and I knew I needed to record it if I wanted to have that feeling and move through that feeling, and have others share it. And I spend a lot of time reading, reading certain poets and reading really vivid fiction, and that takes me somewhere in the past, the future, into a moment, you know, and rhythms. That's why I think poetry is important, there's something about rhythm in language that pulls you into a mood. That takes time and practice. But I want the reader to be walking with me in my footsteps, next to me, not necessarily behind me, but next to me.</p>

<p>Gosh, that's always a hard question because I always leave somebody out that I really love, but I spent the weekend reading Gwendolyn Brooks, which was very restorative. I love how she writes about people in cities and how they move in it, people on the edges, people on the margins, people's yearnings, people's hopes, people's dreams. Wanda Coleman, one of my favorites. She's one of the reasons that I think I could envision myself as a writer in LA, even though I didn't plan to be a poet. There is something about her example of... going to see her at readings where she would show up with her big binders and her stack of books and rustling through her papers and deciding what she's going to read in the moment. She was reading about an LA that I knew and other LA’s I didn't know but wanted to know more about. She was in all of these different communities. She was part of that bohemian Venice community. She was part of the Black Power movement in the ‘60s. She brought so much into the conversation, made it vivid to me, and she's definitely someone I revisit. I really love the work of Philip Levine, because he writes about working people. And also, just beautiful language that puts me in a very particular place and mood. Contemporary poets, Claudia Rankine and writing about race and playing with the page, the way she plays opens the page up.</p>

It's almost like this very sacred call and response that's happening on the page, it’s really poignant. Oh and Kevin Young, I really adore Kevin Young’s writing as well.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have to mention Mike Davis. I'm here because of <em>City of Quartz</em>. It was the first book I read about LA that really kind of shattered everything. And this was even before I got to know him. In our bookstores here, there might have been a California section and then there'd be one shelf of LA books, but that changed after Mike Davis. People looked at the city in a different way. It became this object to be explored in various ways and whether you saw the region as he did or not, he made us pay attention to Los Angeles. All of this scholarship grew up around LA that hadn't existed before, and I was really grateful to him. And then to be able to know him. That was the other thing, the “Oh my gosh, I can be in conversation with this person.” He lived in the same neighborhood and you could go and sit on his living room floor with a bunch of people who were working on things. We were able to keep the conversation going. <em>City of Quartz</em> was so important in a time when I was just beginning as a writer, as a journalist, I should say. I was already writing but writing about place and writing about LA and learning about the politics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Books I read for mood. One of the books I used to read, maybe not once a year but maybe every couple of years, was <em>Mildred Pierce</em>, because I love the way [James M.] Cain writes about place and class, and how he moves us through Glendale and Pasadena. The other one I would put in that category is Nathanael West’s <em>Day of the Locust</em>. Mainly because it spoke to the part of LA that my mother knew when she moved here. She lived in the Wilshire District (or what is now Korea Town), and the way she would describe the LA she arrived in I found in those books. The flora, and the streets, and the views that were unhindered, and the scent that she smelled and it was a way for me to kind of crawl back into that experience. Even though there weren't any Black people in it, it was for the backdrop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I guess these three writers, and I would have to group them, because I can't choose, but I remember discovering them when I was in newsrooms. Janet Fitch’s <em>White Oleander</em>, Nina Revoyr’s <em>Southland</em>, and Dana Johnson’s <em>Break Any Woman Down</em>, because they were writing books that were being published about an LA that I recognized with vivid characters of different races and classes, moving through this backspace, with familiar palm trees in the hills and all of that. But they spoke different languages and their slang was different. They dressed differently but this was a place they loved too and finally I felt like I had found my posse. I found my people in these books. It took decades, but here they were in fiction, writing about an LA that was recognizable to me.</p>

1059,"A History of the History of Empire, II","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In AD 1000</strong> the Aurelian walls of Rome, built to guard and protect a glittering million-city in the 3rd century, encircled a sprawling wasteland with a population of about 25,000. Riotous and dissolute, the millennial Romans lived amid surroundings for which the word “surreal” might have been invented. Colossal wrecks like the baths of Caracalla and the Colosseum itself towered above the dismembered statues of dead gods and defunct emperors, while innumerable “shapeless and enormous fragments” overawed the hovels of the living. As Gibbon puts it, “The city descended from the hills to the Campus Martius.” The Forum was an enclosure for pigs and oxen. Visitors cautiously navigated past the dung heaps and debris&nbsp; that choked the streets of the former “mistress of the world.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The city’s past, as it existed in the minds of the Romans, was as jumbled as the cityscape. Pilgrims were told of how after the Flood Noah and his sons Jason, Japhet, and Camese had voyaged to Italy and built upon the seven hills, and pointed&nbsp; to wondrous things like the uncorrupted body of the giant Pallas, slain by Aeneas—sights which made them shudder, “the heroes of the old city being the demons of the new,” as E. R. Chamberlin writes in <em>The Bad Popes</em> (1969). The history of Rome, as it had been told by Polybius, Livy, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dio Cassius, was effectively lost, replaced by a fantastic farrago of Virgilian, mythological, and biblical elements. If, as we are told, a time traveler from Augustan Rome could easily have found his way around old Rome, though appalled by its conditions, far more bewildering would have been the Millennium’s geopolitical arrangements—a world turned upside down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a prolonged time of troubles beginning in the mid-2<sup>nd</sup> century, in which the whole edifice of Empire was shaken by disunity, “barbarian” invasions, and an interminable war with Persia (in 260 the luckless emperor Valerian was captured and kept captive for life by the King of Kings, Shapur I), Rome righted itself under a new and more adaptable power elite, which by 350 prided themselves for living in the Age of Restoration. With the new class in charge, the mystique of Empire was adapted to Christianity in the East, and lived on in the Latin West even after its “fall” in 476, when Augustulus Romulus, the youth reigning in Ravenna, was deposed by the German commander, Odoacar, and sent off to a luxurious exile on the Gulf of Naples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The past changes more than the present, as Robert Lowell once said, and the distant past changes more radically than the recent. The Late Antique World, c. 150-750, took on a new aspect during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, especially during and just after the First World War, which aroused an interest in the rise and fall of past empires during the Age of Dictators in Europe, leading up to the Second World War; and continuing during the “long twilight struggle,” as John F. Kennedy called the Cold War. Was there a figure in the carpet?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>Medieval Cities </em>(1925), the great Belgian historian Henri Pirenne maintains that the Roman Empire had “one outstanding general characteristic: it was an essentially Mediterranean commonwealth.” Aging, it became even more of a maritime empire. Rome, the old capital, was inland; Constantinople, the new, was a seaport. (So was Ravenna, although its harbor eventually silted up.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;In the sixth century the emperor Justinian and his formidable consort, Theodora, had presided over the <em>Reconquista </em>of Italy, Africa, and Spain from the Goths and other Germans. While the <em>Romaioi </em>in Constantinople might boast that the Mediterranean was once again <em>mare nostrum</em>, “our sea,” Pirenne argues that it had never really ceased to be a Roman one and would remain so for another century. The ancient Greco-Roman commonwealth lived on in the material realm of law and trade, and flourished in the spiritual: missionaries dispatched from Marseille and Italy brought the Christian gospel to heathen Ireland and fallen-away England.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“The Empire was far from becoming a stranger to the lost provinces. Its civilization there outlived its authority.” Justinian’s reconquests were too far-flung to be maintained, and prophecy told of a last emperor to come before the Judgment Day. But at the beginning of the seventh century, thoughtful observers in the City, as Constantinople was known, might reasonably have expected the commonwealth to endure for another thousand years.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>It is still disputed whether the Muslim commander, Amr, ordered the burning of [Alexandria's] famous library, or merely the destruction of its book-copying industry, because the Koran had made other books superfluous.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Who</strong> in the City could have anticipated the rise of an armed prophet in the Arabian desert who would unsettle all the known world? As Philip Hitti writes in his <em>History of the Arabs</em> (1951), anyone who had the audacity to prophesy such a thing “would undoubtedly have been denounced as a lunatic. Yet, that is exactly what happened.” In his lifetime, Muhammed had pacified and united the peninsula; he had also anticipated a universal Islamic domain, an all-encompassing House of Peace. In the century following the Prophet’s death in 632, Muslim armies would spread Islam’s dominion west to the Pillars of Hercules on the Atlantic and east to the frontier of China. Not coincidentally, (even providentially to the faithful), their earliest conquests were at the expense of Byzantium and the Sassanid Persian Empire; these perennial rivals had waged a hundred-year war, concluding in 628 with the utter defeat of the Persians, having meanwhile exhausted and enfeebled both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 628 the emperor Heraclius and the Persian Kavadh II were among the princes of earth who received a letter from Muhammed, who announced himself as the “Prophet of God,” bidding them to convert to Islam for the sake of their earthly kingdoms and immortal souls; other recipients included the rulers of Ethiopia, Oman, and Egypt. Heraclius coolly dismissed, and Kavadh II angrily berated the Prophet’s messenger. More thoughtfully, Tai-shung, the reigning Tang emperor of China, gave the Prophet’s emissary a polite reception, and encouraged the construction of a mosque in Canton (now Guangzhou), which still stands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the Middle East, for centuries Byzantine territory, the end of antiquity came with cataclysmic abruptness. The Monophysite Christian majority opened their gates to the invaders. “The overtaxed, persecuted heretics made no attempt to preserve the Imperial dominion,” Sir Steven Runciman writes. “In Syria and Egypt alike they welcomed the change of masters, considering the theology of Islam closer to their own than that of Chalcedon. Only Alexandria resisted.” The siege lasted fourteen months, during which emperor Heraclius never sent relief; and when it ended, the “last stronghold of Hellenism,” had fallen. It is still disputed whether the Muslim commander, Amr, ordered the burning of its famous library, or merely the destruction of its book-copying industry, because the Koran had made other books superfluous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“Though they had no intention of destroying [Alexandria], they destroyed her, as a child might a watch,” E. M. Forster writes. “She never functioned again properly for over 1,000 years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Constantinople was menaced by Muslim arms as early as 667, and endured a harrowing siege in 717-718. But the Theodosian walls held, the Arabs froze and starved in the Thracian winter, and the Empire harassed them with Greek fire, Byzantium’s version of napalm. In the West, Islam’s conquests looked about to be extended from Spain beyond the Pyrenees until the Arabs were repelled by the army of the French prince Charles Martel, at the Battle of Tours in 732. In a famous passage, Gibbon imagines an alternative history:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland: the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such a catastrophe might have been averted, but the essence of the ancient regime—which was based on sea power—was gone. Encircled by Muslim conquests, what had been the Roman Empire’s inland sea had become part of Islam’s vast domain, and the waters of the Mediterranean, which had been free of piracy under the long <em>Pax Romana</em>, was at once given over to corsairs, as they were now called. In any case, the effect was forever to disrupt age-old patterns of culture and commerce, as Pirenne tells:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Their fleets sailed [the Mediterranean) in complete mastery; commercial flotillas transported the products of the West to Cairo, whence they were dispatched to Baghdad, or pirate fleets devastated the coast of Provence and Italy and put towns to the torch after they had been pillaged and their inhabitants captured to be sold as slaves.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast to Islam, which had become expansive and cosmopolitan, the Latin West was forced for the first time to rely on its own resources. The Frankish Empire, hitherto marginal, became “the arbiter of Europe’s destinies.” In the space of a page Pirenne gets to the essence of the famous thesis he would elaborate in his posthumous book, <em>Mahomet et Charlemagne </em>(1937), and epitomize as: “Charlemagne, without Muhammad, would be inconceivable.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all of its decline and fall, Rome remained a prize, a destination, and place for history to be&nbsp; made. On Christmas Day, AD 800, in St. Peter’s, the grandson of Charles Martel was crowned emperor of the West by Pope Leo III; having intended to crown himself at some opportune time, Charlemagne was startled by Leo’s proleptic gesture, but accepted the obeisance hitherto given only to the emperor in Constantinople. Unfortunately, its new overlords in Gaul were too far away to secure Rome from Muslim incursions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 846, launching from their base in Sicily, Saracen raiders sailed up the Tiber to Rome, where St. Peter’s on Vatican Hill, unprotected by Aurelian’s wall on the opposite side of Tiber, was looted of its treasures. Arab traders trooped their captives in ports like Taranto, where Bernard the Monk claimed to have seen 12,000 enslaved Italians being herded to a waiting fleet for shipment to Africa.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In</strong> the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> centuries, the papacy had become a battered trophy for Rome’s aristocratic families to contend for. The suspiciously short reigns of elderly nonentities alternated with the stormy ones of young scions. John XII, elected to be the vicar of Christ in 954, at the age of sixteen, was a headstrong, libidinous youth, who lived up to the legendary vices of his family, the Theophylacts. His great-grandmother Theodora, had her lover, the Bishop John of Ravenna, installed as Pope John X, having previously secured her influence by providing her teenage daughter, Marozia, as a mistress for the Bishop’s recent predecessor, Sergius II. After Sergius’s death she married Marozia to a soldier of fortune, Alberic, marquis of Camerino, who was lionized after leading a decisive campaign against the Saracens, who had now advanced within forty miles of Rome, and were collecting tolls. With this danger removed, the Romans could now devote themselves to their customary intrigues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grown to formidable maturity, Marozia became known as the senatrix of Rome—not only the mistress and mother of popes (her illegitimate son by Pope Sergius II would reign as Sergius III)—but also the murderer of her mother Theodora’s lover, John X, who in 928 was seized and either starved or strangled in the dungeon of Castel Sant’Angelo (Hadrian’s tomb). Alberic disappears from the scene, perhaps to resume a life of crime, freeing Morazia to marry her lover Hugh of Provence—a potentially world historical match, considering the youth and pliability of her son the pope, who had it in his power to name them emperor and empress of the West. Inconveniently, Morazia had a younger son, Alberic’s namesake, but Hugh intended to blind him, following the custom that Italy had adopted from Byzantium of disabling a family member who stood in the way. Instead, Alberic the younger roused the Romans against the couple and, true to family form, arrested Morazia and consigned her to the castle’s dungeon for life. His half-brother, Sergius III, was relieved of temporal power, which Alberic exercised for twenty years as prince of Rome.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As he lay dying, the prince summoned Rome’s aristocrats to St. Peter’s tomb and made them swear a great oath that they would recognize his son Octavian, as his worldly heir, and, when the office became vacant, successor to the papacy as well. Having also inherited his father’s rivals and enemies—Berengar of Lombardy was closest at hand—the pope-king appealed to Otto, the Saxon prince who had mastered most of what had been Charlemagne’s empire, to become his protector, promising him what had been Charlemagne’s crown as a reward. Otto I was crowned at St. Peter’s on February 2, 961, marking the formal beginning of what became known as the Holy Roman Empire, of which Voltaire would say it was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire, and yet would endure for a thousand years. In May 996, his pious grandson Otto III, though fully expecting to be the last emperor, and eager to abdicate to Christ, dispensed with formality; and, when the papacy became vacant, he astonished Rome by simply appointing his cousin Bruno to reign as Gregory V in the short interval, as he expected, before the end of the world.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the Millennium the dynastic feuds that consumed Italian prelates and German emperors were like back-alley escapades compared to the history unfolding in the vast dominions that otherwise encompassed their known world. “There are two empires,” wrote the Patriarch in Constantinople, “that of the Saracens, and the Romans (meaning the Greeks) who hold between them the entirety of power in this world, shining like twin torches in the celestial firmament.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the Latin West figuratively sat in darkness, Byzantium, the richest and most populous city in the world, and the Islamic capitals of Abbasid Baghdad and Moorish Cordoba in Spain(al-Andalus) literally blazed; the former preserving some of the glamor of the Arabian Nights, the latter (by modern standards) a cynosure of tolerance, sanitation, and night lighting. A presumably devout yet cosmopolitan intellectual elite kept these capitals and Cairo, Bukhara, and Samarkand in correspondence. Algebra, chemistry, Arabic numerals, and Aristotle were invented, refined, or preserved. Over the horizon, just out of Europe’s ken, was a Chinese empire vaster, more populous, more prosperous, and far more scientifically advanced. Yet, it was in the eleventh century that Europe became engaged in what Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., blithely calls “the adventure of entering and altering nonwestern societies,” which would last almost another thousand years.</p>

<p><strong>In his compendious</strong> <em>The City in History</em> of 1961, Lewis Mumford singled out the importance and uniqueness of the “University City,” and in his supportive photograph flashed on the city of Berkeley with its University of California to drive home his point: “The most essential role of the city …—that of enlarging and transmitting the cultural heritage—is now being performed chiefly in university cities, of the order of Berkeley.” The University holds a key position: “For the school sprang from the Greek <em>polis</em>’ margin of leisure, and in the opening age, paideia, or education in the fullest sense, … will become the essential business of life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A mere three years later University of California President Clark Kerr followed up on Berkeley with his Harvard lecture on <em>The Uses of the University</em>, in which he highlighted the university as the modern equivalent in its multifarious functions to the classic city, just as the college campus town had been to the town. This city should be henceforth titled <em>Ideopolis</em> and would brew vast new cultural, artistic and intellectual progeny that the university alone was capable of supplying to modern life through its role as a <em>Multiversity</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost immediately, unresponsive critics—many being university undergraduates who had engaged in civil rights action in the American South—lashed out against this student-unfriendly vision of the university to set off the Free Speech Movement (FSM) of 1964. From that moment on “Berkeley” became permanently associated with the accusatory cognomen—and celebration—of “Radical.” Over thirty-odd years later and despite fundamental changes at the university itself as well the surrounding city of Berkeley, such “radicalism” has remained so strongly associated with Berkeley that fictional Mafia boss Tony Soprano could but harshly forbid (as only Mafioso dons can do) daughter Meadow from ever contemplating attending such a cesspool of radicalism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As ever, Tony was prescient in his raw sense for reality. After all “Berkeley” had been invented by Californians for a civic site that remains the only world-historical example of a full-sized city or urban space named after an eponymous hero culled from the annals of formal Philosophy (there has never been a Greek Platoville, French Descartesburg, or even Chinese Confuciusopolis). The philosopher whom the city fathers meant to celebrate was the scandalous George Berkeley, and his eighteenth-century message was “Immaterialism”:&nbsp; strictly speaking, ladies and gentlemen, Matter does not exist, reality consists either of Perceiving or Being Perceived, in short, it is through and through “Spiritual.” It is an outlook that, however coincidentally, is mirrored by hosts of Berkeley “crazies” (“Berserkeley”) who have shaken the contours of the ordinary or conventional reality enjoyed by the rest of us mortals dwelling in this city that squarely faces the Golden Gate and opens out into the largest ocean of the known universe, this “Athens of the Pacific” destined to adjudicate, however clumsily and self-righteously, all critical ideological currents between East and West.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Berkeley protest example went on to unhinge a host of other campuses and urban centers across the globe. There were a number of commendable practical results—elimination of the traditional university in loco parentis being a common and overdue benefit. What is however difficult to grasp from the outside is the Experience itself, about which the participants found themselves—as in the case of True Love—generally inarticulate (Berkeleyan Michael Rossman coming closest in his efforts to formulate the Ineffable). It is something that participants to the <em>joli Mai</em> of Paris 1968 or, for that matter, the Velvet Revolution of 1989 Prague similarly flunked at.</p>

<p>Philosopher Martin Heidegger once defined the <em>polis</em> itself as “the site, the <em>Da</em> in which and as which <em>Da-sein</em> as historical is, the history-site… from which History Happens.” If <em>Da</em> is to be translated as “openness” (as Heidegger had the right to insist from his English readers), then we have a meaningless—but not pointless—definition urging us to contemplate the openness that necessarily belongs to the authentically historical. Whatever the cavils about Berkeley between the FSM in 1964 and the People’s Park demonstrations of 1969 (which incidentally came up with the first use of “green” through Girl Scout uniform flags for forthcoming expressions of environmentalism), something “extra”-ordinary had clearly transpired along its lanes and avenues.</p>

<p><strong>No</strong> big surprise then that the psychedelic, or more properly “psychonautic,” revolution also burst out of Berkeley during this very period. There, in Thomas Pynchon’s one great novel <em>The Crying of Lot 49</em>, goes Oedipa Maas crossing the Berkeley campus circa 1965 to negotiate that tremblingly taut line between campus revolutionaries and a burgeoning LSD-soaked intuition. It seems a far cry from Emerson Elementary and Berkeley High graduate Thornton Wilder’s concoction of his prototypal <em>Our Town</em> in 1938, ostensibly located in New Hampshire but really all about the quiet streets and pathways of a remembered Berkeley. Yet both after all share ruminations on death and ghosts of sorts—that Other universe which psychonauts above all ache to access. To help the cause Berkeley even put up a factory (across from the present Totland children’s park) to churn out Owsley Stanley’s fabled LSD pills (“Owsleys”), and over the course of a half-century Berkeley native Alexander Shulgin ran a dizzying set of psychedelic doses in his magical lab, highlighted by his synthesis of MDMA into the therapeutic and rave-club superstar Ecstasy.</p>

<p>In the course of which young Terence McKenna arrives on the FSM campus in 1965 and shortly thereafter first smokes the super-powerful psychedelic DMT in 1966, perched, as Erik Davis glosses in his informative <em>High Weirdness</em>, to take on “the radical subversion of reality itself.” Later in 1985 McKenna in Berkeley meets José Argüelles, at that time a San Francisco State professor in art and cultural history before graduating to the future Mayanist prophet Valum Votam, where they concoct the grand idea of an epochal cosmic transformation in 2012, presumably according to the Mayan calendar (and perhaps the <em>I Ching</em>). Of course they were right: the Singularity, first announced by L.A. novelist Franz Werfel in his 1945 masterpiece <em>Star of the Unborn</em> and later cribbed by a host of futurological louts, has indeed always been taking place (have a glance about you when embarked on a psychonautic voyage); but from an “autochthonous” Berkeleyan perspective, so what?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course more “serious” events presaging the total destruction of the Earth have chosen Berkeley for their toxic cradle. Thanks to physicist Robert Oppenheimer, Berkeley was key to the creation and detonation of the atom bomb through the Manhattan Project that Oppenheimer not only directed but also specifically sited on Los Alamos, over—you guessed it—Native American ancestral lands. Oppenheimer may have repented his involvement in time, but his colleague Edward Teller, pushing on to the fatal splendors of the hydrogen bomb, would later await word of the fatal experiment in the basement of the University of California geology building: “the sound waves took twenty minutes to carry the message under the Pacific and arrive in Berkeley.” After all it had been on the Berkeley campus that while the chimes rang out “like the music of the spheres” for the first time the conversation of these technoscience giants had turned to the “idea of man-made suns.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Preferring to sound the story of Berkeley in a more benign key, the Beat Movement, now an irremovable cultural kidney stone in intellectual history, experienced perhaps its gentlest moments in the floral vales of Berkeley backstreets. A cottage on 1624 Milvia Street once nestled Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Jack Kerouac to ponder Buddhist profundities and Tantric erections. Kerouac’s reminiscent <em>The Dharma Bums</em> captures a mood which, however fictionalized, does retain some of that “flowery” flavor, as Kerouac biographer Anne Charters has described Berkeley (in his most famous treatise even Mexican author Octavio Paz had to acknowledge “la bellezza de Berkeley”). Temporarily envisaging Berkeley as a possible home for himself and his mother, and even renting an apartment on 1943 Berkeley Way, Kerouac ran one day into Neal Cassady to pass on to its hero a first copy of <em>On the Road</em>, thus perfecting the Best Buddy storyline. Alas, only a storyline, given both Cassady’s and Kerouac’s later rapid descents into meaningless deaths.</p>

<p>More positively instructive are the narratives of science-fiction masters Ursula Le Guin and Philip K. Dick—at least for a while. Both 1947 graduates from the same Berkeley High class without knowing of each other, Le Guin and Dick went on to reframe the interrelated genres of science fiction, fantasy, and space opera, Le Guin carrying through an imposing oeuvre of fictional and philosophical writings right to her death, while Dick eventually devolved into a long paranoid fix (in the Orange County of his day no less) punctuated by images of reborn Roman villains and Christian fugitives, of which he was presumably one. Still, the years 1968-1969 witnessed some of their best productions in charting worlds bearing the broadest of speculative possibilities, not excluding Le Guin’s razor-sharp glimpses into emerging gender, ethnic and racial futures.</p>

<p><strong>Appropriately</strong> for some such utopian/dystopian spirits the “New Age” proper naturally found eager adherents among a generation or more of Berkeley Seekers. Besides the occasional presence of such New Age publishers as Shambhala Press, which brought out Tantric Buddhist texts at a time of the Dalai Lama’s visits to the Buddhist Nyingma Center, a bevy of presumably enlightened visitors—from EST guru Werner Erhard, who had been turned on to Martin Heidegger’s philosophy by Berkeley professor Hubert Dreyfus to Rajneesh and his orange-garbed acolytes floating down from Rajneeshpuram in Oregon to the money mammaries of the Bay Area—kept aflame the long-standing Berkeley flirtation with Convenience, both spiritual and material, going back perhaps all the way to Charles Keeler and his Hillside circle in North Berkeley. Keeler’s “Simple-Home” philosophy, conceived in friendship with organic architect Bernard Maybeck—whose student Julia Morgan flocked the hills and city of Berkeley with many a sturdy example of redwood craftsman—set forth the characteristic Berkeley aspiration to domestic comfort, functionality, environmentality, and a strong dose of Spirituality. Not to ignore cuisine and drink either: Berkeley’s “gourmet ghetto” came to star Alice Waters’ forays into a distinctive California cuisine at her celebrated Chez Panisse restaurant, while around the block, in conjunction with Berkeley’s introduction of coffeehouses and expressos to the United States Alfred Peet launched the first Peet’s coffee shop at Vine and Walnut. Supporting such Berkeleyan flavorings there is even a distinctive Berkeley signage around town cultivated by designer David Lance Goines that one might provisionally dub “Berkeley artisan craft.”</p>

<p>A world center for academic publishing, Berkeley prodded one UC Press editor Ernest Callenbach to etch out in his self-published <em>Ecotopia</em> a first exercise in ecological sustainability. The environmentalist constrictions his utopia imposed were meant for Berkeley’s primarily white residents, but Callenbach graciously allowed its Black constituents a longer period in conspicuous consumption as a concession to cultural catch-up. To be sure, Callenbach’s Berkeley has been touted as the Californian “Capital of the Upper Left,” bastion of a resolute progressivism which, while not risking the kind of sophisticated Marxism of Critical Theory that the last of the Frankfurt School, Leo Löwenthal and his long-standing Berkeley reading group, encapsulated, has remained sufficiently “left” to merit its notoriety as the most liberal city on the planet (incidentally rejecting Donald Trump by 95-3% in 2016 and 93-4% in 2020). Thanks to its reputation and incidental amenities Berkeley has long offered facilities and support for people of disabilities with its Center for Independent Living, and it has ranked as a preferred locale for widely diverse gender lifestyles.</p>

<p>Back in 1954 however, my neighbor Gene Tarrant sought far and wide for a home for him and his wife Mary in the Berkeley hills; without success, notwithstanding friendly smiles of avoidance. Eventually he settled for a home on 2327 Edwards Street in Berkeley’s flatlands in a section called “Poet’s Corner.” The morning after he and Mary moved in, a hostile mob with quiet menace waited for them outside on his lawn. Having risked a full Pacific stint as Pearl Harbor survivor and warrior, Gene simply dismissed them out of hand; they never showed up again. Gene went on to start the first Berkeley neighborhood committee, for which Edwards Street has been more lately named after him and Mary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gene’s home lies some three blocks from the apartment where U.S. vice-president (and possible future first woman president) Kamala Harris grew up. She recalls the area as “a close-knit neighborhood of working families” where “people believed in the most basic tenet of the American Dream.”</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Nature<br>noun<br>The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations.<br> <br>Wilderness<br>noun<br>An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SEEMINGLY BENIGN</strong>, “nature” and “wilderness” frame a worldview we are often scarcely aware of. The words form an anthropocentric dichotomy between the human and the other-than-human,  limiting and forming the world more than they describe it. To speak of “nature” or “wilderness” in California is to erase its First People. Yet, what is a city without wilderness? To Native Californians, the land is alive and inexorably tied to them as they are to it. Since Time Immemorial, Native Californian have tended to the land. Over time they formed a relational landscape of remarkable abundance scarcely equaled on the Earth. Colonizers mistook this relational landscape as “natural,” and the ramifications of this mistake grow annually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The City was not born from chance. Located at the convergence of seemingly innumerable biotic, geographic, geologic, and hydrographic networks—the City exists because of its heightened and localized potential to extract [<em>verb</em>. remove or take out, especially by effort or force] and consume [<em>verb</em>. use up (a resource)] the networks of the land. Indeed, the growth of the City depended on its consumption of Native lands and Native bodies—a period of time in California when it was bluntly referred to as extermination. The concepts of “wilderness” and “nature” engendered this genocide, transforming populated cultural landscapes into unpossessed lands, and ripe for extraction and consumption. “Wilderness” enabled the Gold Rush; it gave a moral rationale to clear cutting the redwoods and hunting the California Grizzly to the point of extinction. Through this lens, it can be said the City exists <em>because</em> of “wilderness.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In contrast, the Ohlone, Coast &amp; Bay Miwok, Patwin, and Delta Yokuts have lived in reciprocity with the landscape since they came into being. To stand among the redwoods on Mount Tamalpais or the manzanitas of San Bruno is to be present within Native California culture and agency. Admittedly, Bay Area ecosystems are fractured and isolated—we can also see them as ardently defiant of the City and its sprawl. Coho and chinook salmon still migrate up the Sacramento River toward concrete tombstones, rebelliously spawning in the shadow of obliteration. The long-thought-to-be lost Presidio Manzanita awoke along the El Camino Real after more than a century of slumber—who knows what else is still sleeping? Wolves are remembering our woods, and one by one returning to reclaim what is theirs. It is no longer a question of <em>if</em> the Condor will return, but when.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ponder the fate of the City, I look to its birth—its purpose for being. Though its economy now hinges upon extracting the details of our lives rather than the essence of the land, an extractive ethos remains—and with it, assured collapse. This should come as no surprise in a landscape of sinking skyscrapers, rising seas, dying forests, tainted waters, depleted fisheries, apocalyptic fire-cycles, and lingering drought—all precariously balanced upon tectonic plates locked in a tango where one eventual move will obliterate every aspect of security and safety.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To see the City we must see it weighted by “wilderness;” through reevaluating “nature” we&nbsp; interrogate our tacit assumptions of personhood and self. We must ask ourselves: Whose lands are we on? Whose abundance are we extracting? Whom are we harming for our convenience? These questions cannot be answered in isolation. But in the Bay Area, it’s a process that can begin with #LandBack and #SaveTheBerkeleyShellmound, led by Native Californian voices. The City’s boundaries are imaginary, an arbitrary circumscription in a vast living network stretching across the hills, creeks, rivers, valleys, mountains, through the earth and sea. The abundance of these networks served as the impetus for the City—I see no reason why they won’t direct its fate.</p>

<p>Seventy-five years later, writer and raconteur Fran Lebowitz published her own propositions on the subject in the essay-series <em>Metropolitan Life </em>(1975) and forty-five years later she televised them, collaborating with Martin Scorsese to produce the seven-part Netflix series <em>Pretend It’s A City.</em> Here Lebowitz, adopting the quintessentially metropolitan persona of the flaneur, coolly navigates New York, reporting on facets of its character and evolution—cultural affairs, finance, sports, public services, and transport—to Scorsese. Neatly assuming Simmel’s blasé outlook, she is drolly perturbed but never overwhelmed by habitual interruptions to her day-to-day which are chiefly manifested in the incompetence of others: dawdlers, ill-advised city-planners, inert tourists, public artists, and so on. She’s impervious to much and so much passes her by—new technologies such as smart phones for instance (pardonable) but also the near municipal bankruptcy of 1970s New York (less pardonable).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the while Lebowitz, much like Simmel, maintains unwavering affection for and loyalty to the city she inhabits, doggedly declaring that there is nowhere else for her. It’s the breed of affection associated with romantic relationships whereby one recognises their partner’s shortcomings but owing to compatibility accepts them regardless or even because of their flaws. In recognition of this, critics unanimously declared <em>Pretend It’s a City </em>a triumph, lauding the series as a “love letter to New York”—a city very much Lebowitz’s own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But possession is fraught, and it’s worth asking precisely what acclimates Leibowitz to her environment, for in the incisive words of geographer David Harvey, “the question of what kind of city we want cannot be divorced from that of what kind of social ties, relationship to nature, lifestyles, technologies and aesthetic values we desire” and, crucially, have access to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Pretend It’s a City</em> confronts the viewer with an inescapable truth: Lebowitz’s relationship to New York—her sense of belonging—is surely predicated on her financial status. This is perhaps most evident in her attitude to property. Embittered with an archetypal New Yorker’s concern for real estate, Lebowitz acerbically grumbles about rising prices and ill-advised deals.  She recalls refusing to live in the West Village on the logic of eluding rape which, she reasons “I always felt was worth the extra money.” Amplifying this uncomfortable association between money and gendered violence, she divulges buying an apartment that cost three times what she could afford, likening her insistence on retaining her previous one—also expensive—to the compulsion of women who stay with men “who beat them up.” Putting aside the dubious humor of these statements, the suggestion that to live in New York demands wealth as a prerequisite for survival is surely dispiriting, especially as this assessment is affirmed when Lebowitz, asked what advice she would offer a young person moving to the city, recommends, “Bring money.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite my reservations, I am broadly heartened by the inclusion of a documentary on urbanism broadcast on a mainstream platform like Netflix. But by way of contrast, let me turn to two other less marketable productions—which share with <em>Pretend it’s a City</em>, a concern for the expression of urban identity.</p>

<p>The late French-Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman, like Lebowitz, resided in New York in the 1970s. She is said to have professed to director Jean-Luc Godard, “I love to film cities. I love to film cities because they have lines.” Such partiality is evident in the cinematography of <em>News From Home </em>(1977) where Akerman’s camera—operated with frequent collaborator Babette Mangolte—consistently asserts the Manhattan grid with linear perspectival orientation defining every shot. Now streaming on The Criterion Channel, <em>News From Home</em> opens with a peripheral view of an anonymous apartment block captured by a camera positioned between forty-eight and fifty-six inches from the ground, imitating Akerman’s perspective of looking up at buildings which loom ominously above. Continuing thus, the camera, unceasingly located at Akerman’s height, forces the viewer to confront the city as she sees it—full of street-level exteriors, subway platforms and trains, residential buildings, and office blocks—from a vertical sightline. This rigorous adherence to perspectival space conveys Ackerman’s relationship to the city with the viewer, observing New York through her eyes, dwarfed almost menacingly by its built environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A passage from Jean Rhys’s novel <em>Good Morning, Midnight</em> illuminates. Rhys’s female narrator, Sasha, an impoverished alcoholic, wanders Paris: “If you have money and friends,” then “houses stand back respectfully” but if not, “then they step forward, the waiting house, to frown and crush. No hospitable doors, no lit windows, just frowning darkness. Frowning and leering and sneering, the houses one after another. Tall cubes of darkness, with two lighted eyes at the top to sneer. And they know who to frown at. They know as well as the policeman on the corner.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paris’s built environment, anthropomorphised, engenders fear and paranoia in Rhys’s alienated protagonist. Akerman’s visual rendering of New York, not unlike Rhys’s literary one of Paris, conveys the power that architecture wields over the individual. Compare this to <em>Pretend it’s a City</em> where Leibowitz, traversing the Queens Museum’s panorama of New York, towers over the scaled-down miniatures which populate the cityscape, visually asserting that it is she not the urban environment that dominates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Akerman’s soundtrack, entirely post-dubbed, further demarcates her alienation. She reads lyrically from letters sent by her mother Natalie, whose expressions of maternal anxieties about her child’s welfare—whether she is sufficient in summer clothes, money or happiness—are scarcely audible, overwhelmed by the cacophonic clamour of automobiles and ambient chatter. It becomes clear that Natalie’s inquiries remain unanswered, for she implores her daughter to reply to her letters, frets over if she has the correct address, and finally probes: “You never write about how you’re really doing.” And it is true that we neither hear nor view Akerman directly, who instead, conspicuous in her absence, refuses interaction with both us, the viewer, and the swathes of people who hurriedly bustle through the city. And so, unlike Lebowitz who is buoyed up by parties and friendships with the famous, Akerman communicates an uneasy relationship with New York, her voice and corporeality lost in its indifference.</p>

<p>In London, the Black Audio Film Collective, inaugurated in 1982 and dissolved in 1992, comprised eight British diaspora filmmakers and artists, namely: John Akomfrah, Avril Johnson, Reece Auguiste, Lina Gopaul, Trevor Mathison, Edward George, Claire Joseph, and David Lawson. Their films, perhaps best characterised as forceful rejections of the racist narratives perpetuated in dominant media and political propaganda, express the plurality of Black British experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Twilight City</em> (1989) is not the Collective’s most well-known film but is among their most accomplished—its fusion of different aesthetic forms, cinematic experimentation and political urgency typifies their trademark style. Its structure, almost identical to that of <em>News from Home</em>, employs epigraphic correspondence between a young woman, Octavia, and her mother, Eugenia, as the backbone of its narrative. The titular city is London where the collective was then based, and it is Olivia’s letter to her mother that is voiced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Departing from Akerman’s epigraphic formula, Olivia’s narrative is interspliced with archival footage of industrialization and talking heads who enlarge upon her personal loss by attesting more factually to the city’s demise and the consequent deracination of its urban communities—it’s the fusion of different modes that make the film, and indeed the rest of the collective’s works, so powerfully effective. Historian Rozina Vishram speaks about the community of nineteenth-century Somalian Lascar seamen who, brought to London in ships chartered by the East India Company, were abandoned to poverty, their diaspora descendants forced into liminal urban existence. Writer David Yallop recalls the Clapham of his childhood as a working-class district which he once felt rooted to and safe in; now, he views it as an alien middle-class enclave strewn of its character. Historian Paul Gilroy reiterates Yallop’s lament, reminiscing on his youthful explorations of the Docklands area which at the time acted as a hub for white working-class communities who were forced into dispersal when the Port of London became obsolescent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Olivia’s subjective voice converges with the more objective ones of the commentators in ascribing blame to Britain’s Conservative government, captained by prime minister Margaret Thatcher, for engendering the capital’s demise. And while there is a recognition that certain communities—especially diasporic ones—have survived displacement albeit scathed, the solemn tone is a far-cry from that of<em> Pretend It’s a City</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this, I think, is what feels conspicuously absent in <em>Pretend It’s a City</em>, for Lebowitz in her acerbic—at times self-congratulatory—insistence on belonging overlooks those who don’t. In fact, the only times we really come across anyone who’s not a famed intellectual or renowned artist—the likes of Toni Morrison or Charles Menkes—is in in Lebowitz’s complaints lodged in contempt of her fellow urban inhabitants: bus drivers who don’t know their routes by heart, tempestuous dry cleaners, cab drivers oblivious to Grand Central Station, rather than hegemonic or legislative power structures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Akerman and the Black Audio Film Collective, in their own distinct ways, refute this approach. Mobilizing their purview as filmmakers, they trace the narratives of those who feel alien in the city—those who don’t belong—and shrewdly critique the forces that engender this feeling. For Ackerman, there is a sense that having relocated from Brussels, she never quite assimilates—the very title <em>News From Home</em> is indicative of her understanding of New York as a fundamentally foreign place. <em>Twilight City,</em> on the other hand, conveys how the coercive forces of imperialism and late capitalism displace entire communities from the urban spaces they once understood as their home. There is a moment in <em>Twilight City </em>where Gilroy speaks of the extraordinary way “in which people are able to inhabit the same space, to be physically proximate and yet to live in different worlds.” Leibowitz’s world, populated by celebrity intellectuals, expensive apartments, theaters and parties, <em>is</em> a world elsewhere from most and it would be a better film if she and Scorsese acknowledged it.</p>

<p>“<strong><em>Athens is at most a two day kinda thing</em></strong>.” Visitors headed to the Greek islands have historically been discouraged from spending much, if any, time in the Greek capital, often by Greeks themselves. Substantiating complaints cite Athens’s concrete sprawl, with the same style apartment building haphazardly replicated from the Acropolis to the port of Piraeus. Tourists typically assume this drab uniformity must be the work of stylistically unimaginative bureaucrats working in service of authoritarian regimes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In reality, these apartments, which the Greeks call “<em>polikatoikias,”</em> are the result of a decades-long practice initiated by Athenians themselves, without any participation of local or state governments. This spontaneous, extra-governmental building boom created long-term housing solutions for generations of Greek families. But today, this same lack of political oversight is leading to the exodus of Greek nationals from entire neighborhoods of Athens. Foreign investors have exploited the financial precarity of Athenians and the disinterest of local authorities to make way for “ghost hotels,” residential buildings evacuated and converted into short-term rental units. How could the successful, commonized housing practices of the twentieth century be so vulnerable to the social atomization and inequality of our current moment?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the sixty-year period between 1920 and 1980, Athens’s population exploded from roughly 300,000 to three million residents. Although Greeks sometimes use the term “<em>astyphilia</em>” (the “city-friendliness” which attracts people to the big city) to account for the capital's transition into a modern megalopolis, the conditions for this period of Athenian expansion were far from idyllic. The increasingly dire condition of Greeks in Turkish territories after the First World War forced the government in Athens to negotiate the repatriation of at least a million Anatolian Greeks to the Greek homeland in 1923, concurrent with the removal of Turks from Greece to Turkey. Greece was a poor country that had been at war with the Ottoman Empire for a decade. Athens had to build <em>rapidly</em>. The war had diminished public reserves, necessitating a decentralized system of construction that doubled as a mass employment project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As refugees were arriving from Asia Minor, Greece was celebrating a century of independence. Greek architects had spent much of that century fine-tuning a neoclassical style to make Athenians feel like heirs to an ancient empire rather than embittered victims of a series of foreign colonizers, Roman, Byzantine, Phoenician, or Ottoman. Even then, the Athenian variant of neoclassical style was a bargain between vernacular pride and appeals for cultural legitimacy from wealthier Western European nations (which had invented neoclassicism to legitimize themselves during their “golden years” of imperial domination). These remnants of neoclassical Athens possess charm, but their lineage involves an<em> </em>uncanny configuration of removal and imitation—Athenian neoclassicism is a <em>local interpretation</em> of a <em>foreign simulation</em> of a <em>local ancient typology.</em> Athens’s search for an independent vernacular ironically produced the look of a colonial outpost, awkwardly incorporating Latin, Venetian, and even Germanic architectural traditions as its own.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>This spontaneous, extra-governmental building boom created long-term housing solutions for generations of Greek families. But today, this same lack of political oversight is leading to the exodus of Greek nationals from entire neighborhoods of Athens.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many Athenians were eager for modern appliances, and the war had made them aware of the cultural and technological innovations in other European capitals. (Wooden bathtubs were still quite common.) Neoclassical homes were also structurally and aesthetically resistant to any sort of modifications that would accommodate the growing population.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surprisingly, many Athenians welcomed their homes being torn down. Contractors and homeowners began reaching agreements: contractors would raze a family’s home, build a polikatoikia in its place and give the family two to three apartments in the new structure, which they could rent out or pass on to family. This system was called “<em>antiparochi</em>.” Athenians were eager to participate in the modernization of Athens, and beneficiaries of antiparochi exchanges earned a social prestige that encouraged their neighbors to opt-in. By 1929, the government began offering tax breaks to antiparochi contractors and apartment owners. True to its name, (which roughly translates to “mutual exchange”) antiparochi agreements were settled horizontally, without any intervention from bankers, lawyers, or housing authorities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Antiparochi survived the political turbulence of the post-World War II era and maintained a level of relative social equality through decades of right-wing governments hostile or indifferent to such a concept. The demand for housing in Athens was met. Whereas neoclassical Athens separated social classes by neighborhood, families with varying incomes now lived in the same buildings. Construction became a major industry, bringing many into the trade. Athens linked up to various international architectural movements (most antiparochis deployed Corbusier's Maison Dom-Ino plan—a model that eliminates load bearing walls and allows for modular floor plans), giving Athenians a renewed pride in their now exceptionally modern city. The omnipresence of balconies on polikatoikia allowed outdoor space for almost every dwelling and guaranteed a controlled variable for the “eyes on the street” theory of crime prevention. To this day, Greek homeownership hovers around seventy percent.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Forfeiting so many units to the short-term rental market has led to a distortion of housing prices and the complete disappearance of Greeks from significant portions of their own capital city.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the drawbacks to such an unregulated, ad hoc system are obvious in retrospect. Many of the contractors were amateurs who sought corners to cut, particularly with regards to crucial steel foundations. Many of the polikatoikia had to be reinforced or their facades remodeled (a program for beautifying apartment exteriors named “<em>prosopsi”</em> (frontage) was rolled out in anticipation of the 2004 Olympics). Pollution billowed out from a now uniformly concrete city. The spontaneity of antiparochi construction provided little opportunity for planners or activists to leave room for green spaces. Older Athenians lamented the old Athens, the neoclassical village with porous flow between the rural outskirts and the city center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a time, the antiparochi period provided so much affordable housing that it nearly eradicated demand for social housing. As a result, very little was built and Athens maintains a conscious “non policy” with regard to stabilizing housing markets. Today, this oversight has come into relief. Greece maintains the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, and yet housing costs are rising at an alarming rate. Since the financial collapse of 2008, many Athenians with non-performing loans have been forced to hand their apartments over to the banks. Austerity politics have forced many pensioners or other state beneficiaries to likewise vacate their apartments. Oftentimes, these units end up auctioned off to a handful of international investors who convert them into short-term rentals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forfeiting so many units to the short-term rental market has led to a distortion of housing prices and the complete disappearance of Greeks from significant portions of their own capital city. Sotiris Sideris, a data journalist, has found that in the Koukaki neighborhood, just south of the Acropolis, seventy percent of former residences are now Airbnbs. More than half of short-term rentals are now owned by “superhosts” who’ve bought up multiple properties backed by private equity funds managing Greek real estate investment trusts. “Antiparochi families” that formerly benefited from extra units to pass on to relatives have been incentivized to rent to tourists, breaking with a tradition that brought prosperity, longevity, and cohesion to Greek families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many posts for rooms in high Airbnb density neighborhoods offer depressing promises of invisibilizing the remaining Greek tenants, lest tourists be exposed to the burden of Greek hospitality. “<em>There is no direct contact with people living in the building, which is an advantage to feel comfortable during your stay in the apartment</em>” one post reads. Another: “<em>The flat has an incredible view over Athens with absolutely no neighbours in sight.</em>”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, the most gullible travel writers on the internet offer unpersuasive celebrations of the neighborhood as a hotspot of artists and locals, with some calling it the “hippest” neighborhood in Europe. <em>The Washington Post</em> writes, “<em>Koukaki is a once-quiet corner near downtown Athens that used to be home to families and, later, to an older generation of Athenians. Their grandchildren have since moved in and brought an injection of vibrancy, creativity and new ideas that have revitalized the neighborhood. Today, it’s where the city’s artistic types are most likely to be found, or just those who know where the good bars are tucked away.</em>” These accounts obfuscate the devastating effects of Airbnb for long-term residents of Athens. It takes someone wholly unfamiliar with Greek socioeconomic realities to claim that the “new Koukaki” is the result of some peaceful transition of ownership between Athenian age groups. Neither the elderly, many of whom have seen their pensions reduced by half, nor the chronically unemployed Athenian youth are in any position to contest for Koukaki’s rental units. It’s not a story of local creativity generating income, either, but of well distributed middle-class ownership capitulating to speculation and consolidation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, the local government hasn’t even bothered to measure the extent of this consolidation. The site <em>Inside Airbnb</em> and Athens-based activist groups have found more than twenty thousand short-term rental units not registered as such, thereby avoiding tax collection. While the noninterference of municipal governments suited the horizontalism of the antiparochi era, it now offers no protection from the takeover of Athens’s housing market by tech companies and foreign speculators. Athens could follow the lead of Amsterdam, Lisbon, Paris and Barcelona in taking steps to push units back into the residential market, reclaiming housing for long term residents. If the Athenian government fails to do so, it will return Athenians to a familiar situation: rule by faraway powerbrokers. This time, they will be oligarchs in Moscow, San Francisco, and Beijing rather than emperors.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t think I’ve ever</strong> stood outside the closed doors on Chestnut Street. I noticed how wide they are, how tall they are, how subtly red they are. Located between multiple iconic San Francisco landmarks—Lombard Street, Fisherman’s Wharf, North Beach, and Coit Tower—I was completely alone standing out front, waiting to be admitted to the San Francisco Art Institute for their 150th anniversary exhibition featuring the work of “disruptive” alumni, faculty, and staff. <a href=""https://sfai.edu/features/spirit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">“A Spirit of Disruption”</a> is an attempt to counter-write the narrative of Bay Area art history that has largely been white and male, by featuring a vast array of artists that have attended SFAI over its history.</p>

<p>The exhibition begins in the Diego Rivera Gallery, a San Francisco treasure, featuring the mural <em>The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City,</em> which equates art-making to industrial work, evocative of Rivera’s politics.

This first room contains more historical works, such as Henry Yoshitaka Kiyama’s comics about the racism experienced by Japanese immigrants in San Francisco in the early twentieth century, David Johnson’s black and white photographs of the March on Washington in 1963, and an array of paintings and photographs by and of Florence ‘Flo’ Wysinger Allen, an “esteemed artist’s model” across the Bay Area, and artist in her own right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found the two vitrines in the center of the gallery, sunlight careening and reflecting off of them, to contain some of the most intriguing bits of archival history, especially some unexplained images featuring a deep-sea diver and a scantily-clad woman, waves breaking on the shore behind them. I’m caught still thinking about those images. Under examination, this careful selection of SFAI’s archive—a smattering of newspaper clippings, letters to and from Jeff Gunderson, exhibition pamphlets and publications, and a literal time capsule—reveals a secret and private world, usually unseen by the average outsider, like myself. Delving into the archive in this way is like overhearing a stranger’s conversation, missing the inside jokes and references but still being able to grasp the sentiments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Down the hallway, in the McBean Gallery, the exhibition switches from 20th to mostly 21st century work, featuring pieces from my personal favorites Mildred Howard, Jay DeFeo, and Ana Teresa Fernandez, as well as a new favorite, M Lamar. Upstairs, the exhibition concludes with a three-channel video installation, “Media in the Round,” featuring over two hundred multimedia artists. The tripartite format allows for multiple viewing at once, a buffet for the eyes and ears. Personally, this was what I came to see and spent most of my time on; SFAI has such a rich history of media art that has long inspired my own research.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I know of the video and media history is the long-standing narrative, and I was hungry to learn more about the diversity of the past and present. The exhibition delivers exactly that; however, the presentation of this moving image media is so consuming that it is practically impossible to take it all in. I focused my attention as best I could on the visuals on the far left, which projected a documentary-style work featuring George and Mike Kuchar, onto a large, curved screen. As for rest—primarily shorter, experimental videos—I can’t even say which ones I watched in particular, or preferred, for that matter. They were mostly records of performance with no credits or title screens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After my visit, I tried consulting the exhibition website, which provides in-depth information about all of the 2D works and sculptures, but found nothing more than a list of the media-in-the-round’s participating artists. Perusing the archival exhibition left me with the continuing feeling that I was an eavesdropper, hoping to be let in on the conversation.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Bukowski: A Life, The Centennial Edition<br>
by Neeli Cherkovski<br>
Black Sparrow Press, $18.95
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Conceivably, the story</strong> has been altered to fit the tune. It is a poem after all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">It was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street<br>
I used to get drunk<br>
And throw the radio through the window<br>
While it was playing, and, of course,<br>
It would break the glass in the window<br>
And the radio would sit there on the roof<br>
Still playing<br>
And I’d tell my woman,<br>
“Ah, what a marvelous radio!”<br>
(""A Radio With Guts,"" 1973)
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">And each time he gets drunk, out goes the radio together with the glass, and each time it lands on the neighboring roof, it’s “still playing— / a magic radio / a radio with guts.” How the notoriously broke Bukowski can afford to keep replacing windows, we’re not supposed to wonder. The poem ends with: “I used to sit in the window / and watch the sun shine all over that thing / while the music played.” If there’s a metaphoric significance to the radio, to the music, we’re not supposed to ask. Bukowski didn’t go for that kind of thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Armed with irony, silence, and sarcasm, “Hank,” as he was known to friends, would form a rugged body of working-class prose and poetry—boozing, brawling, fluttering in and out of dead-end jobs before settling down to work, betting on horses all the while—that veered sharply away from the renewed genteel tradition in literature of the postwar 1940s and “We-Like-Ike” 50s, of which the novelist Herbert Gold observed, “Indeed it is difficult not to live cautiously these days.” Bukowski, who lived most incautiously, wrote about men and women on the outs in sun-drenched Los Angeles from a distinctly sallow-tinged point of view. To honor the centennial of Bukowski’s birth last year, his long-time publisher Black Sparrow Press, whose original mission included putting and keeping him in print, invited San Francisco poet and biographer Neeli Cherkovski (<em>Whitman’s Wild Children, Ferlinghetti: A Biography) </em>to revisit his well-received 1993 portrait of the man he’d called a friend for three decades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cherkovski, a warm and reassuring presence on the page, recounts the works and days of the old “lowlife laureate” with intimate detail and the respect of a close friend. In the new preface, Cherkovski admits, “My bias is toward the positive aspects of my subject’s life, and I even figure personally throughout the book, which makes it feel at times like something of a memoir of my friendship with Bukowski.” But the book is impressive in its scope and its tone, striking a fine balance between memoir and critical biography. Cherkovski adds some perspective to certain episodes in the writer’s life—his tempestuous relationship with artist Linda King, for example—but rarely attempts to prettify the picture.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Soon</strong> after his birth in Andernach, Germany on August 16, 1920, to Henry Bukowski, an American doughboy, and Katherine Fett, the sister of a German who ran Henry’s favorite canteen, Henry Charles Bukowski arrived in Los Angeles, his father’s hometown. Here, in the mushrooming Jazz Age metropolis still scattered with oil derricks and open plots from the citrus groves of the east to the amusement piers of the west, and which Aldous Huxley called “The City of Dreadful Joy,” Bukowski grows up under the shadow of a moody and dissatisfied father. Drawing heavily on Bukowski’s semi-autobiographical novel <a href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ham-on-rye-charles-bukowski/1100609585""><em>Ham On Rye</em></a> (1982), its episodes cross-checked by Hank himself, a handful of remaining childhood friends, and Hank’s cousin Katherine Bukowski Woods, Neeli Cherkovski paints the portrait of an exacting, domineering father deeply insecure and threatened by the very existence of a son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hank never forgave his parents for what he considered their coarse selfishness, “over and over describing [them] as unfeeling people.” As a teenager, he takes refuge in books, working through the local public library’s variations of soppy sentimentality and melodrama until coming across the works of James T. Farrell, Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, William Saroyan, and Ernest Hemingway. Lewis’s <em>Main Street</em> in particular, with its utter stripping of pretenses, leaves a major imprint. In Sinclair’s <em>The Jungle,</em> Hank finds himself intrigued by the injustices it harangues. In <em>The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, </em>and his bleaker short stories, Hemingway offers Bukowski clear images of life devoid of bathos, of brutality stripped of sanctimony. In a world of petty lies and vanity, here is something <em>true</em>. “Writing offered a defense against the mundane world,” Cherkovski writes. “The books [Bukowski] read taught him that he had not given in to the norms of society, and was not diminished by his father’s cruelty.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a lonely graduation, Bukowski takes a job at the massive Art Deco Sears-Roebuck on Olympic Boulevard in Boyle Heights, and there discovers John Fante (the novelist he would idolize the most); moving on to the Downtown Public Library, he devours Dostoevsky and other titans. The department-sorting drudgery proves formative in his unrelenting assault on deadening, routinized work imposed by corporate structures and organization men. With the country’s entry into World War II, Hank becomes a political gadfly, nurturing a deep distrust for ideological “slavery” he later channels into his more mature works of poetry (particularly 1972’s “Law,” with its imagery of children, dogs, and cats hanging from trees because “it’s been authorized”). When he comes home one day to find the lawn strewn with the pages of his short stories (Henry’s doing), he leaves for good. Living a life that resembles Jack London’s character, Martin Eden, he’s on the road for nearly five years, rambling aimlessly about America with drawn out spells in St. Louis, New Orleans, and Philadelphia, in and out of flophouses and the occasional jail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Bukowski’s primary complaint against society,” Cherkovski writes, “[was] that people are frightened by social and economic conditions into accepting humiliation and defeat.” Unlike the Beats, with whom he’s frequently and incorrectly grouped, Bukowski’s dive into the lower depths of American society wasn’t driven by some quest for spiritual truth, or guided by any privileged notion of artistic freedom or conscious cultural iconoclasm, but was a practical, working-class endeavor through which he developed a humane and matter-of-fact understanding for the impoverished, broken down, and forgotten, especially in his eternal Los Angeles.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Having</strong> abandoned his callow ambition to be a “Great American Novelist” in the 1930s, and for decades devoted himself mostly to poetry published in obscure places, Bukowski returns to prose in the 1960s, when his bare-knuckle style and steadfast nonconformism made him an unexpected cultural hero in the flourishing underground press. His column “Notes of a Dirty Old Man” in LA’s <em>Open City,</em> and later the <em>Free Press, </em>gives him the room to fashion the persona of Henry Chinaski, enabling him to play the role of eternal outsider, buoyed both by his need to survive and the freedom to cover “whatever came to mind.” In 1966, John Martin, a thirty-something office-supply store manager and bibliophile, founded Black Sparrow Press largely for the purpose of publishing Bukowski, beginning with broadsides and later offering him a $100 monthly stipend that enabled Hank to quit his day-job at the post office. Legendarily, Martin sold his collection of D. H. Lawrence first editions to support his publishing venture, and Bukowski repaid his faith by turning in his first novel, <em>Post Office</em>, in a month’s time. While the man’s sheer output of both prose and poetry left behind a lot of slovenly work, this period marks the transition to Bukowski, novelist, an era where, after some three decades, he finally begins to show some mastery over his work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the creation of Henry Chinaski, Bukowski ushers in a hyper-realist counterpoint to Salinger’s slickened, posturing Holden Caulfield, the leading postwar literary rebel of the mainstream. But his bumper-sticker reputation as the bard of skid-row belies his literary ambitions and historical provenance: in Chinaski’s particular war against hypocrisy and America’s bankrupt morality, Charles Bukowski fuses the unflinching instincts of the novels of Dos Passos, Hemingway, and Knut Hamsun with the comical, cosmic humanity of Dostoevsky and Gogol to convey an unadulterated truth of circumstance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Book after book follows, some less distinguished than others, vaulting the “eternal outsider” to the status of “celebrity”—at least in Europe (by the end of the 1980s, he’s Germany’s most-published, most-read American author). Bukowski begins touring, reading to raucous, back-talking audiences who crave a good insult lobbed their way by the old man himself in between sips of beer and wine. Bukowski wrote poetry like a man possessed, using spare lyricism to evoke his private truth, in its most lucid and variegated form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Life, for Hank, was defined by moments of humanity, in love and laughter, or, more controversially, in virulent rage. According to film director Taylor Hackford, Bukowski “[enjoyed] creating emotionally pitched situations, all of it feeding into his art.” On a less favorable note, his work is littered with irredeemable characterizations of women. Critic Russell Harrison attempts to explain this tendency as “the phenomenon of a man whose deepest attitudes to women were shaped almost a half-century earlier than the era in which they were given artistic expression.” While there’s no outright excusing this behavior, Cherkovski’s dive into his three primary relationships: Linda King, Liza Williams, and Linda Lee Beighle, reveals a more tender side of the often insecure man grappling with the dueling flames of devotion and jealousy, spurred by bouts of heavy drinking. But Bukowski was conscious of the character he unleashed, and whether or not the schtick still sticks, the role of the brute was always more fiction than fact. It’s Henry Chinaski, the outcast of comical ugliness who breathes life into the streets and cramped rooms as “a hero, a fall guy, a comic character, a womanizing lush, a wise old dog.” No degradation is too far for a <em>character</em> to experience, suffering a modern and mechanical oppression. In this complicated yet distinctive vein, Bukowski takes a seat beside Louis-Ferdinand Céline and Henry Miller.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barbet Schroeder’s <em>Barfly</em>—starring Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway—arrives in 1987, “a mixture of palm trees and misery” as Hank puts it. Bukowski is a star. He publishes <em>Hollywood </em>in 1989, a novel depicting the whole behind-the-scenes account with the same lack of pretentiousness that defined his whole career. Molly Haskell of <em>The New York Times </em>calls it “a classic.” By then he’s settled into a house in San Pedro with wife Linda Lee, and the Miller beers and cheap red have been replaced by Heineken and fine wine. But his small, old radio keeps playing. “You know, famous or not famous, rich or poor, all I wanted was to write, and I did it.” “The sense of the Whitmanic man prevailed,” Cherkovski declares, “unattached to ideology, yet acutely aware of his own needs and desires and exactly where he stood in relationship to the life around him.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When I think of the essence of Charles Bukowski,” Neeli tells us, “I think of the day he met my partner Jesse Cabrera ... Hank took me aside and said, ‘I’m so glad you are with somebody, man.’ Linda had a room prepared, and there were fresh-cut flowers in a vase on the nightstand. None of this surprised me.” Hank fostered showmanship, rage, and bravado, sure, but all throughout his life he embodied courage, integrity, and compassion. Guts and music, you could say. He <em>endured.</em> Now that we are once again, for good or ill, living in an age of ideology, there’s something to be said for that bit-by-the-teeth composure: “still alive, / poor but strong, / knowing Haydn at 4:30 a.m., / … this good night / is still everywhere.”</p>

1176,Redentore,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Il Chiesa del Santissimo Redentore</strong>, designed by the Venetian genius Andrea Palladio in the late 16th century, was commissioned to mark the city’s deliverance from an onslaught of plague which killed 50,000 people, or one in every three Venetians. That number equates to Venice’s current population nearly 500 years later, now the only inhabitants of a city struck by a similarly relentless disease. Apparently not suffering, they rather seem to be enjoying Venice as it “should be.” With tourism banned, the piazzas feel airy and open, and the sounds of seagulls are no longer muffled by the babble of tourists. Yet this is the view not of a Venetian but rather of one wide-eyed foreigner who happened to gain access to the city in ways that might never again be possible—at least not until another bout of plague.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How rare indeed, having travelled thousands of miles across the Atlantic, to spend thirty minutes alone in Redentore, save for the kind woman at the ticket booth and the man who came to gather change and extinguish candles, and to remember that, behind the all too well-circulated images of the city and hordes of tourists, there are works that can make you feel alone: <em>present</em> such that the pressures of identity give way to a frightening blissfulness of feeling. Words fail to communicate the intensity of the deeply private, deeply cherished moments. Perhaps you’ve felt the same. But sitting in the nave, thinking as I sometimes do about architecture, the ongoing pandemic, or anything else, I realized, embarrassingly, that a word already existed for what I was experiencing during that especially beautiful late afternoon alone in an eerily empty Venice, a word at the heart of all meritorious works of art and architecture: <em>intimacy</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Like falling in love, bungee jumping, or getting a first tattoo, creative work (both the making and its encounter) is likewise full of these paralyzing critical moments, where one must cast aside potential consequences and take on risk.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">It seems these kinds of experiences are less under-acknowledged and more avoided when speaking or writing about art or architecture. It is as if the potency of such experiences is too precious to name, like taming a wild animal, and the concurrent admittance of architecture’s requisite vulnerability is simply too personal to bear. To be intimate is to be vulnerable, after all. I am sure most artists can sympathize. As with public speaking, there is the fear of being exposed or more simply of looking stupid: easy enough to mask with rhetoric and ideas, yet always exceedingly obvious to the initiated. Or too there exists the fear of intimacy for its own sake, even in those most private of circumstances, where one must accept the malleability and transience of one’s very own identity. Like falling in love, bungee jumping, or getting a first tattoo, creative work (both the making and its encounter) is likewise full of these paralyzing critical moments, where one must cast aside potential consequences and take on risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Likewise, art and architecture’s requisite sensitivity is anathema to the clockwork of ordinary, utilitarian life. I am reminded of some <a href=""https://www.ubu.com/film/guston.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">words</a> by John Cage: “When you start working everybody is in your studio—the past, your friends, enemies, the art world, and above all, your own ideas—all are there. But as you continue painting, they start leaving, one by one, and you are left completely alone. Then, if you are lucky, even you leave.” John Cage was no painter, but as a composer he surely understood the risks and demands of creativity's necessary solitude. I would argue such solitude is required of architecture as well, and that good architecture is always more than the sum of clear influences and criticisms, instead finding its greatest purpose and meaning in ambiguity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps such sincerity is old hat. Or maybe I’m a hopeless romantic (this was Venice, after all). Following my visit to Redentore, I took a boat to San Giorgio, another Palladian masterpiece nearby, hoping again to have a few private moments in a great work of architecture. After disembarking and entering the church, I found to my horror, blocking the view of the altar, an enormous aluminum construction akin to a ziggurat, 50-feet tall and shoddily bolted together, ruining the overall experience of the architecture in ways that can only be described as criminal. A description of the installation, by the (appropriately named) artist Not Vital, <a href=""https://ropac.net/news/492-not-vital-biennale-architettura-2021/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">reads</a> as follows:</p>

<p class=""indented"">To paraphrase a colleague, one can envision the opening reception where such a description might be read, accompanied by the approving nods of semi-interested listeners. That is why I was in Venice, after all: to attend the ceremonies and receptions around this year's Venice Biennale of Architecture. Or yet, one could quickly understand that such a work was never made to be seen in person (or occupied, as its doors and central staircase were off limits), but rather documented to be published on Instagram or in an upcoming exhibition catalogue. Not that many people apparently care. In the weeks and months leading up to the biennale, I had heard less of great works to be seen in the Giardini or Arsenale and more of the (admittedly delicious) Venetian culinary specialties, of opportunities to catch up with colleagues, and of the parties and panels that were now to be postponed until the late summer. Ironically, to see great architecture, I was told that I would need to leave the exhibition grounds and venture elsewhere, which had brought me that day across the lagoon to Redentore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As experienced by me literally in San Giorgio and figuratively elsewhere in this year’s biennale, rhetoric curtails aesthetic experience. One might think that this year’s subdued opening would provide an opportunity for otherwise, yet throughout the biennale, one’s attention is flooded by a torrent of QR codes, wall texts, and proclamations absent much work of formal interest. In the Spanish Pavilion, such sentiments take material form as thousands of suspended sheets of text seem to fall from the sky, blocking one’s ability to inhabit the space of the pavilion’s central gallery. Elsewhere in the Giardini, pages from a publication were transferred to panels and mounted on the gallery’s walls, forming a monotonous display of otherwise compelling material in a strangely darkened basement space. Inversely, Germany seems to have forfeited its participation in the biennale altogether, opting instead to keep its pavilion completely empty except for a lone QR code in each gallery. Though I did not scan those codes, at least their beautiful pavilion was not cluttered with yet another interesting monstrosity, as I would discover in San Giorgio days later. Better to be damned if you didn’t than if you did—there is at least some consolation in that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For sure there are gems in the vast roughness of the biennale. It was an extraordinary surprise to see five space gloves worn by NASA astronauts on display near the entrance of the Arsenale, brought to Venice by Nicolas de Monchaux. A woven carbon-fiber pavilion, supported by one of the Arsenale’s massive stone columns, was a similarly refreshing break from the overall flatness of the other installations. Not that this is necessarily the fault of the biennale or its director Hashim Sarkis. The overreliance on well-intentioned rhetoric and downright disavowal of sincere formal experimentation—of making actual architecture—is too widespread to be pinned on any one source. If the biennale is above all meant to be a cross-section of the discipline, Sarkis appears to have allowed for that, aesthetic consequences be damned.</p>

<p class=""indented"">At least the after party was nice and the weather was mild. After a few Spritzes, I forgot all about architecture and the biennale as we turned our attention to the nearby restaurant where we had dinner reservations. I had cuttlefish with polenta and a really good white wine I cannot now remember, followed by the obligatory shots of limoncello before we all ventured through San Marco back to our apartment for more drinks. Hours later, lying in bed half-drunk, I jotted down a now semi-embarrassing thought: ""the intimacy of architecture has been surmounted by sociability."" I also remembered those proclamatory words of Susan Sontag, published amidst the societal upheavals of the 1960s: “Against a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art.” By morning, having again forgotten all about this, I sat for an espresso, watching the locals leisurely go about their workday before catching a boat toward the other side of the lagoon.</p>

<p><strong>Folsom Lake was built</strong> at the confluence of the north and middle forks of the American River in the 1950s. Since then, it has functioned as a tool for flood mitigation, hydroelectricity, and recreation. It was to be a place of suburban luxury to the east of Sacramento, a haven from the heavy heat of a central valley summer. Today, Folsom Lake is at its lowest since its creation, with boaters no longer allowed on the reservoir due to the water level.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This summer, I stepped out of my car into the soft breeze, scanning the bright horizon of Beal’s Point at Folsom Lake. A couple cars were parked in small pockets of shade beside young sycamores. Few people walked on the cement path coated in the midday sun. A family sat on top of a picnic bench, enjoying a small patch of shade on the green irrigated lawn. As I walked the cement path, I saw two large lifeguard posts standing in front of a dry and long meadow. I imagined what this inlet must’ve looked like in other years—the water high to the shore, kids playing in the shallows as others sunbathed. But the water was gone, the land renewed into an open expanse of sand, grasses, and shrubs growing in place of the once submerged land. Beyond the meadow and open rock-beds surrounded by plants clinging to dry earth, I saw, far in the distance, the patchwork of islands made in the depleting reservoir that is Folsom Lake. I was looking at a man-made pool, returning to rock and grass, becoming, once again, two forks of the American River.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Dams are monumentally tragic in the minds of conservationists. In the building of a dam, entire habitats and ecosystems disappear under its hold. As John McPhee writes in <em>Encounters with the Archdruid </em>(his book about the prominent conservationist David Brower), a dam is a “disproportionately and metaphysically sinister” problem for conservationists. “The conservation movement is a mystical and religious force,” McPhee writes, “and possibly the reaction to dams is so violent because rivers are the ultimate metaphors of existence, and dams destroy rivers. Humiliating nature, a dam is evil—placed and solid.”</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>These landscapes seem destined to return to what they were before central California was transformed into, what conservationists might call, drowned cathedrals.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">On the utilitarian side, however, these dams have enabled fruitful farming in many areas of the country. The Bureau of Reclamation, signed into being by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, helped create dams in order to provide more water to settlements in the American West. Today, the dams built under this department have become essential for the lives of millions. In California, for example, eighty-two percent of water used by the public comes from reservoirs, rivers, and other surface water stores across the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nevertheless, due to climate change, the lands beneath these reservoirs are returning to the surface. Dams in California are becoming barren walls, holding back what little water remains in the midst of one of the worst droughts in history. These landscapes seem destined to return to what they were before central California was transformed into, what conservationists might call, drowned cathedrals.</p>

<p>Before Folsom Lake was constructed, there was a small community called Mormon Island living by the shores of the American River. Before Mormon Island, these shores were fertile land for many indigenous peoples. The Miwok people to the east, the Patwin, the Wintun, and the Wintu people to the west, all called the river Mokelumne, or Condor River. Today, as the water reaches historical lows, the forgotten foundations of Mormon Island have resurfaced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This land has been transformed by the flowing of the river, the cultivation of native plants by Miwok and Wintun people, the western colonizers introducing invasive plants, federal interests attempting to create more sustainable energy systems and water storage in dry lands, and, by the climate crisis. Yet ecologically, change should be thought of as a constant. The only thing that seems to matter today is how we decide to move with that change: to keep the dams; to build more and preserve whatever water is left in the drying West as Floyd Dominy, the man who commissioned Lake Powell, might have done; or to monkey wrench them all, letting the water run to the Pacific as in the dreams of Edward Abbey.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I decided to walk further into the lake bed, seeing two bright parasols beside the distant lake shore.&nbsp;I could see the water in the rocks, curling currents over decades carving slowly through the bedrock, solid earth worn into sand and dust. Thick coyote bushes made their claim on the dry soil bed, clinging to the earth. Small grass-like plants with thick casings—perhaps evolved&nbsp;not to lose water in the heat—had returned. Boulders protruded like the thumbs of giants from the ground. I could see the markings of water everywhere on the land. But the water wasn’t there.</p>

<p><strong>After a yearlong hiatus</strong>, the Neutra VDL&nbsp;House is luring visitors back with an array of new, site-specific artifacts against the backdrop of its storied setting. Neutra VDL Studio and Residences is a national historic landmark and house museum located in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. Initially conceived by legendary architect Richard Neutra in 1932 as a space for his artistic practice, it continues to serve as grounds for experimentation and creativity in the field of architecture for current and future generations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The space expands upon its scenic appeal in “Built In,” an exhibition of recent works by 32 Los Angeles-based artists, designers, architects, and creative practitioners. These works, curated by artist and writer Erik Benjamins and local gallery Marta, were all created in 2021 and are inspired by Neutra VDL's numerous structures. Built-ins, such as cabinetry, shelves, and benches that cannot be removed, provide a glimpse into the personality and desires of a home’s original owners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":1210,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Marta_Built-In_Install-3-1.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1210""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">With its rich architectural history, the house provides an intimate—and culturally significant—setting for these modern-day artists to display their own creative offerings. These works, a complementary mixture of modern and vintage, breathe new life into the space. Easily overlooked household elements such as lamps, curtains, and pots elegantly accentuate the built-ins, underscoring Neutra’s attention to domestic detail.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the first floor, a series of clay pots by Candice and Darren Romanelli, titled <em>Campbell’s</em> and inlaid with hand-painted Campbell’s Soup brand imagery, are scattered about an outdoor platform. Placed within the ivy strewn deck of the house’s courtyard is<em> The Frank Lucian Neutra Memorial Bench</em>. Made from plywood and laminate by TOLO architecture, this bench is a tribute to Frank Lucian Neutra, the eldest of Richard and Dione Neutra’s three sons, who suffered from emotional and cognitive difficulties throughout his life. Serving as a place of reflection and commemoration, the bench rests close to Frank’s ashes and is adjacent to the Nuetra Family bronze plaque.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Other pieces include Jason Lipeles &amp; Janet Solval’s Stack Piece series, which speaks to the romantic relationship between Richard and Dione Neutra. What appears as an ordinary bar of soap perched on the kitchen sink is, upon closer inspection, a sculpture titled <em>All Senses</em>—inscribed with the words “Dione plays the cello – Richard listens”.&nbsp; In<em> I Have Recurring Visions of Us</em>, a stack of poems has been cut to fit the peculiar dimensions of a built-in shelf in the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While roaming throughout the home’s three stories, the viewer may be surprised to encounter an array of interactive, sensory installations including visual, auditory, and even olfactory augmentations. Having researched Neutra’s propensity for scent and sensation, Emily Endo offers a twist on how we experience aroma molecules<em> </em>in a 3-piece series (<em>Nature Near, Life and Shape</em>, and <em>From Floor to Clouds</em>). Glowing, honey-colored micro vials are nestled like jewels within translucent bowls. These vials are filled with fragrances Endo crafted with specific consideration to each floor (such as&nbsp;aluminum, elm leaves, and white stone for the first floor). The vials are free for the taking to all visitors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the second-floor patio, we come across <em>Song of Saint James II</em>, a fountain by Charlap Hyman &amp; Herrer that offers both visual and sonic elements. Centered within the frame of a stone-filled reflection pool, a cylindrical base—designed in reference to a piano leg crafted by Nuetra himself and located on the ground floor—sustains a large clamshell from which water gently cascades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sound installation by Jeremiah Chiu, titled <em>Dione and Her Own Space</em><strong>, </strong>is situated on the top floor. A musical arrangement is played on a continuous loop, composed of layers of Dione Neutra’s voice, combined with a musical performance of hers from 1976, intertwined with field recordings of the home’s construction and local street noise from the era.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Such touches communicate the intrinsic spirit of the Richard and Dion Neutra VDL Research House II, which paradoxically entrances with its timeless serenity and attempts to connect with its history and its creators. Guests will want to leave behind their daily concerns and surrender to the serene environment this unique exhibition provides.</p>

<p><strong>After nearly a decade </strong>of work—including four years of delays—the <a href=""https://www.academymuseum.org/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Academy Museum of Motion Pictures</a> opened September 30th in Albert C. Martin's gleaming May Company Building (now the Saban Building), the streamline moderne masterpiece at the corner of Fairfax and Wilshire in the Miracle Mile District. The museum’s stated mission is “to advance the understanding, celebration, and preservation of cinema through dynamic and accessible exhibitions, screenings, programs, initiatives, and collections,” and it has five floors to do it in, along with the Ted Mann Theater in the basement and Renzo Piano’s globular 1000-seat David Geffen Theater—already affectionately known to Angelenos as the “Death Star” (which Piano is <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-09-29/academy-museum-architect-renzo-piano-talks-bubble"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">begging people not to call it</a>). Steeped in its own sense of history and hopes for the future, the Academy Museum has the potential to be a beacon for the artform—if it can just own its place in the culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The museum’s current feature attraction, “Stories of Cinema,” utilizing three of the museum’s floors, commences in the dark, myriad-monitored Spielberg Family Gallery, situated within the Sidney Poitier Grand Lobby. With this exhibit, the curators have attempted to address the industry’s difficult history of exclusionary tactics and its perpetuation of damaging stereotypes by ensuring that practically every reel projects a constant stream of images representative of the diversity of humankind captured on film over the many decades. While celebrating much of the Hollywood canon, they’ve also tried to confront more challenging topics, like Native Americans in Westerns, for example, as well as saving some room for foreign artists (i.e. artists who worked outside of the American market like Pedro Almodovar, Hayao Miyazaki) that have played a part in moving the story of cinema forward. Some have applauded the curation, some have not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The exhibition might have been a bit more intuitive to maneuver, but, eventually you succumb to a sort of self-directed, non-linear approach that is also right in line with the cultural climate of our day. The second floor’s six rotating galleries, dedicated to spotlighting significant films and filmmakers, features multi-dimensional looks at<em> Citizen Kane </em>(1941), martial arts actor Bruce Lee, pioneering Black writer-actor-filmmaker Oscar Micheaux, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and <em>Real Women Have Curves</em> (2002), through an array of video, audio, and physical artifacts (Herman Mankiewicz and Orson Welles’s bound <em>Kane </em>shooting script, Micheaux’s autobiographical novel <em>The Homesteader</em>,<em> </em>Polaroids of Boyle Heights taken by the location scouts for <em>Real Women Have Curves</em>).</p>

<p class=""indented"">Two rooms are dedicated to the Academy Awards themselves in a rather cringey stretch of museum space, although a piece from 1929’s inaugural awards show (held at the bewitching Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, a place with a <em>very</em> lively history) is a treat. Spike Lee is highlighted in an installation titled “Director’s Inspiration, ” which brings the indefatigable filmmaker’s vibrant world to life through all the various cultural productions (art, films, music, personalities) that helped inform his particular filmic sensibility; then turn a corner and experience <em>everything </em>related to 1939’s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, (“the ultimate film about Hollywood” if you believe film critic Mick LaSalle)—right down to the ruby slippers—in an installation dubbed “The Art of Moviemaking.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">Personally, I was more captivated by the walkthrough of smaller installations dedicated to such topics as Story (where drafts of <em>Chinatown</em> sit next to storyboard sketches for <em>Psycho</em> alongside its screenwriter Joseph Stefano’s hulking Olympia typewriter), Performance (the integral relationship between casting and acting—with Polaroids galore), Image (a spotlight on production designers, set decorators, location managers, and cinematographers), plus Sound, Costume Design, Makeup and Hairstyling, all bringing viewers more intimately in touch with the minutiae of “making a movie.” It’s like staying for the credits and watching the whole roll come to life.</p>

<p class=""indented"">The magic of this place lies in the materiality, the physicality and rigor of filmmaking that the everyday moviegoer becomes exposed to, along with the small nation of individuals who regularly labor together for months—even years—at a time to create something inspiring and provoking and, above all, entertaining. I will admit that with so much material (all the monitors in particular) the experience can become overwhelming. To do it all justice takes multiple visits, and that’s something I think these displays deserve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the third floor, Pedro Almodóvar’s vivid installation (an arrangement of thematic linchpins curated by the director himself) is worth hours on its own. Elsewhere, installations for Animation and Special Effects, and a wing dedicated to “Inventing Worlds and Character”—or how illustrators, directors, designers, and technicians transport us into imagined worlds—bring together the delightfully creative and imaginative aspects of film history. Who would have thought Thumper teaching Bambi to skate on ice almost didn’t make the final cut?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of my favorite exhibitions—of any museum— “The Path to Cinema: Highlights from the Richard Balzer Collection,” explores the fascinating predecessors to all of this visual titillation we take so much for granted today, from shadow puppet play to peep shows to zoetropes and praxinoscopes. Reels from the Lumière Brothers’ early footage of cities and exotic locales run in one corner (I was astounded watching mules cross a slough in Guadalajara in the 1890s), imparting an uncanny and wondrous sensation of the past rendered animate, like spying on history. Balzer, an author and documentary photographer, collected more than 9,000 pre-cinema artifacts from Europe, Asia, and Africa dating as far back as the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Its preservation and display is a true privilege, in the humbling (not nefarious) sense of the word.</p>

<p class=""indented"">A museum devoted to cinema this comprehensive has been sorely missing on the Pacific coast. And while it won’t please everyone when it comes to curating subjects as entrenched in cataloguing the human experience as film, one thing is certain: We’re better off that it’s here, if only as a reminder that a way of making, seeing, and experiencing motion pictures grew and evolved and produced so much in so (relatively) short a time, leaving a lasting mark on the imagination of billions. My hope is, despite the current insistence on global perspectives, it does not become the overt concern of the Academy to slight its examinations of Hollywood in favor of subjects outside its general purview, and continues to provide searching looks into the intricacies of our own complex industrial art, striking the right balance between commemoration and investigation. Given the explosively lucrative marriage of Silicon Valley and Hollywood, who knows what the future of visual storytelling holds? The only surviving shark mold from <em>Jaws,</em> anyone?</p>

<p><br><strong>On a misty afternoon</strong> last year I walked into Alan Dreyfuss’s loft in Emeryville. The ceilings were&nbsp; twenty feet high. Two bicycles were hung from ropes fixed to the ceiling with pulleys, a simple yet beautiful design. Beside the bikes was a wall of books, complete with an old wooden ladder to reach the highest shelves. He walked over to his small kitchen, opened two beers and handed me one. Dreyfuss, a short man with large wrinkled hands worn from years of building and a quiet yet sure voice, stood for a moment as we sipped our beer, at peace with the pause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dreyfuss was twenty-one when he enrolled in Sim Van Der Ryn and Jim Campe’s new class, “Making a Place in the Country.” The son of an architect, he went to Berkeley to follow in his father’s footsteps. It was there that the psychedelic age of the 1960s had birthed many protests and new ideas and a deep-seated hope for a better world. While Dreyfuss, like many, participated in these experiments and protests, his own form of questioning came from wanting to do things for himself—to have the practical knowledge to live in any situation. For Dreyfuss, this meant not being tied down by money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I didn't want to get trapped,” Dreyfuss said, “trapped into the cycle of, ‘I have to make money in order to pay people to make a life for me. If I can do everything, I can live on no money.’”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was then he learned of “Making a Place in the Country.” The class catalogue said students would learn to build and design a community on a property in Marin County. He thought, “Oh, this is definitely what I want to do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The</strong> property was at the top of a small mountain between the oyster farms of Tomales Bay and the coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore. The land, covered in densely mixed forest of Bishop pine, coast live oak, and bay laurel, was accessible only via a small and extremely steep road. This was Van Der Ryn and his young family’s new home. They acquired the land just after Van Der Ryn and Campe finished teaching a course that guided public school students in redesigning their own classrooms. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was great until some of the kids started a rock band,” Campe said, laughing about one such class taught in the basement of Lawrence Hall. “It was too loud and we got kicked out of the building.” Pleased with the results of this student-driven class, they decided to scale up on this idea—not only conceptualizing but actually building a new communal space. Together, they agreed the course would gather to collectively create the buildings they believed necessary for a community. After the main structures were built, each student was tasked with making their own living space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>The class became not only a way for students to reimagine how one could and should build a home, but also a means to reconsider the pedagogy of traditional architecture.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">According to Campe, the school didn’t want to push forward with the class, since it was off campus and didn’t have any documentation that the school could point to, or potentially scrutinize. So Campe and Van Der Ryn decided that students were required to keep journals and take photos while they were there. At the end of the course, they would teach another class that would create a small booklet, which became <em>Outlaw Building News,</em> and a film about the experience, and give a public lecture. The administration agreed, and the class was offered for the following fall semester.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All this was antithetical to mainstream practice in architecture schools at the time, where modernist aesthetics and principles of designing to code took precedence over collaborative and playful experimentation. The class became not only a way for students to reimagine how one could and should build a home, but also a means to reconsider the pedagogy of traditional architecture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the course of ten weeks, many students commuted back and forth from the property to their other classes and jobs. In the city, some scavenged from factories and woodshops, finding what they could to bring back to their ephemeral home on the hill. Others, like Dreyfuss, ended up spending most of their time there, rarely commuting back to their homes in Berkeley.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The common space was built first along with the outhouse and the kitchen, which took around a week or so, the students camping out as they built. The common space, later known as the Ark, was reimagined constantly through the course.&nbsp;It became a place of tension in the class as students argued over both aesthetics and intention, settling to build sections as they pleased, disregarding any attempt to create an aesthetically, functionally, or communally cohesive space. While these sorts of disagreements permeated the course, they didn’t infringe on the effectiveness of the class. It was all an experiment, and anything, even radical reimaginings, were widely welcomed by Van Der Ryn.</p>

Kent California Room, Marin County Free Library.</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Once the communal buildings were mostly complete, Dreyfuss spent his days building what would become a small cabin with an open skylight roof and a glass wall. He sourced the glass from a shop that made shower windows, and some of the wood he salvaged from the property itself. Using the class as a lab, many of the students were encouraged to acquire their building materials anywhere they could in order to reconsider, without concern for building codes, or the hows and whys of their task. Van Der Ryn and Campe called this ethic ""Outlaw Building.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stewart Meyer, now a design-builder based in San Diego, built a teepee using aspen he gathered on a road trip up to Northern California. Another student built a small teahouse without walls out of used corrugated plastic and bay laurel poles. Someone else, using a large rope, built a hanging bed frame in a tree. Another student built what they called an “Intricate Space Station,” replete with geometric sidings at a width of around five feet. The image, along with its text questioning the ethics of using gravity in a zero gravity space, makes it hard to tell if anyone actually used this space, or if it was entirely sculptural.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Since</strong> there was no explicit teacher-student dynamic, it is hard to gauge what precisely happened in the class and when. Any notion of formality, even a sort of systematized information gathering, was thrown to the side. Looking at <em>Outlaw Building News</em>, each page, while focusing on a particular student, rarely, if ever, mentions those students’ names.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":1342,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_8548-scaled.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1342""/><figcaption>from <em>Outlaw Building News</em>, courtesy of the author</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Gail Morrison, one of the students named, writes, “The notion of ‘recording changes’ implies observing and chronicling something in discrete bursts of progress, but it was all a continuous process. Or numerous simultaneous processes, which is even harder to sort out.” Or, as Dreyfuss said of his time in the class, “I didn’t know what the fuck was going on. I was just having a good time.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Outlaw Building News </em>evokes the course as pure idealism—students, lovely and lost in the hills, gaining both practical and spiritual value from the experience of learning to build a home in the country. The introduction reads, “We grew under the sky rather than under a ceiling. We worked to the sounds of nature, rather than the hum of fluorescent lights.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Van Der Ryn and Campe’s hands-off approach is abundantly clear in <em>Outlaw Building News, </em>and the accompanying film they made. The class was never about a particular end result, like learning proper carpentry techniques, rather it was about the process of experimentation, letting students loose with their imaginations in the hopes that the experience would guide them to think more openly about the world of architecture and building.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>“The point of it wasn’t that maybe everyone in the world would end up living in a back-to-the-land commune… Even saying that all the back-to-the-land communes failed—that’s not actually an accurate critique of their success.""</p><cite>Greg Castillo</cite></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The intention of Outlaw Building was never to run away from the city or civilization, like many back-to-the-landers of the day, but rather a way to experiment with better alternatives for both urban and rural areas. Yet some, like Gail Morrison, now a city planner, questioned the outlaw ethics behind the class. She believed the experimental, freeform methodology neglected the importance of a rapidly urbanizing world. In <em>Outlaw Building News </em>Morrison describes the class as “a highly unusual and unrealistic case in terms of the great outside world… My social conscience tells me that I’m playing elitist games, and ought instead to be doing something more useful with anything I get out of this crazy school… A few manage to escape to the country, but what do you do with everyone else? Just leave ‘em there to choke on each other?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Architectural historian Greg Castillo, pushing back on this critique, says this negates the radical, non-success driven approach of the class.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The point of it wasn’t that maybe everyone in the world would end up living in a back-to-the-land commune… Even saying that all the back-to-the-land communes failed—that’s not actually an accurate critique of their success. [That’s] a corporate capitalist critique.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I brought up the question to Dreyfuss, he paused for a moment. While the class allowed him and others to grow as individuals, the outlaw building which the class espoused was not the most helpful method to consider the larger problems surrounding sustainability and efficient design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m not sure it is the real solution because I don’t think that the vast majority of people want to live that way,” Dreyfuss said, “There is nothing applicable on a large scale. We [built] sustainably because we didn’t build with new stuff.” Furthermore, to hold such a high aspiration for a single semester-long undergraduate course neglects the fact this was, after all, a class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While full of many aspirations for the course itself, there was little expectation beyond building and learning as a group. But for some, like Dreyfuss, the experience helped shape their lives. The class catalyzed Dreyfuss’s interest in building itself. Once he left the property, he worked for a young design-build business his friends started called Metamorphosis. After a few years of building, he decided to return to Berkeley to get his architect’s license, figuring his body could only take so much building. Eventually he landed at a consulting firm called WJE, from which he recently retired. Now, he sits on the California Historical Building Board, writing legal code for the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the class appears to have been steeped in an idealism that is hard to grasp. With the rising price of tuition in schools, increasing disparities between the rich and the poor, houselessness an ever increasing issue, the ongoing pandemic, and the steadily intensifying effects of climate change apparent in every part of the world, it appears that this kind of experimentation is too slow for the needs of our contemporary crises. But is change even possible without these kinds of experimentations?</p>

<p><strong>The first few frames</strong> of Wes Anderson’s new film, <em>The French Dispatch</em>, show an unpeopled printing plant in action, with handsome cast iron machines ushering leaves of paper here and there across an airy factory to the rhythm of a locomotive-like Foley track. We are looking at a miniature model, one of Anderson’s calling cards, and it appears just long enough for production company credits to flash overtop, opening this intricately crafted and frantically paced period-piece fiction which profiles a staff of American expat writers and the midcentury France they fashioned for the benefit of their readership back home in Liberty, Kansas. The film is presented as distinct episodes in which “factual” articles of Anderson’s creation (about the magazine’s late editor, its homebase in France, a jailed painter, a student protest, and a kidnapping) are brought to life, with the equally fictitious author of each one leading us through their work.</p>

<p>Jean-Gabriel Périot’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du05iIuX8Os"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Returning to Reims (Fragments)</em></a>, which, like <em>The French Dispatch</em>, first appeared at last summer’s Cannes Film Festival, also constructs a version of France over the last century or so, with the sort of workers who are absent from Anderson’s printing plant making up the focus of Périot’s film. In it, excerpts (the title’s “fragments”) of the left sociologist Didier Eribon’s landmark 2009 book <em>Returning to Reims</em> are read in voice over and complemented by a masterful archival assemblage of classic film, agitprop reportage, and shaky firsthand footage to convincingly construct a telling of modern French history in which the miserable conditions of French workers and their political subjugation defy the country’s mythic charms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The French Dispatch</em> is playing in theaters worldwide and will be seen by millions, while, as of this writing, <em>Reims (Fragments) </em>will only have a limited domestic release in March 2022, though it might end up on a cinephile streaming service. The silver lining is that Eribon’s original book is <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/returning-reims"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">readily available</a> in an immensely readable English translation from MIT Press.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It</strong> is a testament to Anderson’s art that <em>The French Dispatch</em>, in its concern with the observing intellectual’s interpretation of the world around her, laced with parentheticals and sudden shifts in time and place, has more in common with the form of Eribon’s self-inquisitive social analysis of post-war France than its film adaptation. But Anderson also creates that very world into which he sends the likes of Herbsaint Sazerac (Owen Wilson) and J.K.L Berenson (Tilda Swinton), and in doing so he draws from the same fount of canonical French cinema that Périot does when he slices and dices scenes of Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo, Chris Marker, Jean-Luc Godard, and others to illustrate Eribon’s trenchant reflections on working class identity and power. Périot pairs Eribon’s account of his family moving from a single furnished room in town to a new concrete housing development with segments from Marker and Pierre Lhomme’s verité documentary <a href=""https://icarusfilms.com/if-mai"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Le Joli Mai</em></a>, an epic on the ground survey of an antsy France in the early 1960s. They document the mix of excitement, dread, and uncertainty surrounding the national transition that Eribon writes about personally, along with the degraded living conditions that preceded it. In <em>The French Dispatch</em>, an unromantic tour around town from Wilson’s Sazerac leads us through the same socio-spatial evolution, including a miniature model reference to the <a href=""https://youtu.be/5GhOAgUFt7w?t=57"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">demolition</a> of Paris’ Napoleon III-era food market for the Westfield Mall that stands today in its place.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Eribon’s book is also a memoir of growing up gay and intellectually-inclined in a particular working class milieu that vehemently despised these traits (a thread less explored in Périot’s film) and in the book’s epilogue, he writes about the importance of cultural references for fusing his personal experience and political analysis of the France that raised him:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">I understood that a project like this…could only succeed if it was mediated by, or perhaps filtered through, a wide set of cultural references: literary, theoretical, political, and so on. Such references help push your thinking along, they help you formulate what you have to say. But most importantly, they permit you to neutralize the emotional charge that might otherwise be too strong if you had to confront the ‘real’ without the help of an intervening screen.</p>

<!-- wp:columns -->
<div class=""wp-block-columns""><!-- wp:column {""width"":""100%""} -->
<div class=""wp-block-column"" style=""flex-basis:100%""><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Indeed Eribon in his book, like Périot in his film adaptation, wields like a flashlight myriad signifying references, be they cultural, as stated, or sensory or material, to light a path from the local to the universal. Anderson has done much the same in his 10 feature films, and never so mesmerizingly as in <em>The French Dispatch</em>. Uncannily, Eribon above lays out a fine formulation of the chief characteristic of Anderson’s style (a message mediated through exacting visual reference), followed by the common criticism that his style serves “to neutralize the emotional charge” of the message. But Eribon presents that effect as the intended outcome; emotions without a referential intermediary “might otherwise be too strong.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Is this where the chance utility of Eribon’s passage for understanding Anderson’s bewildering craft finds its limit? On the contrary, it is additionally useful: the “intervening screen” of his artistry, which stands between us and the stories his characters act out, neutralizes the force of facile (strong, or blunt) sentiments that other contemporary filmmakers of his renown aim at. Instead, Anderson’s visual style disorients traditional emotional dependencies in cinema, which can muddle our initial reception of his, but ultimately makes for a lasting attachment to the images that make it up: red tracksuits evincing fatherly love and neurosis in equal measure (<em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em>), fanciful pastries securing passage by prison guards and fascists (<em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>), or most recently, an assault of printed matter (maps, letters, manuscripts) flatly containing as much dynamism as the action to which it is apparently incidental.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">If filmmaking is a technical process that makes an emotional impact, politics is an emotional process that makes a technical impact. The politician’s campaign appeals to our intractable attitudes about the world around us while his term in office lets him tinker with the tangible, whether the environment, borders, or the populace’s welfare and safety. <em>Reims (Fragments)</em> emphasizes that the politicians of the French Left gradually abdicated their responsibility to synthesize and marshal the innate hope and despair of the oppressed and exploited. Instead they became enamored with technical reforms and theories of change that saw class identity as a friction to the proper functioning of modern society—or irrelevant at best. In the meantime, the nativist right sold a simple story that immigration was to blame for all that ailed the French worker, and soon private prejudices coalesced under slogans like “Two million unemployed is two million immigrants too many!” This was in the late 1970s, a decade after “French workers, immigrant workers, same boss, same struggle” was one rallying cry of the May 68 movement.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Anderson pays homage in his way to May 68, centering an episode of <em>The French Dispatch</em> on besuited students who kickstart a protest movement with partly carnal motivations and face off against authority over chess matches, all under the slogan “The children are grumpy.” In the historical analogue, their idealistic, hormonally spontaneous actions would be matched by a general strike of millions of French workers. Unlike the film’s other sections, this one, titled “Revisions to a Manifesto,” does not document a freshly crafted fiction as much as it leans on a popular, certainly picturesque, but ultimately <a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/neglected-history-may-68-uprising-france/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">omissive</a> narrative of a historic event. It does succeed on one level as an ode to Mavis Gallant’s telegraphic <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1968/09/21/the-events-in-may-a-paris-notebook-ii"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">reporting</a> on the protests in <em>The New Yorker, </em>with Frances McDormand convincingly infusing the terse glances, gestures, and actions of her Lucinda Krementz, covering the story, with a mixed-up air of skepticism and overriding admiration. Yet little she witnesses hints at the era’s fascinating and fraught interplay of student, worker, and authority interests any more thoughtfully than a distressing 2018 Gucci <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcSQcEn6b5s"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">ad campaign</a> exploiting the movement’s 50th anniversary. In the past, Anderson has been capable of richly transposing even the darkest days of history, but here, giving himself a scant 25 minutes to work with, he opts to print the legend, now that the fashions surrounding it carry as much weight as the facts that came before.</p>

<p class=""indented"">As told in the film’s first few minutes, <em>The French Dispatch </em>folded in 1975 following the death of its editor Arthur Howitzer, Jr, (Bill Murray). Could it have continued much longer otherwise, with world-shrinking tools like television and the internet in the offing, threatening to render it all redundant anyway? The startlingly humanist conclusion to the final, and supreme, episode of <em>The French Dispatch</em> brings a Black gay journalist in Jeffrey Wright’s Roebuck Wright to the sickbed of an immigrant chef by the name of Nescaffier (Steve Park) and suggests the answer is yes. Or rather, it suggests that the yearning and othering that send some far away from home, that incite inquiries into the capital-F Foreign, is not necessarily to be conquered, but rather fostered into an open, sympathetic slant on the world, one that will exist above and beyond its occasional articulation in letters home or columns of a thin magazine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And would the forces of globalization, some of which also trivialized the tradition of dispatch journalism, have further marginalized the oppressed in France, even absent the institutional Left’s capitulation and the opportunism of a despicable right wing revealed in <em>Reims (Fragments)</em>? Périot emphasizes the political failure that hides behind vague structural excuses when he concludes his film with a rousing crosscut of firsthand footage from the many progressive movements that march in towns and cities across France today. The sequence accelerates into an ecstatic cacophony of agitation and a cunning update of Eribon’s analysis: The people are all right, even in the face of an authoritarian swing at home and abroad—they’re only deprived of a deft hand to mesh their messages, an honest editor-in-chief to shrink the masthead and make space for the mundane and monumental alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Afterparties<br>
by Anthony Veasna So<br>
Ecco, $27.99
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>If the title</strong> <strong>of Anthony Veasna So</strong>’s debut collection of stories, <em>Afterparties</em>, is a way of thinking about the stories themselves, then the party, the main event that his Khmer American characters are leaving, is genocide. It’s an impossible departure. The Khmer Rouge’s rampage, which murdered millions of Cambodians from 1975 to 1979 and led So’s parents to California, haunts every character in the book. And as keen as they are to get away from the pain, to leave the party once and for all, trauma keeps them in remembered time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much has already been said about <em>Afterparties</em>. When So died of a drug overdose in December 2020, eight months before the book’s release, the <em>New York Times</em> set the tone with a heady obituary: “Anthony Veasna So, Author on the Brink of Stardom, Dies at 28.” The certainty of So’s celebrity, cut short by his death, has been ever-present since then. “Anthony Veasna So Knew He Was a Star” (Vulture). “A Young Literary Star Makes His Posthumous Debut With 'Afterparties'” (NPR). Even the <em>Times</em> came back for more: “A Rising Star’s Career Was Cut Short. His Impact Is Just Beginning.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not all of this limelight was preordained. So was good. So good he coaxed today’s literary establishment into realizing geniuses <em>might</em> be okay, but only if they’re not <em>white</em>. “His genius wasn’t subtle,” wrote Mark Krotov, the first to publish So’s stories at <em>n+1</em>, “it was a beautiful onrush.” Queer, second generation Khmer American, and raised by immigrants in Stockton, which one of his characters calls the “asshole of California,” So’s “genius” was his indifference to inheritance: Unbound by accepted ethnic and queer identities, his vision of Cambodian American life is unforgiving and his spare descriptions of gay desire make Garth Greenwell sound like E. L. James. From characters wrestling with legacies of Khmer Buddhism to the Communist regime to West Coast technologism, nothing was safe from his sardonic wit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We could do it on Buddha,” jokes Rithy in “The Monks.” He’s talking about cumming. “You wanna get me kicked out?” says the monk who’s masturbating with him. Until then, Rithy has been trying to honor the spirit of his recently deceased father by staying at the local wat. But all he’s doing are chores, and he’s sure the monks are using him (they didn’t like his dad). “All I want is some guidance,” Rithy says earlier. All he gets is a muddy truth that shows up again and again in <em>Afterparties</em>. “Look, traditions don’t gotta be logical,” a monk tells Rithy. “We aren’t home, so why the hell would anything make sense?”</p>

<p class=""indented"">Monks get another mocking in “The Shop.” Toby’s Cambodian dad owns an auto repair shop, but his kindness runs it into the ground (he won’t fire his bad “Cambo” workers and he gives too many discounts to “Cambo” folk). At one point Doctor Heng’s wife, who visits everyday and won’t shut up about her husband’s success in America, brings a statue of Buddha to boost the Shop’s karma. Soon the waiting room is overrun with Buddhas, but it’s not enough and monks are summoned for a last-ditch blessing. After marching in behind Doctor Heng’s wife,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">the monks walked around the Shop, examining the corners and crevices, sprinkling blessed water over the grease stained walls. When they finished the inspection, the monks lit their incense in every room, even the storage room, with those cases of flammable Mobil 5W-30. The aroma of burning flowers, I guessed, was supposed to create a force field that would thwart evil spirits while attracting customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Smoky like the incense he taunts, So’s wit is never malicious. It’s rooted in doubt, which his characters express in confessions of dislocation from the traditions they left in Cambodia. Contemporary America, less a land of the free, is a land free of spiritual belief, at least in the lives of So’s young protagonists—sexy, sarcastic millennials and Gen Zers—who only have their parents’ memories of a land where faith fortified the future, until it didn’t. “What had we done to deserve such violence?” asks Toby. “How terrible it must have been, our country and culture’s past karma.” Severed from the genocide that severed their parents from their homeland, So’s protagonists, like himself, can only wonder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“He talks about the genocide by telling it aslant,” Danny Thanh Nguyen wrote in a review for <em>GQ</em>, “focusing instead on the experiences of a new generation of Cambodian Americans, young adults raised and marked by those who survived catastrophe.” Helen Atsma, So’s editor at Ecco, voiced similar praise, in terms which are as much a celebration of So’s brilliance as they are a celebration of the freedom he had, as the queer son of refugees, to host the afterparty of atrocity. “The community that Anthony was writing about has been underrepresented in fiction,” Atsma told the <em>Times.</em> “This whole community is haunted by genocide, and yet you’re also laughing out loud when you’re reading some of these stories.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the hype of So’s death, Ecco, an imprint of empire (i.e., HarperCollins), printed a first run of 100,000 <em>Afterparties </em>and will release a second book of nonfiction in 2023. So’s agent, Rob McQuilkin, has downplayed the celebrity post mortem. “The notion that this book was helped in some ghoulish way by the absence of the author is in error,” he told the <em>Times</em>. But death is, inevitably, part of the story, and just as no one can deny that So was a gifted humorist—one of those rare storytellers like George Saunders or Lysley Tenorio who can tease laughter from the absurdities of human suffering—it’s impossible to ignore the market’s incessant appetite for famous dead artists. “Laughter permits man to prove his essential freedom,” wrote Hannah Arendt, “through a kind of serene superiority to his own failures."" Anthony Veasna So was as serene—and serenely profitable—as they come.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Wagnerism: Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music<br>
by Alex Ross<br>
Picador, $23.00
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Art and religion (they are the same thing in the end, of course) have given man the only happiness he has ever had.<br>
-Willa Cather
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>In the benign age</strong> <strong>of Cancel Culture</strong>, Alex Ross—that ever nuanced <em>New Yorker</em> music critic—has committed an irremediable sin. His <a href=""https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250800084/wagnerism"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Wagnerism</em> (New York: Picador, 2020)</a> has resurrected the very personality in European cultural history for whom the term “proto-fascist” was (probably) originally coined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be sure, over some 660 pages of vibrantly compelling text Ross does go out of his way, again and again, to reassure his reader that we should never ponder composer Richard Wagner (along with Wagnerism/ Wagnerianism/ Wagneritism /Wagnermania) without clucking over his multifarious “dark” sides. Unfortunately for our intrepid Cancelists, it really does not work, because by the time the attentive reader is done with Ross’s colossally long account, judging Wagner seems as pointless as measuring any primordial Force actualizing the Universe. Ultimately, we come back to the greatest phenomenon in that ongoing nineteenth century project, the “Religion of Art” (<em>Kunstreligion</em>), linking aesthetics and politics into a redemptive and transformative future for society, politics, economics—and, yes, religion (or if you will: “spirituality”). The driving question becomes rather: Even if we concur with each Wagnerian “transvaluation of values” (as acolyte Friedrich Nietzsche cribbed from his peculiar association with Wagner), is the result—whatever it may be—worth our concern? When compared to the all-devouring charms and conveniences of rampant digital technologization, for example?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>First and foremost then, one must return to the question already posed: What did the composer himself <em>want</em>?</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">For a start, we must unbundle what Wagner himself thought was the point of it all, and for this Ross’s punctilious narrative proves indispensable. Of course, Wagner studies are legion and many are even quite good, but Ross stands out for being both a sophisticated musicologist of European cultural history and a critic of modernist and postmodernist impulses, even unto the Age of Gen Z. There is no doubt that personally Ross “loves” Wagner: Already in college “I began to fall in love with Wagner;” experiencing Wagner’s <em>Ring</em> tetralogy went with “various crushes and love affairs” and even helped Ross in “recovering from alcoholism.” No wonder that Ross could finally proclaim: “Writing this book has been the great education of my life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, and still, no point to idealizing Wagner: “The ugliness of his racism” leaves a picture “cracked down the middle.” So where does that leave the moral integrity to Ross’s <em>own </em>professed “love”? One expiation is to stretch out pretty well every crush that any reasonably memorable cultural figure has undergone to the Wagnerian influence, and Ross admirably performs that daunting exorcism. Anywhere you might look on the cultural landscape, there spreads the Wagner virus. Just to mention those names to whom Ross devotes an extended account: Willa Cather, Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, Marcel Proust, Andrey Bely, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Thomas Mann, Sergei Eisenstein. Then there are the ample Wagnerians of the gender wars, the political left and right, not to forget the Nazi Wagnerians who deserve a special look and summation, plus creeping Wagnerian influences on aesthetic modernism and modern media, all the way to Hollywood and kindred digital institutions (Ross might also have mentioned installation art).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ross is unsparing when zeroing in on Wagner’s abysmal anti-Semitism. Even so, he will not be sucked into untested assumptions, especially those that automatically equate Wagner with Nazism. To take some examples, for Ross the jury is still out on whether Wagner’s characters are based on Jewish stereotypes, or that Wagner’s music was in fact played in the concentration/extermination camps. Indeed, Adolf Hitler for one does not seem to have ever taken advantage of citing Wagner’s anti-Semitic fulminations, nor was the Wagner family-controlled Bayreuth institution at any time actually affiliated with direct Nazi control—not that such separation absolves Bayreuth’s and widow Cosima Wagner’s own rampant anti-Semitism. Surprisingly perhaps, her own notes reveal a family often critical of repression of African minorities and of native cultures. Finally, there is plenty of evidence on behalf of vegetarianism, animal protection, and a quasi-pacifism critical of militarism and standing armies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One difficulty with making sense of such tumultuous evidence is the temptation to overlook distinctions between Wagner himself, the Bayreuth enterprise, and Wagnerism.&nbsp; This is common enough in all evaluations driven by the “anxiety of influence,” but particularly acute in this controversial case. Ross on Wagner himself would make up a functional volume by itself, but placed as it is within a project aiming to elaborate “a musician’s influence on non-musicians—resonances and reverberations of one art form into others,” it can often tempt the author to slide off his evaluation of the composer himself into the ramifications of Wagner’s impact on so many diverse zones of human conduct and ideology. First and foremost then, one must return to the question already posed: What did the composer himself <em>want</em>?</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Ross actually flirts with the correct answer when associating Wagner with the poet Friedrich Schiller’s ideal of an “aesthetic state” in German thought: “Romantic art-religion is bound to Hegel’s dialectic of progress, <em>creating an aesthetic juggernaut</em>.” Unfortunately, Ross seems unaware of an extensive work like <em>The Aesthetic State</em> (Berkeley, 1989) which plausibly demonstrates Wagner’s enterprise as forming an important, albeit not the prime, component in a German mission driving the utopian hopes of such otherwise disparate thinkers as G. W. F. Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Herbert Marcuse. Wagner’s own special contribution was to put to the test the making of such an aesthetic state in King Ludwig II’s Bavaria after he had formulated his own version in a series of radical prose works and libretti reflective of the European Revolutions of 1848-1849. Willingly serving that upheaval among the barricadeurs of the 1849 Dresden uprising, Wagner was to be subsequently hounded into the life of a wandering outlaw, the “Marat of Music,” pursued by European conservative courts right up to his later years. Indeed, having been miraculously saved from debtor’s prison by his No. 1 fan Ludwig, Wagner gathered into his Bavarian project some of the key figures making up the political left of mid-century European radicalism.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In assessing Wagner, one must always start with recognition that above all he was a <em>dramatist</em>, a child of theatre and theatricality, who unabashedly sought out the Renaissance goal of <em>dramma per musica</em>—“drama <em>through</em> music, <em>by means of</em> music” (following Joseph Kerman’s acute gloss)—which is what opera was supposed to emulate but which had often enough dissipated into mere entertainment and virtuoso singing. The rather tortuous argument in Wagner’s key theoretical text <em>Opera and Drama</em> (1852) countered this presumed corruption with an alternative based on the primacy of <em>tone</em> for a distinctly <em>human</em> evolution. Humanity was only “human” because of its capacity to express through the art of tone (<em>Tonkunst</em>) dance and song, whence emerged the redemptive phenomena of the folk song (<em>Volkslied</em>) and the loving couple. How that might be secured for the stage took up Wagner’s most frantic theoretical and “music-dramatic” experiments, all focused on the exploitation of that extended folk song, the Myth—German myth—that retained the phenomenological promise and assurance of what Wagner consistently used as his standard: “The purely human” (<em>das Reinmenschliche) </em>is saved and sustained by the human voice and the universal power of tonal modulation of the modern symphonic orchestra.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over time Wagner swung all the more acoustically to the metaphysical primacy of music—unlike all other art forms, the very expression of the universal Will, according to Wagner’s beloved philosopher Schopenhauer. But this adjustment remained subordinate to Wagner’s lasting theatrical message, which (if it might be squeezed into formulaic exactitude), mixed Dionysian-Christian and Buddhist elements of love and compassion to touch off in his audience a kind of <em>ecstatic tearfulness</em>. Wagner thought that this experience promised redemption for a society controlled by traditional repressive institutions but also by the rising domination of capital and money. At first he hoped that his theater would work hand in hand with revolutionary forces pushing socialist and even “communist” goals to end class society and inaugurate a world of common creativity (all men as “artists”). When those forces were soundly defeated, he took the lead with the promise of his own work wedging a domain of freedom into a primarily conservative epoch. It is true that ultimately Wagner’s project foundered in Ludwig’s Munich, but Wagner resourcefully shifted to founding his own special Theater to Art for pilgrimage and contemplation in the obscure Bavarian city of Bayreuth. From that Wagnerian <em>omphalos</em> have then permanently issued Ross’s hosts of Wagnerians and Wagnerites.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It remains to be seen whether Wagner’s professed aim of uniting “art and politics” (Ross’s subtitle is: “Art and Politics in the Shadow of Music”) carries any substantive impact today. For the ongoing project of Wagnerism, the Wagner critic will need to continually ask herself whether there still augurs a “utopian other”—as Wagner for one imagined—in the critical theatrical moments fashioned by Wagner for presumably “liberatory” purposes. At least one must be grateful that such practical acoustical and visual opportunities remain impressively available on the living performance landscape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter: in the end Alex Ross’s <em>Wagnerism</em> has bequeathed to Gen Z a truly Wagnerian Temple. Consecrated to “ce dieu Richard Wagner,” the Wagnerian Religion of Art—notwithstanding all the understandable hesitations, reactions, rejections toward it by skeptic and denigrator—may now continue to be, thanks to Alex Ross’s own meticulous Wagnerism, <em>worshiped</em>:</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Dream State: California in the Movies<br>
by Mick LaSalle<br>
Heyday, $28.00
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>THE FIRST RULE</strong> of California criticism: pull no punches. “California as a state of being is aspirational, envious, driving toward something, often literally, always figuratively, and, in some fundamental way, never, ever getting there.” So Mick LaSalle, stalwart film critic for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> since 1985, writes in his latest book, <em><a href=""https://www.heydaybooks.com/catalog/dream-state-california-in-the-movies/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Dream State: California in the Movies</a>,</em> an expansive survey of California filmography. Even amid praise, there’s always a small cruel streak to New Yorkers’ assessments of the “Golden State,” and frankly, I don’t always blame them. But curiously, although LaSalle has been a California native for over three decades, <em>Dream State</em>—his first book in nine years—reads a bit like a New Yorker's descent into the heart of darkness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having introduced himself with the requisite, all-caps-bold disclaimer “I GREW UP IN NEW YORK” and stated his purpose “[T]his is a book about two things, about the idea of California as depicted in the movies, and about California ideas that have made their way into the culture, through movies,” he declares: “<em>The Wizard of Oz</em> is a movie about Hollywood.” And he makes a strong case for it. While exploring Victor Fleming’s 1939 adaptation of L. Frank Baum’s pre-Hollywood (1900) novel, LaSalle unveils a mental blueprint to the Hollywood dream machine—from the guiding principles of wishful escape, fraudulence, deception, and deep, spiritual yearning, to the darker studio politics at MGM behind the production, and on to the creaky feel of the sets and the sweat-streaked faces of the overworked, ex-vaudevillians (Bert Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley) who play those unforgettable anthropomorphic renderings of misfits. With chilling, matter-of-fact efficacy, he renders—not only for the Oz story, but also the machinery that imposes itself like the backdrop of a big blue sky—the cloying desperation of it all to serve something vividly inspiring but, most importantly, lucrative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From there, LaSalle ventures into chapters that deal with some particular tendency endemic to the “California picture”: the sweet and cruel bird of youth; California as spiritual wasteland; wartime Hollywood (with its sausage-thumbed depictions of the Japanese); <em>noir</em> (“Real noir is California noir”); natural disaster (“Imagine if every other British film saw Big Ben and Parliament getting trashed… if Italy had the Leaning Tower finally toppling… Now imagine all these movies happening again and again, for a period of <em>years,</em>”) among others.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">What is impressive is that while interpreting film after film of droptop convertible wisdom—or ruin—LaSalle doesn’t play loose and easy with his task. He carries the same amount of dedication into each analysis. It’s just that <em>California</em> is a good bit narcissistic, and the Hollywood machine—full of more grasping transplants grappling with a crisis of too much self-love, self-loathing, or both—can’t stop riffing about itself, not with all that money to be made exporting its glory and pity. His breadth makes the book a breeze to read if you’re a film buff. On fame alone (where California’s Gold Rush jackpot mentality opposes New York conceptions of fame and success as something hard won)  he cites all of the following: <em>Flashdance, Michael Clayton, Ella Cinders, Dinner At Eight, A Star is Born </em>(all four versions<em> </em>and <em>What Price Hollywood?</em>)<em>, The Bad and the Beautiful, Ingrid Goes West, La La Land, Sunset Boulevard, Behind the Candelabra, Hardcore, Boogie Nights, </em>and the inside-Hollywood sleeper<em> Frances</em>, lingering over a few or merely noticing others<em>. </em>Spanning the Jazz Age to Trump Americana, the earliest, <em>Ella Cinders</em>, is from 1926, the latest, <em>Ingrid Goes West</em> from 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, with so much on spiritual sickness, reinvention to the point of criminality, facile and flaccid notions of selfhood, etc., you’d be forgiven for a creeping sense that LaSalle hasn’t shaken his belief in New York as the nation’s True North from whence all children have strayed. I’m reminded of Shane Black’s underappreciated Los Angeles buddy cop comedy <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </em>(2005), and I’ll go so far as to venture much of LaSalle’s lucid prose is devoted to a book-length expansion on Robert Downey, Jr.,’s unstoppably charismatic second-rate New York petty criminal Harry Lockhart’s proclamation: “I mean it’s literally like someone took America by the East Coast and shook it, and all the normal [people] managed to hang on.”</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It’s</strong> always nice when a New Yorker opens up to you, maybe in some dimly lit bar somewhere in LA that wouldn't look out of place in Robert Altman's 1974 <em>California Split,</em> with <em>the straight dope. </em>In <em>Dream State,</em> LaSalle saves a head full of steam for the book’s final three chapters: Noir. Disasters. Utopias. And it’s in the final chapter, on the subject of that very Californian strain of utopia, “the Sixties,” that LaSalle picks up on something Hollywood was into before Silicon Valley: the death of history and the end of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ever since the advent of photography in the 1840s, LaSalle posits, history began to exist in black-and-white, and at a certain point the world of black-and-white began to signify something stilted, something <em>rooted</em> in time, <em>limited</em>. But all this changed with color in California:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The black-and-white cover of the Beatles’ Revolver (1966) was followed by the color cover of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper (1967). Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeannie was black-and-white in the beginning of 1966, then turned into living-color Barbara Eden in the fall of 1966.<br><br> 
This change plays itself into the iconography and mythology of the 1960s… the middle of the late Sixties sees an explosion of glorious color. This change, a technological thing, in retrospect feels as if it had a philosophical or attitudinal component, as if the moment of that switch had something to do with some extra exhilaration in the air. It’s as if a change had taken place in the world itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">And how glorious. But the key here is the <em>technological</em> nature of the shift that renders the past obsolete. The world, colorized, is <em>now.</em> And California’s True North, like a Sunset Strip club promoter, has always been selling the idea that those colors are brightest <em>out</em> <em>here</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sixty years after it all began, “the Sixties” has become a mausoleum of beloved toys for the American cultural psyche and continues to be a supremely Californian cultural export. LaSalle considers three iconic music documentaries which recapitulate the birth, dissipation, and death of the era. It begins with D.A. Pennebaker’s 1967 cinema-verité work, <em>Monterey Pop</em>, about the Monterey International Pop Music Festival which took place at the beginning of the “Summer of Love.” Everything is vivid, harmonious. “The film instills a feeling … of some ideal distillation of values being possible.” Even though we know its lead firecrackers Janis and Jimi will soon be dead, any morbid implications are absolved because film here is being its magical, brazen varietal—a glue trap for images whose sole purpose is to keep the dead living, to bring them back on endless loops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the infamous Altamont Free Festival, likewise in California, is the natural bookend to Monterey, we are nevertheless temporarily rerouted 3000 miles east (and past a year of riots and assassinations) to Max Yeager’s farm, where Michael Wadleigh’s 1970 documentary, <em>Woodstock</em>, reveals the “dream” deferred (or plain sullied?):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Perhaps Woodstock, the idea goes, could be the model for a happy, peace-loving, beautiful society?<br>
<br>
But really? This is a model? Hundreds of thousands of intoxicated people, unable to wash, all but sitting in their own slop, cheering for a series of aristocrats that swoop down to entertain them and leave? Meanwhile […] the slave classes clean out the Port-O-Sans? That’s sustainable as a societal model?
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">He’s particularly hard-bent on wrapping knuckles on the tacky, tie-dye superficiality of the Woodstock generation. By stopping to really <em>look</em> at that peace-love-&amp;-shit fest, he attempts to assess the <em>quality</em> of the product the relentlessly self-mythologizing camerawork was selling. And rightfully, he’s none too impressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>[T]his indictment of unnuanced thinking is particularly apt outside the cult of Hollywood, in a country increasingly splintered into dueling versions of history that are both imbued with the zeal of religious fanaticism.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">“It’s as if everything that was spontaneous and irresistible two years earlier had solidified into a series of codified gestures that anyone could adopt,” LaSalle writes, which sounds eerily like the tech-corporate co-opted millennialism of San Francisco in the 21st century. In his blunt breakdown of the festival, it isn't terribly hard to find an awful lot of Michael Lang (the impresario behind Woodstock) &amp; Co’s&nbsp; “visionary” entrepreneurial spirit embedded in the idealistic tech-garble pumped out by the somewhat colder overlords of today. Their playbooks read similarly: highly flammable fodder for the imagination, the whimsical deployment of celebrity, a reliance on a naïve youth culture, and the exploitation of an underclass to keep things seamlessly afloat. Earlier in the chapter, LaSalle scores a palpable hit: “As the dream of every iconoclast who wants to find fellow iconoclasts who are iconoclastic in <em>exactly the same way</em>, California provides the ideal feeling of uniqueness and togetherness at the same time.” For my part I can’t help seeing signs pointing everywhere to Silicon Valley, where eager acolytes lap this kind of stuff up at TED Talks. LaSalle does eventually cut to Altamont, where it all <em>officially</em> ended—as captured in the Maysles Brothers’ unflinching <em>Gimme Shelter </em>(1970)—and where the Stones realize they’ll never get this down and dirty with our local <s>-</s>isms again (save for Jagger’s more true-to-self Studio 54 years). But what’s even more striking is that Charlie Manson’s merry band of bloodthirsty misfits had <em>already</em> made their mess a week prior to the Yeager dairy farm mud stomp. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“America,” LaSalle begins as the book ends, “is a judgmental nation. Not only do we create ideology where it isn’t, but we infer ideology into places where it simply is not present.” Maybe he’s remorseful for the earlier passage where he suggests that, ultimately, California lacks any culpability for its dissipations because it refuses to get “hung-up” by such concepts in the first place. No matter, this indictment of unnuanced thinking is particularly apt outside the cult of Hollywood, in a country increasingly splintered into dueling versions of history that are both imbued with the zeal of religious fanaticism. To think that technology has once more divided yesterday and tomorrow by bringing atomic (i.e. atomized <em>and</em> explosive) interpretations into multidimensional technicolor (now coming to a multiverse near you?) is an extrapolation so addictive it feels as though everything we’ve ever known was one of those crumbling, ash-heap worlds in Christopher Nolan’s <em>Inception </em>(2010), falling in on itself inside of Cobb’s mind like a stroke of Modernist poetry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which brings us to the Epilogue, in which LaSalle asks: Where does this all lead?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Probably nowhere bad. […] But however this plays out, this modern-day preoccupation with the self does seem in a line of succession from the California ideal as expressed through movies, and it should caution us as we extol, not without reason, the influence—indeed the triumph of the California ideal throughout the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Wait now, extol which ideal? The one that ignores the modus operandi that not only founded California, but also furnished it with the means to play the greatest hypocrisy of functioning hypocrisies in the wealth-besotted Western world? Look, I enjoy LaSalle’s wit and his expansiveness, the levity of his prose, and his deep appreciation for the artform. But the recovering New Yorker falls for the oldest trick in the Hollywood playbook. After 200 pages-worth of dissolution, dissatisfaction, spiritual malaise et al., he deploys that cornerstone of American culture: the happy ending.</p>

<p>This is the promise of the Every, the eponymous corporation at the center of Dave Eggers’ new novel. A sequel to <em>The Circle </em>(2013), <em><a href=""https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/the-every"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">The Every</a></em> picks up five years after the tech giant of the first book acquires an e-commerce juggernaut known only as “the jungle.” Combining the businesses of Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, and, yes, Amazon, Eggers frames the Every as Frankenstein’s tech monopoly, lumbering into the future as the literary townspeople watch in horror.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We follow Idaho-born Delaney Wells, one-time forest ranger and daughter of local grocers. Her Sisyphean goal: taking down the Every from the inside. With help from her friend Wes, a programmer, Delaney embarks on a mission to seed the company with ideas so ludicrous, so outrageous, that the general public will be forced to collectively cancel their one-stop-shop for everything online. Mae Holland, the impossibly naïve, Kool-Aid-drinking protagonist of <em>The Circle</em>, returns as CEO.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Safely isolated from the rest of the Bay Area on Treasure Island, the Every campus comes off like a deranged, corporate-sponsored B.F. Skinner experiment. Twitchy employees rely on notifications to guide their thoughts. Lucite podiums dot TED-talk-friendly auditoriums. Security stops all single-use packaging at the door. Lycra, for some reason, hugs every crotch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lacking a coherent plan, Delaney’s efforts as wannabe agent provocateur mimic the meandering plot. She and Wes nudge on the info-apocalypse one laughably toxic idea at a time, without really changing anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">But the novel shines in its doublespeak-laden descriptions of Every services, aided by the author’s command of California English and his <em>scorch</em>ing contempt for the tech world. Although the dialogue-heavy demonstrations occasionally slump into familiar op-ed musings, the sheer scope of app-derived unhappiness elicits morbid fascination, much like the viral videos of police brutality the Every servers host.</p>

Perhaps most disturbingly lifelike is <em>Samaritan</em>, a network for reporting objectionable behavior, resulting in an overall “Shame Aggregate.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">When Mark Zuckerberg implies that sharing is the only way to make the world a virtuous whole, the language he uses turns that performative submission into empowerment. But unlimited sharing also invites endless comparison. Endless comparison builds limitless opportunity costs into every choice, turning previously sheltered decisions into sources of potentially infinite regret.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who’ve come of age under Zuckerberg’s dominion understand this well. Simply living becomes a performance to an unseen audience. Incessant, crowdsourced moderation becomes self-censorship becomes empowerment, understood here as liberation from “bad” behavior.</p>

<p>In <em>The Circle</em>, Mae blithely notes that, with millions watching, “you perform your best self.” <em>The Every</em> follows this logic to its surreal conclusion: the abolition of privacy, on moral grounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it’s cliched to compare dystopian novels to <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, in the case of <em>The Every</em>, with its <em>ad absurdum</em> extrapolations, the comparison is apt. Indeed, the focus on surveillance capitalism Eggers began in <em>The Circle</em> almost demands it, reliant as the first novel is on pithy axioms reminiscent of the Ministry of Truth. But <em>The Every</em>’s subtext is a more insidious one. It concerns our collective acquiescence to dogma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In fact, <em>The Every</em>’s closest antecedent—more than the works of Orwell—may be <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>. Margaret Atwood’s 1985 exploration of America’s fascist shadow self addresses many of the same anxieties as <em>The Every</em>, but through the lens of the religious right, instead of militant vegans who find privacy tantamount to child abuse. In both, vocal, well-placed minorities impose their fanatical standards on the American public. Both emphasize the impossibility of escape when millions comply, afraid of being on the “wrong side.” And at their heart, both examine the evils inherent in moral crusades, while asking what causes—if any—are worth the trade-offs.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Eggers’ characters inevitably couch these questions within the language of human rights. And when these rights are framed as incompatible with privacy, as in the anti-abortion rhetoric that inspired Atwood, debate becomes impossible. The intrinsic virtue of “protecting” humanity precludes any genuine discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Every </em>traces how our actions online, far from being the atomized, rational choices of economists, further the narratives of the loudest and most outraged without substantive debate. Its insights stem not from the surveillance of Big Brother, but from<em> mob </em>surveillance, and the orthodoxies it imposes. Posturing on social media—signaling everything from identity to ideology—flourishes because participants know <em>everyone is watching</em>. Validation creates a feedback loop, drawing further engagement and conformist self-performance. That the same goes for <em>schadenfreude</em> hardly needs telling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eggers tucks these vexing topics in with amusing, meta-referential asides. But the book would be funnier if it didn’t feel so real. With a few changes and another tacked-on subtitle it could be sold as non-fiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the novel’s third act, the Every is well on its way to becoming the Only. The only retailer. The only news source. The only platform. Delaney pitches her endgame, conceived as the only way to save the world from itself: autocratic techno-communism, built from the e-commerce subscription model. Complete control over production and distribution, using personalized data, would assign an “all-encompassing Virtue Rating” to each consumer. Products and services would be allocated accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The use of the term “virtue,” which brings to mind the well-intentioned excesses of performative cancel culture, should not be understated. And the echoes of China’s Social Credit System are obvious. But seeing unrestrained, “consumer-centric” capitalism arrive at the same destination gives one pause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s hard not to see our own complicity. How many of us would gladly see discourse fenced into tidy Overton windows, social media scrubbed clean of references to critical race theory, or problematic transphobia? We vilify others’ behaviors. Crave validation from those we’ve never met. Desperately seek lives free from all we disagree with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sudden shift to Mae’s perspective presages the novel’s grim conclusion. The final pages culminate in a soliloquy fit for Orwell or Atwood:</p>

1443,"Chantal Akerman, Inside and Out","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I WATCHED THE GREAT</strong> Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman’s first feature, <a href=""https://www.criterionchannel.com/je-tu-il-elle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Je tu il elle</em></a><em> </em>(1974)<em>, </em>for the first time on the same day that the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the United States. Two months later, with much of the world in lockdown, the first of the film’s three distinct sections especially resonated with me. In it, the 24-year-old Akerman (vaguely differentiated from herself in the mononymous end credit “Julie”) is alone in her room arranging and removing heavy furniture, writing a letter, undressing, dressing again, and ingesting from a paper bag some scientific bare minimum of sustenance: sugar by the spoon. More or less simultaneously, Akerman’s matter-of-fact first person, past tense voiceover describes her character’s actions, which she says span about 28 days of isolation. Far from being slow or tedious, it’s an arresting exercise of dramatic imagination in a confined space and constricted state of mind, with the determination of her movements and compositions overriding any need for narrative context. There are countless other resonances (sexual, political, artistic) and unshakable sequences over the remaining hour too, when she hitches a ride with a young trucker and spends the night with a lover. These include the trucker, in a single take, telling his twisted, melancholic life story in the grainy black of his truck cab, and then, in a brightly lit apartment, the long, sculptural love scene between Akerman and Claire Wauthion that famously ends the film.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">With long haul travel and social visits of any kind off the table, there was something in those early, anxious homebound months of the pandemic that imitated the first solitary section of <em>Je tu il elle</em>. Your house, your apartment, your room, whatever, became all there was, and while gaining a new appreciation for having any roof at all over your head, it was against this setting that, like Akerman, you were suspended in a state of indeterminate pause, waiting and waiting. Joseph Beuys’ performance piece <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Like_America_and_America_Likes_Me"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>I Like America and America Likes Me</em></a>, executed fittingly in the same year Akerman shot her film, also came to mind, although its premise of spending three days in an empty room with a coyote, while thrilling, was almost the opposite of staying indoors during a pandemic, when the danger is outside and propagated by human free will. Akerman’s other early films were fitting company too, where she demonstrated the artistic canvas she could make of a living space and the way that space could make captives of her living subjects. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=incwmsMWbyM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Saute ma ville</em></a><em> </em>(1968), her very first film, she uses 10 minutes of confinement in a banlieu kitchen to build and blow up a scene of modern domesticity; in her most well-known, <a href=""https://www.criterion.com/films/302-jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles </em></a>(1975), she extends that idea over 200 masterful minutes which cover three days in the life of a single mother. In between those are the structural films she made while living in New York (like 1972’s interior explorations <em>La chambre </em>and <em>Hotel Monterey</em>) and <em>Je tu il elle</em>.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Then she turned 25. Over the next 40 years, the concerns of Akerman’s films expanded outwards from the foundations of her early films; in the very first place, <a href=""https://www.criterion.com/films/20978-news-from-home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>News from Home </em></a>(1977), the personal documentary that followed <em>Jeanne Dielman</em>, consists almost entirely of exterior shots of New York City and Akerman’s voiceover reading the letters she received there from her mother, a central source of inspiration in her life. Until her death in 2015, Akerman’s freedom as an image maker would allow commercial forays (1996’s <em>A Couch in New York</em>) alongside observational experiments in the aftermath of the USSR (1993’s <em>D’Est</em>) and, eventually, commissions from biennales and museums. Currently, the Marian Goodman Gallery in Paris is exhibiting two of Akerman’s rarely seen video installations that suggest yet a deeper significance in her work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first is <em>Je tu il elle, l’installation</em> (2007), in which excerpts from each of the 1975 film’s three parts (Akerman in her room, on the road, and with a lover) are shown side by side with the help of three projectors. The second installation, not exhibited in over a decade, is <em>From the Other Side</em> (2002), based on her documentary of the same name and year. A more radical restructuring of its companion film than <em>Je tu il elle, l’installation, </em>the piece spans three dark rooms and plays out on 20 screens. In the central room, you walk, like a Best Buy customer, among an array of 18 monitors arranged in rows on black, chest-high pedestals. The monitors play footage from the film, shot along the US-Mexico border, which captures with equal attention and effectiveness the borderland itself and the testimonies of the people living there—particularly those who’ve seen loved ones make or attempt the crossing north. Disturbing footage obtained from US border authorities after the film’s release also plays, showing migrants chased down in the middle of the night via cameras mounted on low-flying helicopters and ATVs.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">It has been well argued that by scattering her cinema across multiple screens and giving viewers the choice of where to look, what to hear, and when to come and go, Akerman’s gallery installations put you in the driver’s seat (the director’s chair, even), liberating you from the sense that, by passing hours in front of her quieter, observational films, you’re whiling away “<a href=""https://www.artforum.com/print/200404/in-her-own-time-an-interview-with-chantal-akerman-6572"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the time that leads toward death.</a>” Factually, the installations are liberating along those lines by the simple token of their gallery setting, though I found, conversely, that they imparted all the more intensely the substance and themes of their film versions. In literally walking among her moving images and, alternatively, observing from a distance the visual threads of her films unspooled and juxtaposed in parallel, the cold structure of <em>Je tu il elle</em> is clarified as Akerman’s frantic passage from introspection to observation and, finally, connection. In the <em>From the Other Side </em>installation, the sorrow felt by separated families, visible through their fidgeting and their fragile composure, is felt more acutely when flanked directly by scenes of unflinching border fence and gray desert sunrise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Altogether, the exhibition is as absorbing as seeing the original films on the big screen, and, with her work’s essential concern for overcoming alienation, it underlines the reward of encountering Akerman out in the world again.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>HANNAH FAGIN</strong>: How did you first become engaged in collaborative and community driven art practices?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SIYONA RAVI</strong>: I’ve always been interested in art and in social movements and community organizing, but I was introduced to them separately. The more I started learning, the more I could see how interconnected art and community organizing are. Historically, art has played such a huge role in raising consciousness and in movements for social change. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I feel so lucky I get to learn from people who do this work and now I get to do it for a living. A formative experiences was right out of college, when I worked with Anandam, a queer and trans branch of a sex workers union in Kolkata, India. As an undergraduate, I did research on the labor union,  Durbar, where I learned that over 60,000 sex workers collectivized to form a labor union, and how this organizing became a social movement in itself. Building on this research, I joined them after graduation to work on creative advocacy campaigns to repeal a law that, at the time, criminalized sodomy in India. Together, we came up with an idea to make a short film showing how this law has impacted members’ lives, interviewing lawyers, police, and other stakeholders. We also worked on a photography campaign with several other members of Anandam. The project was truly collaborative at every stage, which was often quite challenging, but really brought us all together. Members of Anandam art-directed themselves and decided how they wanted to be portrayed in the film and in photos. They invited us into their homes and spaces where they worked and then directed their own scenes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On an individual level, the project created the space for community members to express themselves and be presented the way they want to be–a real reclaiming of power. This project was also part of a national campaign to repeal the sodomy law, so we were really working to build solidarity in the service of this bigger goal. This was the first time I could really see how art’s role in creating change could very much come from the needs of the community.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What have you learned from your experiences working as an artist and facilitator with nonprofits like the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP), the Laundromat Project, and the collective initiative, Fundred Project?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not about coming in as outsiders with our own solutions to a community’s problem. It’s about getting to know the community and taking their lead. Especially coming from the non-profit side of things, organizations like the Laundromat Project and CUP have really created an infrastructure and a process for how art can be used to build community and solidarity. A lot of it is about showing up, and building trust. From a logistical standpoint, you have to budget time for this. Relationship building has to be a priority and that ultimately shapes the work.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a long history of artists and arts organizations coming in with a savior complex and causing harm to communities. There’s a lot of ways to address this, but at CUP, we explicitly follow a resource ally model to support communities in the work they’re already doing and follow their lead about what the solutions are. It’s not about the artist who comes in, it’s about the work itself and the people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">How do you build a shared vision in a collaborative project? How do you handle moments when different groups have competing interests or disagreements arise?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a hard question but it’s also the most important part of the process. Everyone needs to get what they want from a project on the table. From there you scope it down or up, depending on what your budget, timeline, and capacity is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disagreements are inherently part of this process. We need to lean into them and not worry that if a disagreement arises the project can’t move forward. If we have the tools and set up a space where people feel listened to and comfortable sharing, and the collective goals are agreed upon, then disagreements can be really fruitful moments. Working through tension is a form of relationship building and brings a critical lens to the project. Sometimes it’s about compromise, sometimes it’s about putting your ego aside; stepping back and understanding that it might not always go the way you expected is a big part of the process. You may have to let go of your personal vision for the sake of the shared one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What are the limitations of using art as a means of community building?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Art isn’t magically going to transform everything. It can help us reimagine the world we want to build, raise consciousness, bring people together. It can help people heal and connect with others. But you still need to keep that momentum of change going. You need to do the work of building that change and that new world. This could be at the policy, individual, or grassroots level. It’s always an ongoing process and art can be the starting point, the endpoint, or just the process.</p>

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What does authenticity look like in a community engaged practice? How can artists work authentically and non-exploitatively with their audiences?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of this is not coming into a project with your own solutions and realizing the project can go in different ways. There is a deep history of artists or organizations coming in with a savior complex and parachuting in with a project and then leaving. There’s so much work that has to happen before entering a community. The Laundromat Project has a thoughtful way of approaching this. They call it “Entering, Building, and Exiting.” It’s about thinking through your role and impact as an outsider. So, being really intentional about how you enter the community and build trust, how you sustain the relationships, and then thinking through what happens after you leave, once a project is over. Are you sure you aren’t abandoning the community you’ve worked with? That often happens—you get funded to do a project for a certain amount of time and when it’s over, that’s it. How do you transition out in a way that is sustainable and that leaves people in a place where they can still maintain the project if they want to? Part of this may be about sharing and transferring ownership of the materials and resources, making sure that people have access and can make the necessary decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the Fundred Project, Mel [Chin] goes back to all the cities he’s worked in. That’s why these relationships have been going on for so long. I remember talking to some folks he was working with in New Orleans and in Flint, Michigan, and they said, “When we met Mel, we thought he would be another artist who came in, did his project, and left. But he keeps coming back, so that’s why we’re still here.” The authenticity comes from the relationships we’re building and a commitment to the people, the issue, and the place. There’s so much love for everyone involved, and this goes far beyond the scope of the initial project.</p>

<p><strong>“LISBON IS THE CITY OF FERNANDO PESSOA,”</strong> an acquaintance told me before I left. This is one of two things that people seem to know about the city. The other is that there was an earthquake at some point. Fewer, even, know of Jose Saramago, the Nobel laureate. But as much as <a href=""https://www.ndbooks.com/author/fernando-pessoa/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Pessoa is an interesting figure</a>, I came to Lisbon in search of Paris. Not the Paris of tourists, but the Paris of the famed “Lost Generation” which roamed its streets in the Jazz Age. Portugal has become a magnet for artists in recent years. Ai Weiwei, the infamous contemporary artist, is one among the locust swarm of celebrities who have bought property in Portugal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On my walks across the city, I half expected Gertrude Stein and her entourage to pop out of an alleyway under the gentle sway of the white sheets that hung along the windows. I could almost see their shadows roam the basalt and limestone mosaic-covered sidewalks, a defining feature of Portugal and its former colonies, an art as old as civilization itself with origins in ancient Mesopotamia. But in search of the Lost Generation it was easy to get lost too, particularly among the throng of self-absorbed tourists.</p>

<p class=""indented"">I flew over in an impulsive move worthy of a Camusian novel. Tickets with the National carrier, TAP, are relatively cheap and, depending on the season, can even outdo low-cost carriers like Ryan Air.&nbsp; I checked into a windowless studio apartment within the walls of a Moorish fortress, likely built by Phoenicians and expanded successively as each new regime settled in to rule over the surrounding hills. The small, enclosed neighborhood, full of labyrinthine alleyways, was erected by the Berbers in the 10<sup>th</sup> century. It is reminiscent of an older version of Montmartre, a blend between a pre-war village and an ancient Roman <em>urbe</em>. As in Rome there are seven hills in Lisbon, but the city graced the river long before the fratricide in Italy. In fact, the city itself dates back to 1200 BCE, with evidence of human settlement in the area dating back over 30,000 years, making it the second oldest capital in Europe, next only to Athens.</p>

<p>As I passed hidden cathedrals from the 12<sup>th</sup> century with the sting of salted codfish in my nose, I could not help but feel as though my airplane had been a secret time machine. Whenever the bells chimed as I overlooked the city from one of its <em>miradouros—</em>viewing platforms scattered about the hills—this notion seemed to me confirmed. The Tagus at sunset is worthy of a thousand novels. As the sun flares over the Atlantic the river turns marmalade orange, and the small sailboats transform into the carriers of souls bound for a distant paradise. Faced with this view it is not difficult to understand why people still give credence to Ulysses being the origin of the name Lisbon—the Roman town went by “Olisipo.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">On the modern banks of the river stand monuments to Portugal’s great achievement: the first known circumnavigation of the globe, an achievement now forgotten to everyone but the Lusophones. At the heart of town marble steps descend into the waters. Here, pillars tell us the tale of the Kings and Queens of Portugal who, in early modern times, were the only heads of state to brave the high seas on visits to their colonial possessions dotted across the world. In the Napoleonic Era, they even moved their capital to Rio de Janeiro, making Portugal the only European state ruled from a former colony. These maritime feats are woven into the fiber of Portuguese identity. Pessoa and Luís de Camões both captured this in their respective verses, echoes of each other separated by three centuries. Between 1553 and 1570, Camões found himself roving the Indian Ocean. Pessoa, though he spent most of his life couch surfing through Lisbon, spent some of his formative years in the former English colony of Durban, in South Africa. In <em>Mensagem</em>, Pessoa acutely captures this longing for the sea that continues to haunt Portugal to this day: “The sea with an end can be Greek or Roman: the endless sea is Portuguese.”</p>

<p><strong>Beyond</strong> the marble steps that descend into the river sits a great plaza covered in white gravel and enveloped on three sides by monolithic Tuscan yellow structures. Following the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 1755 which destroyed 80% of the Imperial capital, the area was completely remodeled by an autocratic minister of the enlightenment, the first Marquis of Pombal. At the center of the world’s first earthquake-resistant neighborhood, today called the <em>Baixa Pombalina</em>, Pombal placed the imposing square, the <em>Praça do Comércio. </em>Though many new squares erected at the time served as both a safe space to take refuge in the event of an earthquake and a place for leisure and commerce, this 175m x 175m open space was undoubtedly a demonstration of power, a last testament to the wealth of the Portuguese Empire. I stood in the midst of this splendor accompanied by swarms of Germans, Spaniards, Frenchmen, and Americans, all drenched in the sweat of October heat. With smartphones in hand, they waited in line for a red trolley, one designed specifically for the selfie stick crowd. Pecking around the tables of the café Martinho da Arcada, opened in 1782 and one of Fernando Pessoa’s watering holes, people in Ray-Bans snapped photos of their food. I knew there were quainter sights to see. As I crossed a street that passes through the far side of the square, a man in a padded bomber jacket approached me with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“Hashish?” he whispered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though Portugal is famed for its substance decriminalization and the subsequent drop in crime rates, dealers and con men still loiter about the main tourist spots in search of victims. Ignoring the man’s presence, I turned left onto a curving uphill street. The red tourist trolley screeched past me. A small bridge over two buildings in an alleyway caught my attention. Though not hard to come across, they are a reminder of a pre-earthquake Lisbon. Upon inspection, graffiti worthy of Pompeii popped out in red lettering on a crumbled wall: “Digital nomads = Yuppies.” Though I did not immediately know the meaning of a yuppie, I knew that “digital nomads” was the label embraced by a horde of thirty-somethings who claimed to have unlocked the conjunction of the bitcoin bubble and remote work, and who now flooded into Portugal more for its sun and substances than for its history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In another alleyway on my way to a book launch, a man and a woman sat on a sidewalk each holding a hand-rolled cigarette. Above me a young brunette pulled in a dozen white sheets from a clothesline. It hit me that, here and now, this prevalence of white sheets meant a certain kind of death. The white hotel sheets had replaced the eclectic colors of Lisboetas’ clothes. The brunette wore a matching white uniform, and the smokers, blue denim aprons. The only open shops were sardine-packed with overpriced Chinese-made trinkets printed with Portuguese themes. Everywhere traditional shops had been closing, replaced by hotels, Airbnbs, and Chinese souvenir vendors. In 2019, before the pandemic, tourism accounted for almost 20% of the country’s GDP. The government has promised to combat the dislocation of Lisbon’s residents by tourists, but Covid-19 put a temporary stop to any concrete action. I looked at my watch to make sure that I was late. I doubted that the Fitzgeralds, Hemingway, or Picasso would have been punctual.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually</strong>, I made it to a book release at the Mombak Cultural Association, located in a property from the eighteenth century, featuring large modern glass panes overlooking the river. At the head of the room was a sunken rococo couch in need of restoration. Adjoining the cultural association lies one of Lisbon’s most expensive hotels in the shape of a converted 18<sup>th</sup> century townhouse. The gossip was that the hotel owner, in a desire to become a modern Medici, ceded the space to the association. To my dismay my watch had lied and I was as timely as a Swede, which in Lisbon meant that I was an hour early. When the speeches started the author’s voice broke, and tears ran down his cheeks. With a sun beaten face, he told us of the first time he set eyes on the Tagus twenty years prior. He had fallen in love with its golden color. I could not tell if he still loved it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Afterward, I found myself in a restaurant across the street where old pharmaceutical bottles were displayed in walls entirely covered by walnut cabinets. I sat with a journalist, a magazine editor, and a professor of finance. The bearded professor tried to keep up with the drinking. Accustomed to the robbery of northern Europe I trembled before the bill. But when I saw the tally, I felt that they must have made a mistake, for it seemed it was we who were the criminals. As in Picasso’s Montmartre, where artists flocked for the cheap housing and tax-free wine, the vinho here was cheaper than dirt, even with the tax. At the local supermarket I could pay €3 for a bottle of quality wine, sometimes less. Maybe this was the true attraction for those of a romantic disposition. The only difference was that rent was no longer reasonable. Tourists, digital nomads, and speculators have consistently driven up property prices in Lisbon, with yearly increases of almost 10% during the last decade. The average wage has not increased nearly as much. As a foreigner I paid without a second look and drunkenly left to find the author with the sun beaten face.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">There was only one traditional <em>tasca</em> left in the entire neighborhood, the only place where they still knew what a Portuguese <em>petisco</em> was, or who even spoke the language. The tavern’s walls were tiled with hand-painted stories of old empire, Moors, and Romans, refined like the rest of the city façades and the meticulously hand-placed pavement stones. When patterned with geometric shapes, these tiles tell of the Islamic legacy of the peninsula. When covered in blue on white motifs, they portray a lost Portugal, the country that once mastered the seas, whose quaint Catholic landscapes stretched across the globe. The tables were covered in paper towels. Pots and skillets banged. I could barely hear a thing. This place did not feign tradition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Holding court over an amalgamated row of tables was the author, yet again. A pot-bellied angry old man who barely pronounced a single vowel kept us fuelled with beer. Even in a land of wine, beer seemed an essential counterbalance. A couple, a journalist and photojournalist, sat next to me. They were younger than the rest. I could hear them, for they held a shouting match about some great acquaintance they had in common at <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>. “A true genius,” they repeated over one another. Here at last, I thought, was the diaspora I had sought: “the painters, poets, and plays” as sung by Emma Stone in Damien Chazelle’s <em>La La Land</em> (2016).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">At midnight the eclectic group scattered; editors and friends first, followed by the silver haired, until only I, the author, and the younger couple remained. When the <em>tasca</em> closed we headed to a bar. The beer was double the price and half as good. We stood in a street packed with people in polyester clothes. We discussed why it was that Azoreans sounded as though they spoke Occitan, and why it was that we Portuguese speakers understand Catalan better than Castilian. I have no good answer now, and I doubt anyone had one then, though I am sure someone thought they did. When discussing Lisbon, the photojournalist, a Carioca born and bred in Rio de Janeiro, remarked:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is not like it used to be.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had not known Lisbon twenty years ago, so I did not understand his point of reference. But his partner and the author both agreed. My plastic beer cup had disappeared when I returned from the toilet. Soon we outlasted the frenzied youths, and then the bar itself. The journalists went their way, and the author and I walked together in the opposite direction. Here and there we crossed abandoned surgical masks stuck on wet streaks of urine. What once had been the lively streets of poets echoed now with the wild shrieks of adolescence. Close to the bronze sculpture of Pessoa, just in sight of a statue of Camões, the author stopped, turned around, and burst out in Swedish:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They don’t care about poetry anymore; they don’t care about literature. Look at them!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In front of us stood a crowd of hysterical teenagers laughing as a girl fell off an electric scooter. Most of them filmed it with their phones. Few people had ever cared for poetry, I thought. I did not say this though. He had been to Lisbon before the monotone bedsheet standards had conquered its sky. Instead, I rallied with him against the decay of the poetic spirit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What will your generation write about? Nothing will be unique. Lisbon, Prague, Shanghai. It will all be the same,” he said.</p>

<p class=""indented"">We parted ways in the Pombaline Baixa, the earthquake-proof neighborhood which I had passed through earlier in the day. As I made my way up to my Phoenician-Roman-Berber-Lusitanian castle, under the tender light of the streetlamps, and past permanently closed cafés that once attracted the avowedly intellectual crowd, I could not get the image of those kids in plastic clothes out of my head. What was I to write about? As much as I would have liked to imagine otherwise, my bedsheets too were white. Was I just another digital nomad? Were we writers of the digital age bound to feast on the mortal remains of once poetic ports in search of authenticity? I wondered whether this city had been all that romantic twenty years ago, and if Paris a century past had been such a feast after all. I wondered whether in twenty years’ time I would cry on the banks of the Tagus for the lost Lisbon of my dreams. I wondered if I had come too late, or too early.</p>

1511,"The Things He Felt: Leonard Michaels","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AS THE STORY GOES</strong>, Samuel Beckett was strolling with a friend on a beautiful, warm spring day. “Ah, it makes one glad to be alive,” the friend smiled. Beckett paused, considering. “Well, I wouldn’t go that far,” he replied. Presumably they continued, the glorious sun still shining. Perhaps the friend smiled.&nbsp;A dark joke, after all, isn’t just funny; it’s an act of hope, even optimism, in the face of life’s tragedies and futilities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reading Leonard Michaels, the great story writer and essayist, brings Beckett to mind. “Windows were open. The breeze smelled of reasons to live,” says one Michaels narrator, evoking hope, weariness, acceptance. Often, Michaels seems tied to Beckett by a metaphysical thread. “Nothing is funnier than unhappiness,” says Nell in Beckett’s <em>Endgame</em>. For proof, look to Michaels’s dark comedies, which can sound like Beckett, if Beckett were raised speaking Yiddish on the Lower East Side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels’s great theme, echoing Beckett, is life’s myriad impossibilities, including happiness, married life, single life, self-knowledge, and enjoyable dinner parties. But he wasn’t just a miserabilist; in many ways, his career was <em>sui generis</em>. He produced a slim, lapidary body of work. Clean, sharp sentences, less written than chiseled, were Michaels’s trademark. Most of all, he gave feelings their due, as someone who seemed to feel more, see more, and experience more than everyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After his death, in 2003, he achieved a kind of anti-celebrity, famous for not being famous. “Why is Michaels not better known?” Mona Simpson asked. I’ve wondered, too, while pressing Michaels’s stories on friends and family. How could a short story master, admired by Susan Sontag, Philip Roth, and Cynthia Ozick, be so under-recognized? In gloomier moments, Michaels blamed himself: perhaps his perfectionism had something to do with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A</strong> writer’s writer, an obsessive’s obsessive, Michaels began publishing as Jewish fiction flourished in America. The years 1965–1975 saw Bellow’s best novels; Roth’s scream-of-consciousness, <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em>; Malamud’s <em>The Fixer</em>. Meanwhile, in small, obscure journals like <em>Atlantis</em> and <em>Eureka Review</em>, lucky readers discovered Michaels. He was hard to ignore once you spotted him.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">He had a knack for titles: “Murderers,” “Sticks and Stones,” “I Would Have Saved Them If I Could.” And a genius for opening lines. Each story begins with a bang: “The hall was clogged with bodies.” “It was a blind date.” “I scribbled a hasty note, regretful, to the point.” By all rights, these stories should fizzle out. Instead, they power on: “She met me at the door and smiled nicely. I could tell she was disappointed.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>You can’t imagine Michaels’s characters meeting at a dinner party. Maybe in an emergency room, late at night, awaiting triage.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Michaels was thirty-six, just like Roth, when his collection <em>Going Places</em> (1969) was published. If Roth claimed Newark, Michaels colonized Manhattan. His stories were like New York—intense, vibrant, and strange—and featured his alter-ego, Phillip Liebowitz. We meet Phillip at a curious juncture—the moment in adolescence when you think you might be something special but you’re still awash in self-doubt. “My name was Phillip, my style New York City,” he declares. ""I read books. I go to the flicks. I’m hip."" There’s a nervous, jumpy rhythm to the stories and a nervous, jumpy aspect to Phillip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In one adventure, he’s caught <em>in flagrante</em> by his girlfriend's furious father. There he was, “a hundred fifty-five pounds of stomping&nbsp;<em>schlemiel,</em>” huffing and raging. Hell hath no fury like a stomping schlemiel, except, perhaps, the schlemiel’s wife (“Morris, if something broke you'll rot for a month.”) The farce continues as Phillip flees naked into the night (“I’d walk on my hands,” he thinks. “Beards were fashionable.”) He’ll ride the subway to salvation, or so he thinks while streaking through Manhattan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leaving Phillip, we enter darker territory. To Don DeLillo, all plots move deathward; to Michaels, they move toward abjection and degradation. A young couple, “ravenous for intimacy,” tussles and battles; she loses teeth, he’s scratched blind (“but there was hope in corneal transplantation”). Things get darker still: there are contusions, concussions, shell-shock; rejection, deception, coercion. You can’t imagine Michaels’s characters meeting at a dinner party. Maybe in an emergency room, late at night, awaiting triage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was Michaels saying about people and violence? Over and over, we see the savagery beneath civilized surfaces; the primacy of the irrational; life’s basic absurdity and injustice. The stories mix humor and horror, but the strange, chilling quality comes from what’s missing: sympathy, sentiment, a moral center. If there’s a guiding spirit, it’s Isaac Babel, whose Red Cavalry stories influenced Michaels profoundly. Both writers practiced a kind of savage seeing into the heart of human darkness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With <em>Going Places</em>, Michaels achieved the recognition he deserved. When Susan Sontag named her favorite books of 1969, she chose <em>Going Places</em>, not <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em>, calling Michaels “the most impressive new American writer to appear in years.” She seemed to regard him as an honorary European, serious, exotic, deeply attuned to darker currents in human nature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michaels</strong> followed <em>Going Places</em> with a second collection, <em>I Would Have Saved Them If I Could</em> (1975). Readers expected strange, original stories, and they weren’t disappointed. Here was the comedy of misery (“She didn’t like me. So I phoned her every day”); intense feelings and inner conflicts; more dark comedy. In “Murderers,” a group of nice Jewish boys climbs a roof and watches a rabbi <em>shtupping</em> his pretty young wife: “We sat on that roof like angels, shot through with light, derealized in brilliance.” One boy, squealing with delight, slips, tumbling to his death. There’s no pleasure without punishment in Michaels; guilt is ambient, like the weather. After getting an eyeful, the boys are spotted, screamed at (“Murderers”), and banished to summer camp. At night, they're haunted by owls—“the sound of darkness, blooming.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naturally, readers wondered about that darkness. Was it pretension—a young writer’s mask of seriousness? In fact, Michaels came by it honestly. Born in 1933, the favorite son of Polish immigrants, his was a strange childhood, both blessed and blighted. Michaels’s father, Leon, was a calm, gentle, somewhat inscrutable man deeply attached to his native Poland. Trained as a rabbi, he saw a better future for himself in America, and, once settled, opened a barber shop, the better to take Shabbos off. Leon dressed well and projected good health, and in that way, Michaels took after him, dressing sharply, styling his hair as a teenager, keeping a slender, boyish figure for most of his life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With Leon’s hands full, his younger wife, Anna, raised three children (and proved the dominant parent to all). She was an anxious, efficient woman whose intelligence and determination were often overlooked. (Concealing her true age, she emigrated at 16 and taught herself English after arriving.) Anna doted on her children, especially small, fragile Lenny, while keeping a kosher home where no one went hungry. Nonetheless, life was hard; the family was poor. They scraped by on Leon’s modest earnings and Anna’s contributions from sewing. It all went toward rent and meals, each meager dollar carefully allotted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of Michaels’s inheritance was a deep, abiding guilt. “My mother had done too much for me…It’s hard to forgive self-sacrifice,” he once wrote. As for Leon, Michaels felt equally indebted. (“He gave,” Michaels remembered. “I took.”) Michaels never forgot how, as a mischievous child, he once tripped his brother, who fell, smashing their father’s cherished violin. “I wish my father had become enraged, knocked off my head, so I could forget the incident."" Indeed, the boy who craved punishment would often veer towards punishment and violence in his fiction. Young Lenny experienced “early notions of guilt as fundamental to life.”</p>

<p>Guilt had many tributaries. When Michaels was 6, Germany invaded Poland; into the home flooded stories of horror and murder. Once again, it’s easy to connect the violence against Michaels’s family and the violence in Michaels’s stories. “The Holocaust is <em>never </em>absent from his writing,” says Michaels’s widow, Katharine Ogden Michaels. “It was always the engine of his imagination.” In the end, nearly all of Anna’s relatives perished. Watching Anna grieve, Michaels absorbed the lesson that life is anarchic and savage. Like any acutely sensitive child, Michaels experienced her feelings as his own. “Her many fears nourished mine,” he wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given all this, the wonder is that Michaels thrived as a teenager, making friends, acquiring a certain swagger. He was a watcher, alert and curious, who spent countless afternoons drawing (good training, it turned out; Michaels’s essays show a painter’s eye for detail). His parents indulged his artistic leanings—to a point. “He was supposed to make something of himself and support my parents,” his sister Carol Foresta recalls. It was obvious to everyone but Michaels that he would attend City College, the “Jewish Harvard.” Instead he chose NYU, abandoning medicine for literature. A providential encounter with Austin Warren, co-author of <em>Theory of Literature</em>, sealed his fate.</p>

<p><strong>After</strong> NYU came graduate school in Michigan, which may as well have been Athens to a sheltered Manhattan boy. There, he made two quick discoveries: alcohol, a goyish phenomenon, and casual conversation (“Where I came from everything was personal”). There were anti-Semites at U of M—not just students but professors. A happier discovery was the New Criticism, a method of textual analysis that could unravel a book’s deepest mysteries. Through serious, immersive reading, he forged a philosophy: art as religion; literature as vocation; reading as a way of life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Michigan was eye-opening, then UC Berkeley, his next stop, was an even greater revelation. The furthest point, geographically and spiritually, from New York, he would eventually settle there, first for more graduate work. Here he found a deeper immersion in literature, falling for Byron’s “extremely bleak vision of experience.” Returning to Michigan, he finished courses and nervously submitted his dissertation. He needn’t have worried. Michaels was a triple thinker with a clear, graceful style. “It is an absolutely brilliant performance,” a future Berkeley colleague gushed, “written as no Ph.D. dissertation that I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One assumes these were happy times—happier, at any rate, than his brief, stormy marriage to Sylvia Bloch. In Manhattan, he’d met Bloch—slender, dark-skinned, exotic, 19—and was instantly smitten: “The question of what to do with my life was resolved for the next four years.” It was the type of <em>coup de foudre </em>Michaels was always vulnerable to. In a sane moment, he pondered backing out, but both Leon and Anna favored the union. “She was Jewish,” Carol recalls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What followed—several years of madness and misery—is recounted in <em>Sylvia</em>, Michaels’s harrowing memoir. Raised in a calm, stable household, he had no idea how much chaos two people can create, nor how a peaceable person can get inured to screaming and violence. <em>Sylvia </em>recalls a nightmare of horrible, hopeless enmeshment. “If Sylvia said I was bad, she was right,” Michaels would think. So it went: Michaels felt guilty; Sylvia confirmed it. He wanted punishment; she supplied it. Indeed, <em>Sylvia </em>shows<em> </em>how perversely they suited each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it wasn’t divorce that liberated Michaels, it was Sylvia’s suicide, an event that seemed both shocking and foreordained. One can barely imagine Michaels’s anguish. Yet what was wrenching for the man was useful for the writer. From then on, he would explore romantic misery—“the way men and women seem unable to live with or without each other.” That meant probing romantic darkness: how shared traumas bind people; how love and hate commingle; how strong, buried impulses, even murderous ones, find erotic outlets. Such realities formed “the sadomasochistic dynamic at the erotic core,” Michaels wrote, echoing Freud. Indeed, Michaels couldn’t stop exploring troubled relationships. “The subject is inexhaustible,” he told <em>Esquire </em>editor Gordon Lish.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>By</strong> dwelling on pain, trauma, and their sequelae, Michaels earned a reputation. “I’d never write about being happy,” he vowed. “It's of no interest as a dramatic subject.” Thus it often surprised people that the brooding, serious-minded author of <em>Going Places</em> was actually warm, funny, and garrulous. The poet August Kleinzahler recalled “this brilliantly engaging meshuggener” spouting smart bluster, strong opinions. “Lenny was like a <em>tummler</em>,” his friend David Reid recalls. Practically everyone found Michaels lovable. “There was always a generous side to Lenny. Very generous,” says the essayist Phillip Lopate. “He would do anything for a friend, basically.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Physically, Michaels was handsome, even dashing, and comfortable in his body. (In photos one sees why: He had a lithe figure, a thick, unruly head of hair, and a wonderfully expressive face, with deep, recessed eyes.) Politically, he was hard to pin down: anti-corporate, pro-worker, and passionately pro-Israel. “He seriously ran afoul of Berkeley liberals on that subject,” Katharine Michaels recalls. As a young professor, he sided strongly with Israel in its wars and always despised anti-Semitism. It was there in anti-Zionism, a new strain of an old disease. “You see it in people who become hysterical when their ancient right to hate Jews is brought into question,” he wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels’s outrage over anti-Semitism informs <em>I Would Have Saved Them If I Could</em>. Here, in its grim particulars, is the story of Michaels’s grandfather, wounded by Polish pogromists. A small, slender man, essentially helpless, he lay bleeding and semi-conscious before staggering home. History, wrote Michaels, “flings you into a cellar and saves you for bullets.” Recalling this nightmare, Michaels was making a point: This wasn’t “historical dialectic,” he wrote sharply, objecting to abstract theorizing. “I’m talking about my grandfather, my grandmother, and my aunt.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels’s motley collection—less violent, more personal than <em>Going Places</em>—confirmed him as an original, not just Babel’s disciple. Old admirers cheered (“A dense, ribald, astringent outpouring of pure talent”—Sontag). <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> celebrated “an important literary event.” Yet when major prizes were announced, Michaels was overlooked. “A collection of 40‐year‐old short stories by Vladimir Nabokov and not a collection of brand‐new short stories by Leonard Michaels?” the critic John Leonard complained in <em>The New York Times</em>. “Who does the nominating, anyway?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Michaels</strong> was rightly annoyed by such slights, which, though normal in publishing, left him feeling mistreated and excluded. “I’m afraid I’ll never look kosher enough in the eyes of the establishment,” he sighed while waiting for a Guggenheim. All his life, Michaels’s hyper-alertness worked against him as he noted fresh insults, new injustices. Friends failed him. Critics assailed him. Bad writers outsold him. “I think you might be horribly amused,” he told his editor in a frustrated moment; “you might better understand my fits of resentment against the world.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romance remained another fraught subject for Michaels. In all, he would marry four times, once per decade after the 1950s. His feelings about marriage—the dark comedy of cohabitation; men’s role in the trouble—would inform his long-awaited novel. What sounds like a borscht belt gag—a lawyer, two therapists, and a tax accountant walk into a Berkeley living room—was the serious conceit behind <em>The Men’s Club</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first rule of the Men’s Club is total honesty. “Can I tell a story?” someone pipes up. “Only if it’s miserable,” comes the reply. Over a long evening they’ll kvetch, confide, and commiserate, sharing shames and troubles. At times, the problem of marriage seems to stand in for the larger, Beckettian problem of living. “Life is unfair business. Whoever said otherwise?” one man says. “It is a billion bad shows, low blows, and number one has more fun.” That sense of comic futility colors their conversations, and extends in all directions. “All this talk, talk, talk,” one man sighs exhaustedly. “It’s sick.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The book proved popular and controversial. Was it unforgivably sexist? Or slyly feminist? Or perhaps a work of accidental feminism, exposing men’s weaknesses? Somehow, the book’s true subject—male fragility and confusion—was largely overlooked. These men are a sorry lot, numb, dumb, and befuddled, stuck halfway up the evolutionary ladder. “The reader laughs and gags,” wrote John Leonard in <em>The New York Times</em>, comparing Michaels to Kafka and Chekhov.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many readers were less charmed. What goes on in men’s minds isn’t always pretty, and writing honestly about men’s thoughts and desires made Michaels vulnerable to charges of sexism. “The only characters…who have strength and brains are women,” Michaels protested. “The men are blind to themselves.” It was futile. That Michaels admired women; mentored female writers; and quietly offered blurbs, advice, and encouragement to women he’d never met, nor had any hope of meeting, was hardly ever reported, and Michaels never flaunted his generosity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all its departures, <em>The Men’s Club </em>featured classic Michaels themes. Marital misery. Life’s basic unfairness. Intractable shame. (“Don’t be ashamed,” says one clubber; “We didn’t come here tonight to be ashamed.”) The questions that plague midlife—who am I, really? how did I mess things up so badly?—are central, signaling a greater crisis of identity. Happy illusions, sustaining myths: when these dissolve, you’re in major trouble. Then again, trouble—moral, psychic, romantic—was always Michaels’s metier.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In</strong> some sense, Michaels’s main quarrel was with life itself. “Nobody gets through life without causing pain,” one character sighs, echoing his creator. The problem is large and inexorable. “You couldn’t simply live in a society,” Michaels once wrote. “Simply to breathe incurred responsibilities.” Behind these existential burdens were myriad smaller ones. “Look, I’ll be completely honest. I can’t stand couples,” says a Men’s Clubber. “I hope none of your wives ever invites me to dinner.” Who can blame him? The boredom; the tension; the simmering hostility. Every friendly party begins to look like <em>Guernica</em> when you look closely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels wasn’t one for pretense. “Living in the world requires a certain social veneer,” Katharine Michaels points out. “Lenny never made his peace with that.” In Berkeley the veneer was thick, especially at dinner parties. After a couple of drinks, Michaels would get provocative, “throwing a wrench into the politeness of the evening.” Michaels would relish his mischief, having laid waste to another genteel Berkeley gathering, then find himself guilt-ridden. Yet the same impulse struck at faculty meetings, from which he was eventually excused (“they found him too disruptive,” Katharine recalls).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following <em>The Men’s Club</em>, Michaels seemed adrift.<strong> </strong>In 1990 he published <em>Shuffle</em>, a potpourri of fiction, memoir, and journal; it was either wonderfully or annoyingly eclectic, depending on your taste. Harsh reviews were nothing new (“The Howe review came like a blow from God,” he wrote in 1975), yet each seemed to reopen old wounds. As friends observed, there was something innocent—open, unprotected—about Michaels. “There were good consequences to that,” says Katharine. “But he was sort of un-defended.” A different writer, with more protective armor, might have suffered less. Not Michaels, “whose nerve endings were right on the surface.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Critics aside, Michaels’s writing was sharp and finely observed. In 1993 he published <em>To Feel These Things</em>, a title that doubled as a credo.  Never mind major events; the real drama of our lives is internal, our doubts, dreads, and pleasures. The primacy of feelings is the not-so-hidden theme of Michaels’s published journals as well. The Michaels sensorium leans heavily towards worry and unease, but also surprise and amazement. The feelings are warm, but Michaels is cool, precise—an empiricist of emotions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were revelations as well. What the fiction conceals, the essays and journals reveal: an earnest humanism; a lofty regard for the individual. One should ignore<strong> </strong>modern culture, he wrote, and reclaim “depths of soul,” “the quiddity of people.” Michaels relished this highly unfashionable language: <em>souls</em> and <em>quiddities</em>. “He was a radical conservative,” Katharine laughs, noting how, among progressives, Michaels remained a maverick freethinker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels’s Beckettian streak, the sense that life is 1,000 small futilities adding up to one large futility, still ran deep. “It was a nice day,” he wrote in <em>Sylvia</em>. “I felt only a little miserable.” As time passed, he increasingly valued simplicity, yearning to “escape sophistication and see innocently.” Such was Michaels’s credo in the 1990s: Don’t think—feel. Thinking vitiates experience. Indeed, a simple, ingenuous quality entered Michaels’s writing, as did a new tenderness. “I loved her so much it hurt my teeth,” says a Michaels narrator. In another story, an American studies Japanese alongside his Asian wife. “We sit together at the kitchen table, and she helps me perfect the sounds…” The moment lasts; the set-piece ends; the reader is left with simple, loving silence. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Skeptical</strong> of happy endings, Michaels might not have predicted one for himself, but in 1996 he married Katharine Ogden after a speedy courtship. Life together was a happy blur of museums, book talk, and furtive cigarettes. (“I haven’t been smoking!” he would plead after Katharine started sniffing the air.) The previous years had been difficult ones. “I can't somehow project a benevolent authorial persona,"" Michaels said in 1993. In his journal, he pondered why: “My writing feels warm until I revise, make it better, and then it gets cold. I should mess up my sentences, make them warm, make money.” Warm, relatable books won prizes. Cool books didn’t. By then it had been eleven long years since <em>The Men’s Club</em>. “He was starting to feel like a failed writer,” says Katharine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was about to change. Raphael Nachman, his sublime creation, was born on a snowy winter day in 1997. Michaels sat down to write and for the first time had the peculiar sense of taking dictation; of being less a story’s author than its vessel. Michaels’s normal method—slow, careful accretion—had ensured a modest output. (“I’d go mad with concern over semicolons. Conjunctions ruined my sleep.”) But his celebrated Nachman stories, seven in all, began effortlessly. “That first story was definitely waiting for him,” says Katharine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nachman is middle-aged, quiet, with a sprawling inner life. He enjoys his own company and gets his thrills solving complex mathematical equations. Moral questions bedevil him: should he inform a friend of his wife’s affair? Should he ghostwrite a term paper on philosopher Henri Bergson? Even gentle Nachman harbors aggressive impulses. He meets new women; his libido stirs. Like many Michaels men, he’s surprised by his lust and aggression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>These are works of quietness, subtlety, and grace, without the eruptiveness of the earlier stories.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The stories ponder a problem at the center of life: how do we handle our selfish, aggressive urges? If we suppress them, we betray our true nature; if we express them, we forfeit our dignity and risk harming others. It was a deeply vexing question to Michaels, whose work had always explored our uncivilized nature. We become brutish—in a sense, Nazi-like—very easily, as Nachman discovers. Here was the oldest philosophical question, reframed: When our moral ambitions collide with our baser instincts, how should we act? In short, how good can we be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Nachman stories—gentle, mellow, deceptively conventional—offer few answers, but like Kafka’s stories, simply pose questions. These are works of quietness, subtlety, and grace, without the eruptiveness of the earlier stories, and they found a large audience through <em>The New Yorker</em>. They seem to reflect Michaels’s late style, a mix of tenderness and retrospection. “I approached the wavering light of Friday night candles in our kitchen window,” Michaels recalled in one essay. “The shadow of my mother, against the window shade, moved from refrigerator to stove. Everything as it should be."" Everything home represented—safety, comfort, warmth—is neatly captured in that phrase, <em>Everything as it should be</em>, its stable rhythms—<em>everything</em>, a solid dactyl, melting into soft, soothing trochees: <em>as it should be</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his final essay, “My Yiddish,” Michaels again returned to childhood. “This moment, writing in English, I wonder about the Yiddish undercurrent,” he wrote, noting his opening clause—“a thought that hangs like a herring.” Perhaps there was a watermark, faint but visible, in everything he wrote: Yiddish sounds, Yiddish warmth, a Yiddish shrug after sentences. “To some extent, my intuitions and my expressions of thoughts remain basically Yiddish.” It was baked into his sentences. “There is a kind of enforced intimacy with the reader. A Jewish kind, I suppose.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Enforced intimacy”—the words flush, conjoined, intimate—describes Michaels’s finest writing. Within the Michaels cult is a smaller sub-cult that adores his nonfiction. The forms play to Michaels’s strengths: his roving intellect is well suited to essays; his impatience, his need to get to the heart of things, is served by short, fragmentary journal entries. The essays feature a deep intelligence, a cool, beguiling voice, and beautiful sentences. The diaries buttonhole you—<em>Listen!</em>—with urgent memos from his emotional world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels died in 2003, having traveled the greatest distance as a writer, yet his themes were remarkably consistent. In the early stories, Phillip flirts with cruelty, indulging his not-so-nice side. Who am I, he seems to be wondering: mensch or monster? Friend or seducer? Voyeur or participant? Am I a simple creature? Or am I fighting my own character? Decades later, in his final incarnation, Nachman is still discovering—and reckoning with—his unseemly side. Like many Michaels characters, he’s abandoning shame, coming closer to self-acceptance. The work of a lifetime was nearly complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Writers die twice,” Michaels once wrote, “first their bodies, then their works.” Maybe so, but Michaels has enjoyed quite an afterlife. Memoirs by friends keep his name circulating; well-curated collections of his stories and essays keep attracting readers. Meanwhile, Michaels’s widow is organizing his archives and writing a memoir of their marriage. The critic Sven Birkerts defines a cult writer as one “that many readers like to hug to themselves as a kind of secret.” Michaels is the opposite: a secret everyone wants to share.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that spirit, I suggest starting with the Nachman stories, sampling the journals, then going back to <em>Going Places</em> and <em>I Would Have Saved Them If I Could</em>. But, really, any place works for this versatile and virtuosic writer, whose mission was “to feel these things,” and share those feelings with readers.</p>

<p><strong>THE FRIENDS WHO CAME TO HELP</strong> me set up for my one-night show at the museum couldn’t keep themselves from laughing. An hour before the opening, they found me sitting on my living room floor drinking wine and watching a romcom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I admit it was an odd image. I had put so much effort into the show: six months of studio time, crammed in before and after work, and consuming every weekend. I’d spent Thanksgiving that year at my studio, firing porcelain clay in a gas kiln to 2000<sup>o </sup>F; I’d hauled a couple of pieces I’d made in France over 5000 miles back to my home in California. And there I was, looking like an unmade bed, with wrinkled clothes and tangled hair, barely registering the ceramics all around me, which sat unpolished and unpriced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In practice, I find waiting until the last minute to set up a show really helps with the nerves. With so much work to do and so little time, there just isn’t a lot left of <em>you</em> to give to the ordeal. And what I’m looking to avoid the most is valuing and pricing my work. I guess that’s why I ask for second opinions from anyone willing to give them. At the museum café where I often sold my art, there were a couple of regulars whom I knew and trusted; I’d bombard them with pricing questions about my newest pieces whenever they happened to be around. For this evening’s show, I’d reached out to a friend of a friend, a good soul whom I knew to be well-connected in the California art world. But it took the urgency of impending showtime to put her advice to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With fifty or so ceramic pieces, each the weight of a medium sized dog, polished and waiting to be carried into my Kia and on to the museum, my friends and I got to work. One broken piece later, we found ourselves miraculously setting up the show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What are you going to price this for?” asked a friend, holding up one of the larger pieces.&nbsp; “I don’t know, you pick,” I replied. She rolled her eyes. To me, the piece suddenly looked grotesque. How could I sell <em>that</em>?</p>

<p>Minutes before the starting time, with attendees already in the lobby, I finally rattled off three options for each piece: a “low,” a “medium,” and a “high” one. I’d let anyone who wanted to buy my work choose the price for themselves.</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> process of pricing art appears simple enough. Like commodities in general, art requires certain materials and skills, all of which go into a calculus resulting in a number meant to signal value, which may or may not satisfy the artist. As with other commodities, the novelty of the artwork or its creator might play a role in its valuation, while the same can be said of familiarity and fame. Social and material trappings, also supposedly fine-tunable, often follow. Of course, this calculus is disingenuous. Art escapes concreteness, it eludes definition and so its essence and worth are intractably subjective, its value uncompromisingly opaque.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet “How to” guides for monetizing art abound online. The cheery author of “5 Tricks for Monetizing Your Art,” for example, advises the oversensitive artist to professionalize an exercise which is admittedly “cumbersome” and “soul-draining,” the idea being, “Well, if it's soul-draining, take the soul out of it.”&nbsp; Four more “tricks” follow, of which the last and most important is building an online “fan base,” which sounds like the most soul-draining aspect of all—at least for this artist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other creators distance themselves from the cash-nexus by hiring a “middle person.” If the artist doesn’t have to be personally involved and can avoid facing a buyer’s eyes, they can avoid all the messiness that comes with two people being in direct contact. And, of course, for the artists who can get a foot in the door, there are always art galleries. But so-called “mid-size” galleries, let alone storefront venues, have been disappearing in the US, even in artistic metropoles like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. “A sign of the times,” said Mark Moore, a long-time art dealer, in 2016 . As for “investment-grade art,” which involves playing the long-term game in secondary markets, the numbers involved are so far outside the realm of my material sensibilities that “speculative” is the only word in that world I think I understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond that, of course, there is always Instagram. Though I try my best to avoid it. I find the copious content supposedly tailored to “my” aesthetic stunts me. I have so little trust in my capacity not to reproduce others' work, or not to chase social media “likes” and lose my sense of self in the process. People rationalize “borrowing” others’ work as simply part of what it means to be an artist. We borrow, sure. (But not <em>all</em> of it…) There is something unnerving about limitless artistic content and by extension endless possibilities for reproducing, leaving little room for valuing the “creative.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>That</strong> people with familial obligations (often immigrants) tend to avoid pursuing art altogether, opting instead to pursue practical work like STEM or law, sounds like an old cliché: a type of moral obligation forged by the sacrifices their parents made to provide for their futures. This idea may seem trite in its oversimplification of diverse peoples and experiences, yet it remains powerful in its allusion to alternate livelihoods, to entire lives that could have been.</p>

<p>In college, I chose to major in physics on a whim; interior design was my first choice. One afternoon I told my brother. “You want to design rich suburban wives’ homes?” he asked. We lived in a modest townhouse in an Illinois suburb, having moved from Venezuela a decade prior. At sixteen, what little idea I had of American art “work” included very few professions. And my brother was right: I didn’t want to do <em>that</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not that we didn’t have “creatives” in our lives. There were aunts, uncles, and cousins who were painters, filmmakers, and musicians. Uncle Goro and Aunt Lou sustained themselves completely through their art (he as a painter, she as a ceramicist and a filmmaker). But there was also my father, who had continued living in Venezuela and had long since chosen to continue painting in the remote mountain town he seldom left. After a while, “Dad” became synonymous with the Artist, a caricature made possible by a type of limited bond formed across distant geographies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It sounds like you’re talking in German,” he would say of my Spanish, after we had lived apart for a decade. I’d grown accustomed to expressing myself in English with everyone but my mother. Stumbling in the only language he knows only hardened my forgetting. I was embarrassed. Ultimately our collective frustrations and misunderstandings created a chasm too deep to overcome with long-distance phone calls. So, my father remained the Artist devoted to Art.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, I had become disillusioned with my own creative practice; by the time I was twenty-six, I would begin a PhD in an energy-related field and almost entirely forget a time when my genes connected me to art.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When</strong> I started making art again, I wasn’t searching for it. It was the summer of 2014, a period in my life marked by a mix of intellectual monotony and existential dread (what a PhD can do to a soul). I was ripe for impulses. On a warm August afternoon, I booked a flight to France, and left the next day. It had been ten years since I’d visited my Aunt Lou and Uncle Goro at their house in the Loire Region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Their home, an old farmhouse, had been built in the early 1900s, and Lou and Goro have been making it their own over the last two decades. They’ve kept everything they could from the family that originally built the place: from the house’s stone walls, blue wooden shutters, kitchen tiles and cement floors, to old farming equipment like saddles and pitchforks. But in the first floor bedroom, which faces a sweeping communal moor, they cut a window about three meters wide and two meters tall into one of the stone walls. The fog on the moor envelops you in the early mornings; during the day, distant cows and horses traverse in and out of view. Across the rest of the house, the items of the past still have a place, arranged anew to carry out Lou’s and Goro’s artistic vision. Their eye for aesthetics is so all-encompassing that to step into that home is to believe everything has beauty. One simply needs to attend to it, (re)imagine it, allow it in, to thrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are tiny, old radios in nearly every room. Even in the back of the house, where Goro has his studio—beyond the farming equipment, worn-out wooden frames, and unattended grape vines—you can hear the radios playing France Musique, the local radio station devoted to jazz and classical music. Baroque music does wonders for rusty plows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create their living room, my aunt and uncle tore down a wall that had previously divided a boy’s and a girl’s bedrooms. The comically gendered palettes of the previous rooms—light blue for boy and pinkish red for girl—express new life, accented by a large, red leather couch on the blue side, and by Lou’s ceramics and Goro’s paintings scattered throughout the room. Her geometric vases and imposing bowls catch your eye immediately, popping against the colorful walls; his distressed paintings of whimsical animals and portraits reflect the house’s history, like artwork that had been there all along.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After I had time to settle in, Lou showed me her studio. It’s a small, stone-walled room that no one under five-foot-six could comfortably stand in, packed with a potter’s wheel, glazes and chemicals, and an assortment of tools. In the tight quarters, I watched her explore the delicateness and strength of porcelain clay; confident yet reverent, Lou pulled the clay to its limit, until light shined through it, and then scored its surface as it dried. When it was my turn, she hovered over me, teaching me how to keep the clay in the center of the wheel to channel its centripetal force. <em>“Tienes que quedarte ríjida.”</em> You have to stay firm. She hardly finished her sentence before I pushed her away.<em> “Lo sé tía, déjame, por favor.”</em> I know aunt, leave me please. She left. When she and Goro came home at midnight six hours later, I was still there at the wheel, in the cave-like, dusty room, with a warm, dim light hanging over me. Seeing me, Lou smiled.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>My</strong> foray into the art-selling world started about five years into my PhD program. By then I knew how to turn out bowls and cups and other vessels easily, understanding them as the kind of items whose very functionality relegated them to the status of any other commodity or artisanal work. But over time, my pottery had begun to show aesthetic cohesion. We—my work and myself—had become identifiable, I was told, and I started a website to document and picture all my pieces in one accessible, catalogable form.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One day, I showed my website to the couple who owned the café in the local art museum, after they’d asked how I’d been spending my “free” time. I felt an odd and uncomfortable pride when they wanted to buy platters from me. “How much are you selling them for?” they asked. Blushing, I said, “Nothing, I don’t want money for them.” Why would I? I wasn’t trying to make a profit. Until that point, I usually just brought my ceramics to my PhD department’s kitchen and placed them next to a piece of paper with the word “FREE” scribbled in big, childish letters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the owners insisted, and we agreed that instead of selling them my work, I would display, and maybe sell, my artwork in their café. That I found my stomach churning at the thought of pricing my art made me wonder why I had ever agreed to the arrangement. The obvious answer would be to make ends meet. My medium costs money. By my standard, lots of it. The more I experiment or produce, the more the bills pile up: monthly studio fees, cost of materials, electricity, gas. And then where do you store it all? It’s enough to need a high-paying tech job, just to be able to quit it, and take up ceramics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another, more complicated answer comes from the economic abstraction that determines value. That is, to make “good” art means to make art that can sell, that has an exchange-value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How’s your work going?” someone asked me recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Good” … “I’ve sold out of most of my pieces” … “I sold that one for $400.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m embarrassed that I’ve blurted such cringy things to people. A charitable explanation is that in an attempt to demonstrate how my pieces have been accepted and valued by others, I find myself talking about how much people are willing to pay for them. (It’s good; I can sell, okay?) These discussions are like a pernicious, slippery game of social relativity, whose players are stalking the other-world of art and value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This game is why I think people are always asking ceramicists a version of the question, “How long does it take you to make this?” I don’t believe they really want to find out; rather, they’re trying to discover an easy translation between the time you spent on the work and the value placed on it. But I scroll through the steps, trying my best to tally up the process. “Well, there’s the creative part, which I can’t explain, and the preparation of the materials, wedging, mixing chemicals….” It’s unclear when they lose interest, but eventually they all do. And I have to confess, I don’t care, either. What business is it of theirs, anyway?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never have these conversations with strangers who are interested in buying my art, partly because I’m not around often. When I began selling my work at the café, I avoided stopping by, afraid I’d catch someone staring at a piece, then at the price, then walking away. Anonymity shielded me from potential disappointment. But after a while, when I realized the pieces were consistently selling, I allowed myself back inside, ready to experience a different form of anonymity: for the unknown buyer, I was simply the Artist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re the artist?” a woman asked me one day. (<em>Me? The person in a puffer jacket, sweats, and gym shoes just sipping a coffee, working on my dissertation?</em>) “I just bought this,” she said, holding a small bowl of mine. “Your work reminds me of the paintings I’m exhibiting in the museum right now.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I blushed and thanked her. She was an artist too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A</strong> few months before my show, I noticed a WhatsApp message from my dad, the Artist far away in Venezuela. Before I looked at it, I imagined it must have said the usual: <em>“Hija me haces falta. Tqm.”</em> Daughter, I miss you. I love you. My normal reply would be similarly terse: <em>“Yo también papá, me haces falta. Tqm.”</em> Over the years, we’ve confined ourselves to these few words to express the challenging and inexpressible. We are so distant, after decades spent apart.&nbsp; I reluctantly looked down at my phone. Surprised, I read: <em>“Me encanta tu arte.” </em>I love your art. He went on to tell me he saw me as an artist—like himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt a sensation I had experienced the first time I saw him after a decade apart. In the six-hour car ride to see him, I was crippled by stomachaches. (Motion sickness caused by the mountainous roads, I’d thought.) But even after the car stopped, the aches were strong. And then I saw him. We looked incredibly alike; <em>how did I completely forget</em>? All that distance and he was a wholly recognizable person, and the pain in my stomach vanished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The</strong> first person in the lobby outside the show was there five minutes early; many others were to follow. By 6 pm, dozens of people were flowing in, totaling more than two hundred by the night’s end. Frantic, I found myself imagining all the potential buyers: friends, colleagues, those with children, those alone. Some I knew as bosses, dominant in their fields, some as their students. Some who worked tech, some who hustled to make a living as artists. Many more whose lives I didn’t know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began rattling off three prices for each piece. A “low” for those on a budget, a “high” for those with so much more, and a “medium” for everyone in-between.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might feel awkward, “cumbersome,” and “soul-draining” to have to reflect on a choice that represents <em>my</em> art’s value. But that's a risk I make people take, for allowing me, the artist, to keep <em>all</em> of me in the work—including my soul.</p>

<p><strong>IT WAS RAINING WHEN WE EMERGED</strong> from the Metro and walked to the Holiday Inn on Rue de Lyon. With less than 24 hours before our train left Paris for Marseille, we dropped our backpacks and returned to the streets. A death in my girlfriend's family had brought us here. It was June, summer, and none of us had prepared for cold weather. We shivered in front of a half-burnt Notre Dame and a deserted Eiffel Tower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next morning we had time to visit the Musée de l'Orangerie. On our way I felt the gaze of Parisians looking us up and down. After more than a year of lockdowns, France had just opened up to travelers with a negative covid test and proof of vaccination. The pandemic had brought anguish but it had also rinsed the city of tourists. I imagined that everyone who saw the seven of us, like the scowling baker at the boulangerie in Bastille, was remembering how to be offended by our presence. Lockdown had left them rusty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d once thought of Claude Monet’s <em>Water Lilies</em> as the McDonald’s of the art world, up there with the Warhols and the Magrittes that you could find round the corner in any oofy art museum. When we entered the Orangerie, a Mecca for Monet devotees, I kept my feelings to myself. Built in 1852 to keep the orange trees of the Tuileries Palace warm in winter, this neoclassical greenhouse has shown eight large <em>Water Lily </em>murals–known as the <em>Nymphéas</em>–since 1927, the year after Monet’s death. On permanent display in two adjoining oval rooms, the paintings live, it has been said, in an architectural symbol of infinity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the private pond that inspired all of the works<em> </em>in his “Grand Decoration,”<em> </em>Monet wanted the Orangerie to be a sanctuary for the people of Paris, a place where, in his words, “those with nerves exhausted by work would relax.” Other wall texts repeated Monet’s desire, and by the time I sat in front of <em>Two Willows </em>(a 55-foot panel in the first room), having been told, in three translations, to relax, I could not. Perhaps I was distracted by small things, like a mutating virus, or the latest episode of war in Palestine. But soon enough I succumbed to the lavender waters of this “flowering aquarium” where light is God and lilies look like “melting ice creams,” as Kenneth Clark once said.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Clark was talking about Monet’s impressions of the Rouen cathedral, the way his thick brushstrokes dissolved each facade into vibrating puddles of cream. I saw the same effect in <em>Two Willows, </em>the “lilies” melting across a multi-dimensional universe of strawberry sundaes. Of course, I’d seen them a thousand times before—on mugs, postcards, t-shirts, chocolate boxes, puzzles, umbrellas, dildos, and diaries, not to mention the hyperreal sea of the Internet (and yes, there are NFTs). There in the Orangerie, my mind oversaturated with the history of these reproductions, the <em>real thing</em> felt like another copy. Monet’s innovations in form and perspective were frozen in old time. All I saw in <em>Two Willows</em> was a design for a phone case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1972 John Berger, borrowing from Walter Benjamin, warned that modern ways of reproducing art were lessening the actual artwork’s authority. With so many copies appearing in books and other media, he said, “images of art ha[d] become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free. They surround us,” he continued, “in the same way as a language surrounds us. They have entered the mainstream of life over which they no longer, in themselves, have power.” Berger was worried, maybe even paranoid. Once safe and protected in the museum, the empire of art was suddenly being set free by copies of itself. <em>Scary!</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fifty years on, in a world dictated by currents and currencies of images, I’m convinced the opposite is true: The real works of the <em>Nymphéas—</em>just like the original <em>Campbell’s Soup Cans</em> in the Museum of Modern Art and<em> The Scream</em> in the National Gallery—have never been more powerful. Instead of reducing the authority of the originals, millions of reproductions have been traveling the world like envoys, taking up space, and meeting me on mugs and clocks to advertise the supremacy of French art and “Frenchness” in general: Liberté, Egalité, <em>Water Lily</em>?</p>

<p>“Did you see the Magrittes downstairs?” my girlfriend asked when she and her family found me in the ultramarine waters of <em>Clear Morning with Willows</em>, which I had been staring at, hopelessly, for fifteen minutes to see if it “acknowledge[d],” à la Marienne Moore, “the spiritual forces which... made it.” In a final attempt to enter what Theodor W. Adorno described as the artwork’s “autonomous realm,” I stood as far away as possible. Camille Pissarro once decided that the best distance to view an Impressionist painting was three times the diagonal of the canvas. If Monet hadn’t been so ambitious—<em>Clear Morning with Willows </em>is 42 feet long—I might have found God.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, it became obvious that we needed to leave the gallery. Lunch was imperative, and the train to Marseille could not be missed. “But Magritte!” I said as I ran downstairs on the back of a promise that I would spend no more than five minutes in “Renoir/Magritte: Surrealism in Full Sunlight.” After reading the introductory wall text at a jog I proceeded to stop only momentarily in front of select paintings, like the reclining nude of <em>The Harvest</em>, whose colorful limbs and breasts looked more like the sleeves of a jester’s hat than the original Renoir.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time I made it to the last wall, my promise broken and my mind filled with more nudes than I bargained for, I had discovered a new side of Magritte, far removed from the faceless men and floating apples I studied in school. Robert Hughes once described this side as the “low point” of Magritte’s career, characterized by “impressionist fuzz and expressionist slather,” but I found a warmer take in the catalog. “In 1940, in a departure from his unusual and unsettling Surrealist style,” wrote Cécile Debray, Director of the Orangerie, “Magritte turned his attention to Renoir, ‘the painter of happiness,’ to banish the horrors and chaos of World War II and his experience of exile.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monet had reacted similarly to the First World War, only he had turned to his pond and its reservoir of light for solace. The final panels of those years lived upstairs, in the oval rooms, which Monet had, in a gust of patriotism, donated to France to celebrate the Armistice. As Ross King reveals in <em>Mad Enchantment </em>(2016), a fascinating book that charts the turbulent life of the <em>Water Lily</em> murals from beginning to end, Monet shared his wishes with Georges Clemenceau in 1918: “I am on the verge of finishing two decorative paintings,” he wrote in a letter, “that I want to sign on the day of Victory and have you offer to the State on my behalf.” He would call the panels his “war work.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Monet would give them no <em>Freedom of Mind, </em>as Magritte did in his painting of that name–a pensive, topless woman holding a pipe. Nor were there any angelic, winged penises floating among the lily pads, which Magritte drew for Georges Bataille’s <em>Madame Edward</em> and which I saw moments before returning to the family—tired, giddy, and dazzled by French verve: In what political universe, fashioned out of today’s magnificent mess, could an American curator hang such lovely <em>things</em>?</p>

<p>While the pernicious side effects of social media are being scrutinized in what passes for public conversation, the computer itself has assumed a more concealed state, touching everything we do, but conceived as an incredibly routinized, almost banal, part of our everyday lives. If, however, the computer is viewed not as ordinary, but <em>extra</em>ordinary, something beyond a tool, its impacts on our thinking and acting begin to reveal their true nature. Although commonly misappropriated as a mere “tool,” a key difference to note in this reframing is that the computer is in actuality not in the same category of technology as the wheel or the written word, which can both be conceptualized as tools since they serve very specific functions through very specific means. Rather, the computer is a collection of various tools, or, a <em>machine. </em>This condition alone creates a tangle of questions and implications in any attempt to understand not only how it is used, but how its use affects us.</p>

<p>Marx’s critical understanding of the emergent machines of his time, from looms to locomotives, reflects the relative simplicity of the mechanical assemblages themselves, especially when compared to the computer; nonetheless, his diagnosis of their effects is still relevant today:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">In handicrafts and manufacture, the worker makes use of a tool; in the factory, the machine makes use of him. There the movements of the instrument of labor proceed from him, here it is the movements of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the workers are the parts of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism which is independent of the workers, who are incorporated into it as its living appendages.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Prior to <em>Capital,</em> the machines were understood as nothing more than a sequential evolution of simple tools, at most combined in marginally more complex ways. Conversely, Marx observed that the difference between a tool and a machine is much more than a new arrangement of existing hardware; instead, it is a fundamental reorientation of the relationship between ourselves and the material world around us. In other words, what we work on works on us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Isolated to a contextual use inside the factory, the machine that Marx scrutinized affected a small amount of the population compared to today’s ubiquitous, “personal” computers and devices. An important translation of this idea to modern life, though he was writing exactly one century later, is McLuhan’s exponential thesis that “Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication.” While 19<sup>th</sup> century machines were imposingly physical, the ones of McLuhan’s era were increasingly psychological; today of course, ours are almost entirely digital.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More so than the unending abundance of “content” communicated by tech companies, the computer and the rapid acceleration of its transmission has drastically transformed our collective understanding of ourselves and society around us. As a tangential footnote, one recalls Hannah Arendt, in <em>The Human Condition </em>(1958),<em> </em>remarking on the speed-induced warping of our scalar perception in a newly globalized world:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The fact that the decisive shrinkage of the earth was the consequence of the invention of the airplane, that is, of leaving the surface of the earth altogether, is like a symbol for the general phenomenon that any decrease of terrestrial distance can be won only at the price of putting a decisive distance between man and earth, of alienating man from his immediate earthly surroundings.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Though not placing us “above the earth” per se, our world of the personal-digital inversely removes us, even if only cognitively, from the material world directly around us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notwithstanding the rapid evolution of other technologies from the 18<sup>th</sup> century onward, there can be little doubt that we live in a thoroughly digitized world, our daily experiences are mediated as deeply, if not as widely, through the digital as the material. In many cases, the two are indistinguishable; most of the physical material we interact with houses the infrastructure necessary to execute the various digital interfaces consuming our attention. But while all white-collar workers, and even most workers in the service industries, rely on computers to complete their tasks—add that children are nonchalantly handed tablets as a means of learning and distraction almost from the womb—there exists a group of practitioners who have a distinct form of material knowledge that is especially susceptible to the powerful forces of technological rapidity: artists and designers. While such epistemology has become mainstream, with scientists and writers stumbling upon the idea of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42291479-the-extended-mind""><em>learning outside the brain</em></a><em>,</em> this form of knowing is one that artists and designers have been privy to for centuries. No modern treatise depicts this reality better than chemist-turned-philosopher Michael Polanyi’s <em>The Tacit Dimension</em> (1966).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born in Hungary in 1891, Michael Polanyi pursued a polymathic career the like of which is now almost inconceivable. Initially developing several novel experiments and theories in various branches of physical chemistry, he worked in government, contributed to economic theory and eventually, through a chairship in the social sciences at the University of Manchester, arrived at philosophy. In 1962, Polanyi presented a series of lectures at Yale University, marking his transition from a decorated career in science to one in philosophy. Through an intimate understanding of scientific knowledge and discovery, Polanyi offered the insight at the heart of his preceding work, <em>Personal Knowledge</em> (1958): “We can know more than we can tell.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>The Tacit Dimension</em>, Polanyi spends less time focusing on what science and technology bring to our understanding of knowledge, than on how artists and other “creative” practitioners already work through similar ontological processes by means of their own special forms of making and thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rejecting the simplistic version of positivism (the belief that all knowledge can only be understood, and verified, through the “facts” of the experienced world), Polanyi instead asserted the clout of literature, the fine arts, and other “non-scientific” pursuits, emphasizing “the pressure exercised by literary and artistic circles is notorious.” In other words, while science and technology were continually creeping into all parts of society, Polanyi instead sought the arts as a place for better understanding our deepest forms of knowing. In chapter three, “Society of Explorers,” Polanyi meditates on the creative acts of seeking and recognizing problems:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Yet, looking forward before the event, the act of discovery appears personal and indeterminate. It starts with the solitary intimations of a problem, of bits and pieces here and there which seem to offer clues to something hidden. They look like fragments of a yet unknown coherent whole. This tentative vision must turn into a personal obsession; for a problem that does not worry us is no problem: there is no drive in it, it does not exist. This obsession, which spurs and guides us, is about something that no one can tell: its content is indefinable, indeterminate, strictly personal.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While some of these “bits and pieces” might have origins in familiar material, Polanyi argues that they are pointing toward that which is not yet known. Further, the intimation of a problem is a significant act in and of itself. If taken as a basis not only for knowing but also for acting and subsequently being, this assumption has far reaching consequences. Polanyi continues:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Indeed, the process by which it will be brought to light will be acknowledged as a discovery precisely because it could not have been achieved by any persistence in applying explicit rules given to fact. The true discoverer will be acclaimed for the daring feat of his imagination, which crosses uncharted seas of possible thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Tacit knowledge is less concerned with proposing a problem <em>a priori</em>, which seeks a solution that neatly fits within the original boundaries—a framework which our digital society so heavily relies on. In Polanyi’s view, artists are more akin to the explorers who set out with <em>some</em> understanding of where they might be going, content to encounter the unexpected, folding those unexpected things into the very direction and processes of the expedition itself. For the explorer, this might be never-before seen flora and fauna taking precedence over the original aims of material extraction; for the artist, an accidental smudge on the canvas can turn into the focus of the piece itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maintaining that these other spheres have as much, if not more, to offer society than science and technology, Polanyi draws parallels between the sciences and the arts, in that both can engage us in <em>active </em>seeking and discovery. Because of its dependence on binary functions, in this context it is nearly impossible to make a “mistake” on a computer, begging the question: Are there any spaces of truly free discovery in the digitized world?</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On display at a recent <a href=""https://whitney.org/exhibitions/julie-mehretu"">mid-career retrospective at the Whitney</a> Museum, Julie Mehretu’s gargantuan canvases—and her deliberately slow exploration of them—offer a portrait of an artist who has developed a creative process that is reliant on, but definitively not subservient to, the digital. Included in the show are videos of Mehretu’s meticulous construction of the paintings, not dissimilar in scale to muralists plotting their “canvases” on the sides of urban street-walls. Building upon layer after layer of digitally transcribed elements of architecture in pieces like <em>Mogamma (A Painting in Four Parts)</em> (2012), the collision of existing conditions generates spaces and forms upon which the artist can project their own vision into the sampled background.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More concretely, Mehretu’s most recent work, such as <em>Haka (and Riot)</em> (2019), begins with photographs of migration detention camps which, while scaled to sizes well beyond immediate recognition, still generate a willful and incredibly rich examination of the crisis. This “opacity,” as described by Mehretu—or an unwillingness to explicitly reproduce the photographs themselves and instead utilize them as a stratum for further exploration—subverts much of the precisely transmitted information technology is keen on piping to its users. Contrasted by the digitized world around us, with its promise of  “radical” transparency through unfettered access to unlimited content, Mehretu’s deliberate and intentional winnowing of such inputs is a model of more than just an alternative mode of artistic practice: It is a re-orientation of daily life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a practicing architect who also writes and draws, I have taken inspiration from Mehretu’s formal expression, as well as her slow dance with technology, a process which offers a necessary pause from the speed at which information is both ingested and shared. Herbert Marcuse suggests what creative acts might look like outside the hegemonic nature of imposed technology:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The tension between the ‘is’ and the ‘ought,’ between essence and appearance, potentiality and actuality … permeates the two-dimensional universe of discourse which is the universe of critical, abstract thought. The two dimensions are antagonistic to each other; the reality partakes of both of them, and the dialectical concepts develop the real contradictions.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">In this case, the “is” is the concrete, instructive reality of the act, or the direct subject matter. Conversely, the “ought” is the aspirational or suggestive character. A contradiction inherent in drawings made exclusively through the computer, unlike those Mehretu creates, is that although they can achieve hyper three-dimensional qualities on screen, in some cases even mimicking something closer to four-dimensional space because of the accelerated spatial and temporal viewpoints privileged to the user, the resultant drawing is a “one-dimensional” product, only indicating what “is,” and abdicating any notion of what “ought” to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My drawings, on the other hand, seek to avoid engagement with these types of flat lines, the likes of which constitute the one-dimensional quality Marcuse is wary of. This happens primarily through the use of manual means, the most simple and direct way to disengage with technology. Even though I use a projector as an underlay to trace source material, this in itself subverts the speed of the digital, since it would be much faster not only to avoid translating the material through a projector, but also to draw the lines within the computer itself. Instead, expanding the “distance” between the video and the screen creates an opportunity to find something that I might not quite understand, or, in Polanyi’s words, know but can’t say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My drawings are typically of the world around me, seen through the slowing down, or the expansion, of various patterns of movement. Both the material constraints—that of paper rather than screen—and the intentional deceleration of my experience of the content itself expand my opportunities for new discoveries and accidental occurrences. Drawing in this form can also be seen in terms of Marcuse’s “Great Refusal,” a direct rejection of that which <em>is</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it’s easy to admire a virtuosic talent like Mehretu, the odds are that most of us identify more with Marx’s “Struggle Between Worker and Machine” than with the life of an internationally acclaimed artist, whose honors include a Berlin Prize and a MacArthur Fellowship. Digital nihilism <em>appears </em>like a fulfillment of the utopian promises of tech, but the reality is a workforce—and a population at large—being consumed by the promised technology, like the machines of Marx’s time: an absolute grip on our attention, the commodification of data, and a surveillance of the habits that create our identities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the most innovative cultivators of our material world, artists, the picture hardly feels more hopeful. Instead of spending our days crafting the next canvas, or contemplating new media to use, most of us must struggle to fit these moments into the specialized working lives that allow us to support independent creative pursuits. Even if we are able to do so, the proliferating digital landscape means that with each piece of new technology or software, the attention required to manage it consumes yet more of our mental bandwidth, leaving artistic practice feeling even more like an afterthought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the digital revolution has led to an increase in efficiency of production for artists and designers, whether working for themselves or someone else, it has also profoundly <em>distanced</em> them from their actual productions. Complicating this remoteness from the “craft of making” is a corporitizing of the various technologies and tools used in so-called creative industries. Just as the 19<sup>th</sup> century factory worker was alienated from the means of production because the machinery was owned by someone else, so too the artist is alienated from the new-found digital means of production. Today, a handful of colossal corporations develop and own key pieces of software, thus enabling them to dictate the precise nature of<em> how </em>designers do their work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact is, for many of us avoiding the computer simply isn’t an option—it’s too intertwined with every aspect of our lives, not just in the ways we communicate but also in how we see and act. It’s quite tempting to romanticize an <a href=""https://www.searchlightpictures.com/thefrenchdispatch/"">age of grand ideas and narratives living through paper</a>, a comforting form of bookish escapism. But it’s too late to pretend we’re still living in a world held exclusively by the machinery of Gutenburg.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When these issues are translated to society at large, from how news media has become thoroughly atomized to how social media is affecting the development of social patterns in young people, claiming any source of agency feels nearly impossible. One thing that is possible, within our agency, is to become more careful observers, more aware of how we can slow dance with the machine, not only following, but dictating the pace ourselves. If we seek to make the computer an extension of us, rather than we an extension of it, we must continually examine our relationship, determining, for ourselves, where we fit between the material and digital. The <em>meaning</em> is the <em>medium</em>.</p>

<p><strong>IN THE DESERT THE AC HIT HARDER</strong>. I still hadn’t got used to the blast, that immediate freezing feeling when the doors to some interior slide apart and announce the arrival of a new and colder climate. In the concert hall the temperature change was even more pronounced, and although this was my second visit in as many days, I still wasn’t quite prepared for the size of the shiver.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d seen the Elvis hologram perform for the first time the previous evening. Now I was back, alone and sober, certain I had finally found the opening to my next book. Sitting there drinking a Diet Coke, I was still stunned by how lifelike the hologram was. Elvis’s movements were so languid—so exhausted, so unwell—it felt pointless resurrecting him for the performance. Why bring a man back from the dead only to have him phone-in another average show?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The approach prioritized realism over spectacle, and the result was this believably middling, three-star performance by a spent Elvis Presley. It was sometimes as if we were actually watching him—the corpse—brought forth from his coffin stiff and fatigued to stagger through one final Vegas show. At a cost of millions, perhaps tens of millions, they had faithfully approximated the experience of seeing Elvis Presley on an off-day, which although realistic, was also <em>realistically disappointing.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one nod to the present year were his speaking interludes, in which he thanked American Express for making the show possible and encouraged us all to leave the concert hall to collect refreshments from the bar. Carefully listing the options—“Snapple, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper…”—he seemed grateful for the opportunity to cease moving. I got the feeling he wished the list would never stop:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“...Diet Snapple, Diet Pepsi, Diet Dr. Pepper…”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there were only so many to name, and after the audience clapped at the climax of the menu Elvis wheezed back into song. He seemed to be having great difficulty summoning the energy to care. Even during the sequences for which he had been programmed to appear <em>more</em> interested, he still <em>appeared</em> clinically depressed. This was faithful to the real Elvis, though, with his interest reading not as fake, but rather as <em>realistically feigned, </em>as almost any interest of Elvis’s did after about 1970.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The feigned interest, belying a hollow <em>uninterest,</em> was an intensely realistic breed of interest. This was how Elvis really looked in interviews, at awards ceremonies, and on the old tour t-shirts that stretched his deathless grin across chest after chest, clinging on in cracked pieces starting to fade after too many circles through suburban washing machines. Over three decades the music industry had slowly sucked Elvis Presley dry of any genuine feeling, so this sterile hologram of him was, in its own way, oddly loyal to the real man; it was just that the real man was for almost three decades a counterfeit, mimicking a prototype who had died long ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the matinee I stepped back into the blazing sun and checked my iPhone. There was a message from my agent, Jay, reminding me that we had moved our meeting to three. I drove to the bar, passing the replicas of the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty looming over imported palms and more ads for AmEx. Spotify played through the speakers, with the joyless perfection of “Wagner,” “Eno,” and “Kanye West” bleakly underlining the appeal of two hours of Elvis butchering his hits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay had been ringing for months, eager for a chapter, an excerpt—anything to show the publisher. I had reassured him that, eventually, something would get written because I had already spent my advance, but he insisted this was a non-sequitur. In his experience, he said, a client spending their advance was not a reliable indicator of progress. “Although,” he continued, “it might, in your own case, be a reliable indicator of your drinking.” But this was all moot now anyway as I had finally found an opening to the book.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I</strong> had come to Las Vegas to visit Tim, an old friend Jay and I had in common. But something was making me linger. Jay suggested “free rent,” but I suspected the truth was more complicated. I often wandered through Tim’s penthouse with a vodka searching for it. “What am I doing here?” I’d ask myself. “Why?” I found Jay sitting at a table in front of the roadside bar where we had agreed to meet, vaping in a synthetic vanilla cloud that didn’t fully part until a nearby fan swiveled in our direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You told me this was a restaurant,” he said, as I dropped into the seat opposite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Are you hungry?” I asked him, looking around. “They might have nuts?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was beneath a parasol advertising Corona, himself sipping a Corona, while a device occasionally spraying water into the fan’s path coated him now and then in a cooling mist that clung briefly to his Ray-Bans before fading in the heat. I ordered a Corona also, before asking if he was able to expense this. He said he was. I stopped the bartender and asked for a vodka-tonic too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes I flirted with sobriety, but still hypnotized by the image of the Elvis hologram splashing a whisky sour around as he mumbled over the occasional forgotten lyric, I saw that to accurately present my vision for the book I needed to be in a comparable state, leaning into these flaws and obsessions that connected the pair of us to our shared audience. Overweight and addicted to painkillers, the resurrected Elvis was real—even though he was dead. The sweat pouring down his face as he, nonetheless, barely exerted himself physically, represented a level of collapse that every spectator could relate to. Elvis re-introduced the idea of a human at the wheel—however ill and confused. I needed to do the same. I assumed Jay already sensed this, and appreciated the idea that in many ways I was ordering far more than a “Corona'' and “vodka-tonic.” I was buying entry into something substantially bigger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You needn’t explain,” Jay said when my third Corona arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alcohol is the glue that—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’ve told me.” He held up a tired palm. “Hundreds of times.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Travel, leisure, events,” I continued. “We buy into these things almost purely to have an excuse to drink.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes,” Jay said, blankly. “Yes.” He sipped his Corona. “Tell me about Elvis instead. The novel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The novel<em>la</em>,” I corrected, mid-vape.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought it was a novel? Something ‘Dickensian,’ you said.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“Well, maybe it’s a memoir. I’m considering memoir too.”</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No. Just memoirs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I see,” he said. “Like—Barack Obama?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had a sip of my Corona. “Maybe ‘biography’ is the correct term: ‘autofiction,’ whatever.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay seemed suddenly ill, pale. “I think it’s an odd choice.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Writing memoirs, at your age. Is that normal? Are you dying?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We’re all dying, Jay.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Imminently?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Then why memoirs? You haven’t achieved anything.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What do you mean ‘achieved’?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I mean ‘achieved.’ You haven’t ‘achieved’ anything.”</p>

<p>“I’m thirty-five.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And it’s <em>because </em>my story isn’t notable that it has a chance to connect with a real audience.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But what <em>is</em> your story?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What my story is. What anyone’s story is.” I sipped my Corona.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But what do I tell the publisher?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Tell them it’s a book about ‘Life.’ And ‘Obsession.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I mean what’s it <em>about? </em>What happens?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Life happens.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Something has to <em>happen.</em>”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This is the locus of Elvis’s appeal today: people relate to how pathetic he is, not the ‘achievements.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You mean you do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Maybe, but there are millions of us.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Millions of pathetic people—this is your audience?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re aware Elvis had an illustrious career, right? Before this?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m aware of his ‘achievements.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jay paused. “<em>Elvis</em> could write memoirs—”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>“It’s biography, Jay.” I gestured with my vape vaguely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“—<em>You</em> can’t.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Biography,” I repeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Auto</em>biography,” he corrected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes, sorry, <em>auto</em>biography.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But <em>about</em> nothing? About you drinking in Vegas? Watching an Elvis show?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Life is not nothing, Jay.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I think you could afford to be more ambitious.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Than ‘life’ itself?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There are enough biographies about people drinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So what, a collection of short stories?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No. Another topic. I thought you emailed saying you were writing <em>about</em> Elvis? But now it sounds like you’re just writing about you, doing nothing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s about both of us. Elvis is a metaphor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s what you’ve been working towards for a whole year? A metaphor?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ten months.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s what you’ve been working towards for ten months?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes,” I said. I checked the time. Elvis’s next performance was beginning soon. “I have to go.” I stood up and necked the rest of my Corona and the last of another vodka-tonic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Doesn’t it play three times a day?” Jay asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Technology feeds our appetite for repetition,” I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I smiled knowingly, hoping that would be enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I don’t know,” I said. “I have to go.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Can we stay on topic for a second?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No.” I grabbed my keys off the table. “I’m already late. We’ll catch up after Elvis.” I squinted at the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re too excitable when you drink.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Things are finally falling into place, Jay.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No, they’re not. The opposite is happening. We are in the worst position we have ever been with this book. We need to sit down and think all of this through, very carefully.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“After Elvis.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Is driving wise?” Jay asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Are you able to expense this?” I gestured at the empty bottles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You already asked me that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes. But is driving wise?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On</strong> the drive back to the concert hall I wondered if Jay was right. Maybe I had drifted away from my original intention. But this was a good thing. The idea of writing a sprawling novel—something Dickensian, about the human condition—had sharpened more and more exquisitely into its perfect expression in these memoirs focussed mostly on my time in the desert. It didn’t matter if it had been done before. Elvis meant something—as did the drinking. There was an opening in the combination of the two, a symbolic moment that would put the pair of us in conversation: me and the hologram. I called Jay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Maybe you’re right about the memoir. Maybe it is strange. What about a screenplay?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I don’t think you should be making calls while driving,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re on the speakers,” I lied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But I can hear Elvis playing.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You’re both on the speakers.” A horn sounded while I passed a car too closely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How drunk are you?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It would still be me, still be real. We’d drive deep into obsession, just like you said.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>You</em> said that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’m talking about<em> </em>drinking, about obsession, Jay. That’s what I want this screenplay to address.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Your drinking?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Or fuck it,” I said, changing lanes. “A book of essays.” I exhaled more vapor. “Maybe this novel always was a book of essays. Or maybe an article.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“A Dickensian article?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Forget Dickens. A long-read. ‘The Writer in Vegas.’ <em>&nbsp;</em>Maybe that’s the perfect way for this thing to begin: as an article, in The New Yorker.<em> </em>We test the waters first and see if there’s the interest there <em>before</em> we waste any time on it. We get the confirmation. We can reach the maximum number of people this way.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Through The New Yorker?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The New Yorker,” I said, taking a right-turn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Sorry, I meant that as a question.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As a question?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As in: ‘The New Yorker, question mark?’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“‘The New Yorker?’,” he repeated, matching my tone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Yes,” I said, swinging a left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But what’s your question? I don’t understand.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I’ve forgotten. ‘Why not The New Yorker?’, I guess.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I guess <em>that</em> was my question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“You mean ‘what?’ was?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“What was?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Was ‘what? your question? What was your question?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” I said. “No. ‘What’ wasn’t. <em>Why </em>was. ‘Why not The New Yorker?’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“‘Why not The New Yorker?’” he repeated. “‘Why not The New Yorker?’… Didn’t <em>you </em>say The New Yorker?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I wanted your opinion—a second opinion.” I overtook a Toyota. “The point is that we get this article out there, circulating, and once we know there’s interest <em>then</em> we can look at adapting it into something longer. I want to reach as many people as possible.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“And I’m on the verge of something bigger with this Elvis breakthrough. A new way of working.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Ford was moving too slowly ahead of me and I ran into the back of it, crumpling the hood of my Mercedes. I lost Jay. Elvis was still struggling through “Suspicious Minds” on the stereo, his voice increasingly garbled by a disruption in the circuits. He sounded like he was dying in some slow and uncomfortable way. I pictured him on stage, squeezed into his white jumpsuit. Next there’d be a song from another decade that, just as garbled, might nonetheless offer a sense of continuity. A man in a cowboy hat was screaming at me through the steam clouding the windscreen. I guessed he was on his way to Elvis too.</p>

<p><strong>IT WAS SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE FIRST</strong> 10 rooms of the Centre Pompidou’s daunting exhibition on German art in the 1920s that I overheard a few people bracing themselves for the rest of this nearly 30-room, 900-piece show: <em>“Mais c’est énorme.” “Je n’en suis pas capable!”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simply naming it “Germany / 1920s / New Objectivity / August Sander,” the show’s curators seem to have lost stamina when coming up with a catchy title for the multimedia monster they'd mounted in the museum’s top-floor Galerie 1. More likely, however, they knew their show would speak for itself as an “exhibition within an exhibition,” where works of painting, sculpture, design, film, music, literature, and more encircle an expansive survey of the master photographer August Sander. Sure enough, by the time you’ve made it to the full reconstruction of one of Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky’s Frankfurt kitchens (whose compact, counter-based layout is now a given of urban dwelling), it’s clear you’re in a <em>Gesamtkunstwerk </em>of curation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first two pieces of the exhibition hang in a small corner nook: A 1913 self portrait by the Expressionist painter Ludwig Meidner and a 1914 photograph by Sander, <em>Young Farmers</em>. Meidner paints himself dark and distorted, as if on the verge of fading from view, while the strolling men in Sander’s renowned photo seem solid. But they’ve paused and their gaze is fixed on something in the distance, well out of their way. With the photo’s orientation on the first main room of post-war New Objectivity painting, is it the oncoming march of modernity?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The New Objectivity (<em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em>) movement in German art was named by the art historian Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub on the occasion of a 1925 exhibition he mounted in Mannheim, featuring contemporary painters such as Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, and George Schrimpf. At the Pompidou, wall tags indicate the 12 or so paintings here that were first presented in Hartlaub’s show, “New Objectivity: German Painting Since Expressionism.” In moving from the murky Meidner self-portrait to a Mannheim standout, Grosz’s <em>Portrait of the Writer Max Herrmann-Neisse</em> (1925), the shift that Hartlaub posited from Expressionism’s interiorized projections on the outside world to New Objectivity’s trust in the signifying force of realist depiction is clear. You observe Herrmann-Neisse’s head bulging with what must be writerly thoughts, while his body is almost wilted from their intensity. With the stark presence of the subject, you’re at pains to identify Grosz in this <em>sachlich </em>(objective) painting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hartlaub’s show was a hit in the press, so much so the name he chose took on a life of its own as a new shorthand for hip. It seems that by the late 1920s, every cabaret, theater, and boutique owner in the Weimar Republic hoped to have their operation designated <em>sehhhr sachlich </em>(“verrry objective”)<em> </em>by those in the know. Likewise, an expanding wave of artists, illustrators, designers, architects, writers and composers were haphazardly grouped by tastemakers under the New Objectivity label; by 1928, Hartlaub could only try to redefine the term as applicable to any artistic output that engaged the frothy atmosphere of interwar Germany.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the exhibit widens its scope beyond paintings from the artists that Hartlaub assembled (though they are generously peppered throughout the remaining rooms). A series of thematic sections—on standardization, montage, rationality, utility, and more—is a noble attempt to apply some order to the era. But what ultimately comes through are catalyzing contradictions: the cold minimalism of Bauhaus design (seen in furniture, scale models, and ephemera) against the warm crowd scenes of the cabaret; the growing emancipation and representation of the <em>Neue Frau</em> (as in Lotte Lasertein’s portraits, like <em>Russian Girl with a Compact</em>) against the reactive rise of misogynist <em>lustmord </em>(sex murders) with their depiction by major male artists; and the productive conflicts within forms and mediums, as photography and literature strived for the effect of Dadaist collage (see how the novelist Alfred Döblin pasted publicity and newspaper clippings all over the manuscript of his masterpiece <em>Berlin Alexanderplatz</em>) and, in sound, Walter Ruttman surpassed the durational limits of recording technology by turning to synch-sound film roll to make long, imageless audio collages of city life (as in his 1930 piece <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfGdlajO2EQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>Week-end</em></a>).</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Hartlaub’s show was a hit in the press, so much so the name he chose took on a life of its own as a new shorthand for hip [...] <em>sehhhr sachlich </em>(“verrry objective”)</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Rooms and rooms of vital arts and crafts are linked seemingly without end, and the effort to organize them echos the same schematizing intentions of certain Weimar theorists, designers, and architects cited in the show—a desire for order after the horrors of the First World War, soon to be hijacked by Hitler’s rise in the 1930s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Running as a sort of inner loop to the outer loop described above, a singular focus on the work of photographer August Sander (1876–1964) is another curatorial coup. Centered on what remains of his unfinished project <em>People of the 20th Century</em>, for which he endeavored to take portraits of the various “typologies” of German people from 1910 to about 1939, this section of the exhibit cleverly stands as a literal human core to the intensely varied forms of aesthetic representation surrounding it, all of which took the same populace as its subject.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With his goal of creating a “momentary portrait of the German” (a snapshot in the truest sense), Sander plotted out a complex series of groupings and sub-portfolios like <em>The Woman in Intellectual and Practical Occupations, The Performing Musician, </em>and <em>Farming Types,</em> ultimately printing around 600 photos. The last of these he assembled as <em>The Persecuted</em> and <em>Political Prisoners</em> portfolios from negatives taken by his son Erich before Erich’s death in 1944 at Siegburg Prison, where he was a left-wing political prisoner.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Taken together, Sander’s consistently humanistic photographs have the most staying power in this crowded and cacophonous show. While they indeed make up only a “momentary portrait,” what makes Sander’s project all the more arresting is <em>the</em> <em>moment</em>, before the Weimar Republic’s unraveling and the outbreak of the Second World War: His varied, enigmatic subjects sit as if on a fragile seam joining the long past and our present-day future. By the same token, there is an eerie sense of folly and foreshadowing in his unfinished taxonomy; that is, man’s folly in attempting a comprehensive classification of the world around him (the kind explored generations earlier in <em>Moby-Dick, </em>where the scientific chapters that fall short of a complete cetology mirror Ahab’s doomed quest) alongside the looming machinations of the Nazi party that would soon stratify German society—and Europe—for their own purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In an early room of the show, the 1928 cabaret hit <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3oNfe4ZpO4&amp;t=38s"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">“It’s in the Air”</a> plays from hidden speakers while its lyrics, which charmingly observe a change of atmosphere in Germany (“Things were so different back in the day!”), are posted in large print on a nearby wall; there’s something silly, fiery, thorny, and hypnotic going on, you hear. Today, this overwhelming exhibit still begs the question—what <em>was</em> in the air back then? Maybe trauma, debauchery, or nihilism?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or perhaps a natural evolution, an outgrowth from the interiority of pre-war Expressionism and the collective release of a people liberated from monarchical rule. The eponymous cabaret-hopping protagonist of Erich Kästner’s zippy 1931 novel <em>Fabian: The Story of a Moralist</em>, a crisp first edition of which dutifully pops up in the exhibit, calls the Europe he’s living in—the Europe of the late 1920s— “a great waiting room” for some impending upheaval: “We live provisionally,” he warns. “The crisis goes on without end!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exhibition ends with <em>Reversals</em>, a new room-sized installation by contemporary photographer Arno Gisinger. He projects archival photos of paintings as they were hung in Hartlaub’s groundbreaking 1925 exhibition, and overlays photos of their placement, 8 years later, in the exact same museum when they appeared in the initial Nazi-organized “exhibitions of shame” against so-called Degenerate Art. Indeed, there can be no offsetting the crises that came before and after the comparatively peaceful 1920s on display at the Pompidou. It’s not exactly for art to offset, but, if it succeeds, to exist beyond the fray of historical reaction, whether its own or others’.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And even as crises seem to arrive in an endless parade today, nearly a hundred years later, anyone hoping for a Roaring Twenties redux to follow the pandemic, bouts of authoritarian incompetence, and now rising global inflation is being willfully flippant toward history. Happily, the curators at the Pompidou do not make such a thematic stretch. Instead the many outlets of artistic expression in the exhibit and the way they resist collective categorization emphasize the subjectivity that protects and elevates great art of any era. Alluring, impenetrable, shocking, and monumental, “Germany / 1920s / New Objectivity / August Sander” hits the same notes as its four-headed, century-old subject.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Wander into any “service” bar in any major city after the trendiest restaurants have emptied out and you’ll find a fertile scene of lively, mesmerizing individuals—servers, hosts, bartenders, cooks—and something quite like a subculture. Often driven by habit and need of money, they embrace the intoxicating mix of the restaurant industry’s secret privileges, irregular hours, and gritty cosmopolitan allure. Unlike a conventional art movement, however, the memorable work they’re creating is intended to be consumed organically before being reproduced, hour after hour, night after night. Hence, like film, it is an industrial artform, hiding in plain sight. The restaurant (as sustenance, rendezvous, watering hole) has always played an integral role in the life of art—and artifice. Now, just as then, the restaurant scene thrives when it's the place to be seen. Appropriately, it also feeds today’s insatiable digital appetite that, curiously, serves to validate our reality. —Marius Sosnowski</p>

<p><strong>MY DAD NEVER OFFERED ME MUCH ADVICE</strong> when I was growing up. The one warning he did give me, though, was: “Don't work in restaurants.” I was about sixteen and excited about this café job I had just landed around the corner from where I grew up. We could drink an unlimited supply of coffee, and it paid (relatively) well (plus tips)—I really didn't need much else. That job got me through highschool and into college. At a certain point I transitioned into real restaurants: bussing, hosting, food running, and serving. My dad’s one piece of wisdom had fallen on deaf ears. By the time I was well into college I was working full-time in restaurants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the late 1960s my godmother and her husband moved to New York City from the French countryside of Brittany. Together, they worked every conceivable position restaurants had to offer until the day they opened their own establishment, La Vie Oberge. In the 1980s-90s, NYC witnessed a huge boom in French restaurants which became the gateway for my aunts, uncles, cousins, and my father to leave Brittany for a foothold in America. Meanwhile, my mother waited tables at popular restaurants throughout the city, even playing piano at a few. My parents continued to work in that world until just before I started the café job.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I graduated college with a degree in photography. And yet, I felt a strong pull toward the restaurant world. When I was offered the chance to work at an upscale restaurant in Chelsea, I was all-in. It was bigger than any restaurant I had ever worked in, busier, faster paced, and patronized by famous actors and musicians every night. Behind the scenes, the restaurant ran on a creative energy its wildly artistic staff emitted like radioactivity. Restaurants have long served as stopovers for aspiring actors, comics, ceramicists, yoga instructors, photographers<em>, </em>videographers, painters, and creative young chefs with dreams of opening their own places. Waiters from the midwest, porters from Africa, chefs from Central America, Japan, and Guam. At times it felt like we were all some motley crew on a pirate ship, each with homes and ports of call somewhere, playing up some raucous role in the meantime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Working in restaurants was supposed to be a short stop over. Yet the transient, explosive, and&nbsp; wild-eyed artistic energy of its world became my home for many years. It allowed me to work out west in California and back again, and to meet some of the strangest, most creative, authentic and most beautiful people imaginable. Extremely stimulating and extremely taxing at the same time, there is no other job quite like a restaurant job.</p>

1751,"Some Los Angeles Dingbats","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN JULY 1975, ED RUSCHA</strong> recalled a dream in which he drove out west and moved into an apartment in Los Angeles. “I pulled into Hollywood off a palm-lined street and tucked my car under an apartment house overhang carport whose front end featured 3-D show-card slash script letters that spelled out ‘SWANK.’” It didn’t happen exactly that way, but the Nebraska-born, Oklahoma City-bred artist did, like many design practitioners working in the mid-1950s, move to Los Angeles and find a creative Mecca. This westward push led to the first survey exhibition of Pop art, held at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1962. Curated by Walter Hopps, “New Paintings of Common Objects” featured Ruscha as well as fellow canonical Pop artists Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ruscha’s attentiveness to more common architecture is evident in his photographic documentation and painted renderings of domestic and commercial structures across the Western United States. When British architectural historian Reyner Banham interviewed Ruscha in his 1972 travel guide to the city, <em>Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles</em>, the artist suggested tourists visit its gas stations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the exuberant signage to the garage underneath the house, it is evident, even without Ruscha’s naming it, that the apartment the artist settles into in his dream is one of the city’s most easily recognizable architectural achievements: the dingbat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>The apartment complexes can range in style from Tiki to Mansard to Googie but they always reference the fantastic or the far flung. The wide range of styles that dingbat architecture draws from seems to give credence to Frank Lloyd Wright’s tongue-in-cheek theory that if the earth was tipped, “everything loose [would] land in Los Angeles.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In the mythology of the dingbat, Banham is effectively responsible for popularizing the term. Yet few people, even the hundreds of thousands who inhabit these complexes, realize this architectural species has a name. The style emerged in Southern California in the early 1950s and reached its peak in the late 1950s and 1960s. In his 1971 dissection of the city, <em><a href=""https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520260153/los-angeles"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies</a></em>, Banham distinguishes the style as a two-story wooden box structure glazed in stucco that fills any lot it is placed on. With these “boxes” all the interest is dedicated to its façade, while its other three sides are often left blank.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A near requirement of the dingbat type is a fanciful name accompanied by ornate typographic signage visible from the street. The names often evoke exotic places or edifices much grander than their simple construction would suggest. Names such as “Vista Capri” (3906 Inglewood Boulevard) and “La Traviata” (1138 Euclid Street) are followed by superimposed designs meant to fortify the evocation. The apartment complexes can range in style from Tiki to Mansard to Googie but they always reference the fantastic or the far flung. The wide range of styles that dingbat architecture draws from seems to give credence to Frank Lloyd Wright’s tongue-in-cheek theory that if the earth was tipped, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/opinion/sunday/i-love-la.html [accessed on 30 November 2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">“everything loose [would] land in Los Angeles.”</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is unsurprising that the name and typography of an apartment complex would feature prominently in the dreams of an artist who started out as a draftsman for an advertising agency—not unlike his fellows, Warhol and Lichtenstein. “SWANK” in particular seems to speak directly to dingbat architecture and its faux-luxe posturing, hankering as it does to impress us. In a 2015 interview with Jonathan Griffin, the artist mentioned that what attracted him most to Los Angeles was its “swank mentality” and “tropical flash.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s understandable that people generally dislike the dingbat for its particular brand of kitsch, full of embellishments and superfluous ornamentation. But Ruscha didn’t perceive these traits negatively. In fact, the city’s sense of artifice and its particular predilection for ever-changing culture was what attracted him most.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within this fast-paced environment, LA is notorious for its architectural turnover. Many of the dingbat’s one-story structures have been torn down to make room for larger occupancy three-story buildings. Several artists turned to documenting the architectural style precisely because of its impermanence, most notably by Ruscha in the 1960s, photographer Judy Fiskin in the 1980s, and more recently Lesley Marlene Siegel in the 1990s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In Ruscha’s third artist book, <em><a href=""https://shop.getty.edu/products/ed-ruscha-and-some-los-angeles-apartments-978-1606061381"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Some Los Angeles Apartments</a></em> (1965), several dingbats are featured within the thirty-four photographs of apartment complexes. Each image is taken from the street, usually less than 100 feet from the structure. Ruscha held his camera, a Yaschica twin-lens reflex, at waist height and determined the shot by looking downward into a focusing screen. Ruscha’s photographs place us, the viewer, as if we were driving by in a car.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This symbiotic relationship between the dingbat and the car—an essential feature of all mid-century Los Angeles urban planning—is conveyed in the way Ruscha describes the experience of peering out the window in his dream: “As I looked out [...] I could see part of the letter ‘S’ together with the tail-end of my Ford Victoria hardtop convertible.” The typeface bleeds into the car’s design, fusing automobile and architecture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>John Chase argues that the dingbat type owes more to consumer products than to preceding architectural styles. Instead, Chase perceives the eccentric color combinations typical of dingbat apartments as an ode to the advertising and automobile industries. This aspect of the dingbat has prompted writers to associate the style with Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown’s notion of the “decorated shed.” While studying the particular urban phenomenon of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1960s, Venturi and Brown coined the moniker to distinguish utilitarian buildings that rely on flashy signage or ornament to advertise what’s inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Despite the dingbat’s claim to foreign styles, its ornamentation locates it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">This reading would seem to suggest that the dingbat is a byproduct of mundane consumerism. However, despite their similar starting points, the dingbat’s walls speak more strongly of individualism than generic reproduction. Chase discusses the new precedence set by dingbat architecture in terms of experimentation in stucco. By streaking patterns through the material or adding aggregate and color to the plaster, the buildings are subtly distinguished, more craft-like than mass-produced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The accompanying signage of each complex also alludes to its owner’s personal aesthetic. Each fantastical name acts as an identifier. At times the dingbat signs are simply street address numbers blown up in typographic fanfare. Despite the dingbat’s claim to foreign styles, its ornamentation locates it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike architectural styles that are characterized by specific exterior elements, the dingbat does not have a corresponding interior aesthetic. Dingbats, as rented spaces which alter according to the preferences of its rotating tenants, are ever-changing. Its interiors are best illustrated in Tamara Jenkins’s 1998 cult classic, <em>Slums of Beverly Hills</em>, where a Jewish family moves from one dingbat to the next, avoiding rent while pursuing social gain. The nomadic life of its tenants is conveyed by its near empty rooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But does the dingbat even have a future? The LA Forum held a competition in 2010 to imagine a 21st century form of “dingbat-ness” for the dated yet hardly old design. In lieu of preservation or restoration, the winning project, entitled “Microparcelization,” called outright for the type’s destruction. Microparcelization proposes to update the dingbat’s contributions to sustainable urban living through smaller housing units, in effect calling for “tiny houses” or ADUs. By dividing land parcels, housing is slightly more affordable and buying becomes more feasible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 1970s Banham similarly saw the dingbat as Los Angeles’s solution to population density and the ever-present desire for “the illusions of homestead living.” But given Los Angeles’s history of architectural turnover, the winning architects’ call to destroy many of the dingbats before we “get soft and start to miss them” seems shortsighted. With <em>Some Los Angeles Apartments, </em>Ed Ruscha preserved a moment in time when Los Angeles’s last housing shortage seemed resolved. If we are, in fact, experiencing another housing crisis, what will the essence of dingbat-ness look like from the windows of our all-electric vehicles?</p>

<p><strong>MY ARMENIAN RELATIVE TIGRAN</strong> Demurjian, who was born and raised in San Francisco, recently graduated from UC Berkeley. Related as I am to him through an Armenian first cousin, the occasion was personally a very happy one for me, setting off an instructive conversation with his grandmother Jeanna.&nbsp;Jeanna, I discovered, had been born in 1941 of a Ukrainian father and Jewish mother in the former Ukrainian Soviet Republic.&nbsp;Her first two years of life were spent in hiding as the Nazis devastated the Ukraine in their racist campaign to literally kill all Jews while simultaneously reducing all Slavs—Ukrainians included—to abject slavery.</p>

<p>Far removed from the benign oscillations of San Francisco Bay Area life? One might wish to think so, but if California, with the Bay Area serving as one of its driving economic pistons, forms part of a global network of states and forces at play—as it surely is—then the Ukraine with its present struggles and sufferings against a neo-Tsarist aggressor is not just something “over there somewhere,” and the San Francisco-based Demurjians are not merely evidence of passing ephemeral connections. For that matter it might be worth noting that this same self-identified “Russian” colossus that is trying to pound the Ukraine—an internationally recognized independent sovereign state—back into the Stone Age remains a scowling California neighbor just across the Pacific from here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did I say “Russian”?&nbsp; But who arrogated that right to the former denizens of “Muscovy”?&nbsp;Apparently it was Peter the Great who by 1721 had changed the title of his imperial state to the “Empire of Russia.”&nbsp;Prior to that it had been simply “Muscovy” bullying its way into an eastern Europe occupied at that period by such far more humanistically-constituted cultural powers as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and elements of an Ukrainian independence movement led by Bohdan Khmelnyts’kyi. In the long run the Muscovites overwhelmed both the Commonwealth and swallowed up Kmelnyts’kyi’s Ukraine, after which a host of Ukrainian intellectuals in Kyiv taught the Moscow interlopers the legacy of a time-honored “Rus’.” Prior to all that the Grand Dukes of Lithuania had historically considered themselves the true rulers of “Rus’” and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had kept open its claim over that title well into the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>So who or what is “Rus’”? Often associated with a Viking (“Varangian”) named Rurik descending via boat from Scandinavia into the “land of five rivers” between the Baltic and Black Seas, it was appropriated by the occupants of the varied city-states of Kyiv in the early middle ages.&nbsp; For those states, cultural and spiritual impetus came regularly from the south through the Byzantine or East Roman Empire centered on Constantinople and controlling much of the eastern Mediterranean—successor in short to the cultural traditions of the ancient Roman Empire and classical antiquity on which Western civilization is largely based. Thus Constantine/Cyril, presumed co-originator of the “Cyrillic” alphabet brought to the Slavs, had occupied the chair of philosophy in the higher schools of Constantinople. Converting to Orthodox Christianity in 988 CE, the Kyivans became major transmitters of Christian proselytizers bringing Christian religion, spirituality, and culture into these same areas of Eastern Europe.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Kyivan system slowly disintegrated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries with Kyiv itself demolished by the ransacking Mongol Empire in 1241. “Ruthenia,” a Latinism derived from “Rus’,” was typically applied to the region even into modern times with “Ukraina” originally used from 1600 on as a vague military term for the Orthodox in Poland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the survivors of the Mongol onslaught were the occupants to the northeast of an unimportant entity, Moscow, which through subsequent accommodations to the Mongols’ successors, the so-called Golden Horde, pieced together a political power whose proudest representative came to be labeled “Ivan the<em> Terrible</em>”—a nickname that can just as easily be applied to such worthy successors over time as Josef Stalin and Vladimir Putin. This antagonist only had at hand standards of autocracy and variants of concentration camps—the fabled “Gulag Archipelago” of the Bolshevik period furnishing a pristinely unholy example—redolent of hierarchically intolerant societies and governance not uncommon to regimes affected by Mongol dominance. Its hated opponent was the European and classical culture that such eastern European entities as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had, for all their own shortcomings, sponsored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus the present conflict between “Russia” and the “Ukraine” is the latest version of an historic rivalry. Indeed, properly articulated, the struggle should be more exactly reframed as no less than the real “Rus’”—the present-day Ukraine—versus something summed up as “Muscovy”: liberal society against the same bundle of intolerance and aggression that has haunted eastern Europe since the Mongols and presently justifies worries for my own California and the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often enough what takes place in “a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing”—British prime minister Neville Chamberlain’s offhand dismissal of Czechoslovakia in the course of his fatal 1938 appeasement to Nazi Germany that helped precipitate the Second World War—comes “home” much sooner than foreshadowed.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>THE ROMANS OF CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY</strong>, from the age of Augustus to the reigns of Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, abided in the Virgilian promise of an empire without end, but the Byzantines always knew they lived on borrowed time. A popular version of the Christian apocalypse told of a 1000-year Empire, of final days and a last emperor—a prophecy that, in the event, came true, but with a heart-catching fifth act.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Constantine the Great having inaugurated his New Rome on the site of ancient Byzantium, 11 May 330, it was not unexpected that the Empire would endure past AD 1000, a date which quickened doomsday expectations elsewhere in Christendom. At the millennium, Constantinople was the most opulent and populous city in the Western world, ruling a compact and defensible empire in Asia Minor, the Balkans, and the Aegean, having survived sieges, famine, plagues, and miscellaneous catastrophes since its foundation. In the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century the world-famous historian Arnold J. Toynbee addressed the mystery of how Byzantium survived when other medieval regimes did not by declaring the whole thing was an illusion. The Greek Empire, he argued, actually died in 602 when the decent but parsimonious Maurice was deposed by a brutish centurion, Phocas, best known for his ghoulish innovations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was Phocas,” quoting John Julius Norwich, “who introduced the rack, the blindings and the mutilations which were to cast so sinister a shadow over the centuries to come.” Hitherto, the Empire had not been particularly cruel by the standards of the day; certainly not as gruesomely imaginative in this department as it now became. Toynbee, who started out as a Byzantinist, maintained that only a “ghost” of the Empire was revived by the low-born emperor Leo III (reigned 717-741), who routed Arab invaders by land and sea, only to throw Byzantium into confusion and turmoil with his iconoclasm. The gigantic revenant that he left behind&nbsp;stumbled along for another three centuries until the battle of Manzikert in 1071, after which Byzantium was an empire only by courtesy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back in the 1920s, H. G. Wells had explained the gigantic civilizational reversals of fortune in the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> centuries that<em> almost</em> overwhelmed Byzantium in the racialist terms then in vogue:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">A thousand years before, the Aryan-speaking races were triumphant over all the civilized world west of China. Now the Mongol had thrust as far as Hungary, nothing of Asia remained under Aryan rule except the Byzantine dominions in Asia Minor, and all Africa was lost and nearly all Spain. The great Hellenic world had shrunken to a few possessions around the nucleus of the trading city of Constantinople, and the memory of the Roman world was kept alive by the Latin of the Western Christian priests. In vivid contrast to this tale of retrogression, the Semitic tradition had risen again from subjugation and obscurity after a thousand years of darkness.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">In the <em>Decline and Fall</em>, Gibbon pauses in the 7<sup>th</sup> century to give a gloomy preview of what is to follow:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">From the time of Heraclius, the Byzantine theatre is contracted and darkened; the line of empire, which had been defined by the laws of Justinian and the arms of Belisarius, recedes on all sides from our view; the Roman name, the proper subject of our inquiries, is reduced to a narrow corner of Europe, to the lonely suburbs of Constantinople; and the fate of the Greek empire has been compared to that of the Rhine, which loses itself in the sands before its waters can mingle with the ocean.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But riverine analogies are doubtful in human affairs, even—perhaps especially—when deployed by a genius like Gibbon. In&nbsp;flesh and blood the Empire endured, and in the fifty-year reign of Basil II (976-1025), it glittered again and grew. Born in the purple, Basil was a philistine compared to his forebears, his grandfather Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the “Scholar-Emperor,” and great-grandfather Leo the Wise.&nbsp;Physically unimposing, uninterested in art or theology, and apparently indifferent to sex, Basil <em>was</em> a military genius who vastly enlarged on the triumphs in the Arab-Byzantine wars that had begun in his father’s reign with the recovery of Crete, after 136 years. Confronted with the latest hostile arrivals to the northeast, he&nbsp; became known to history as <em>Bulgaroktonos,</em> “the Bulgar-Slayer”—although his most famous dealing with the Bulgars was not slaying but blinding 15,000 captives and, sparing one in a hundred as guides, sending them home: legendarily, their king dropped dead at the sight. The Bulgar-Slayer was impatiently mounting an invasion of Arab-occupied Sicily when he died in 1025, unexpectedly leaving an empire at peace, as Romilly Jenkins writes in <em>Byzantium: The Imperial Centuries</em> (1966):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">As far as the eye could reach, both west and east, the sky was serene and unclouded. Storms were gathering below the horizon, but who could foretell this? Far off in Transoxiana, east of the Aral, things might be unquiet, but the eastern frontier was splendidly fortified. In South Italy the Normans had shown their mettle, but they were no more than a handful, and as yet submissive to Byzantium. Mutterings could be heard from enslaved Bulgaria, but surely Basil had not spent fifty years for nothing in settling that problem? The conclusion seemed to be that no extraordinary efforts need be made to foster and strengthen the military arm.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Constantinople’s quarrelsome, riotous, and enterprising citizenry prospered behind huge, apparently impregnable walls. While preserving the arts and letters of antiquity for another day (it was the “Macedonian Renaissance”), the Empire remained the bulwark of the crude, ungrateful kingdoms of the Latin West. Even Gibbon concedes, “An historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the tenth century.” By comparison, “the cities of the West had decayed and fallen; nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and narrow precincts of Paris and London prepare the Latin stranger to contemplate the situation and extent of Constantinople, her stately palaces and churches, and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">The arts of mosaic and painting glorified the church, while in Byzantium’s factories were manufactured the silks and brocades, the gold-, silver-, and enamelware which were for sale in a mile-long shopping district, partially lit at night. In literature Latin was a lost cause, but scholarship advanced the recovery of Greece’s classical past: Platonism (of a sort) was revived, and poetry from Homer on was collected in the immortal <em>Greek Anthology</em>. The most compendious account of the Empire’s provinces (<em>themes</em>) was assembled by that most studious autocrat, the emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus; its dynastic history was chronicled by the courtier, encyclopedist, sometimes eye-witness Michael Psellus in his <em>Chronographia </em>(usually translated as <em>Fourteen Byzantine Rulers</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Always Gibbon comes back to his melancholy theme, the “Solitude of the Greeks.” The Byzantines considered the “barbarians,” such as the Slavs and Avars who harassed them in the North, to be scarcely human; the “more polished” Arabs spoke a difficult language and practiced an alien religion; their Christian brethren in the West were ill-mannered. The multitudes of Constantinople were a lonely crowd who had nothing to say to anybody else, and nothing they wanted to hear. “Alone in the universe, the self-satisfied pride of the Greeks was not disturbed by the comparison of foreign merit; and it is no wonder if they fainted in the race, since they had neither competitors to urge their speed nor judges to crown their victory.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, what a realm they inhabited, or believed they did! It was this millennial Greek Empire, not the rougher Empire of late antiquity, that was rediscovered and celebrated in 20<sup>th</sup> century art, literature, and historiography—a “rediscovery” epitomized in the gilded décor of W. B. Yeats’s “Sailing to Byzantium, ”the escape story of the poet from death into the “artifice of eternity”:</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">Once out of nature I shall never take<br>
My bodily form from any natural thing,<br>

To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br>
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.</p>

<p><strong>FROM</strong> his drab work clothes to his indifference to art or heirs, Basil II was, as says John Julius Norwich, “deeply un-Byzantine”; he never married and died childless. Constantine VIII, his younger brother and successor, <em>was</em> deeply Byzantine in the prejudicial sense of self-indulgence and casual cruelty. On his death-bed Constantine was persuaded to decree the marriage of his daughter Zoe, a virgin of 50, to an elderly senator who—to abridge a long story—had a brief reign and suffered a suspicious death, immediately followed by the empress’s overnight marriage to a handsome youth who came from from Paphlagonia on the Black Sea. The teenaged brother of an influential court eunuch, Michael IV, as the boy became, ruled capably and campaigned bravely, until his early death from complications of epilepsy and dropsy. For thirty years or so, “the indefatigable Zoe,” as Gibbon calls her, ruled through husbands and favorites, some of them pressed on her by the court, others perhaps mere whims, while an over-ambitious patriarch successfully pursued a schism with the pope in Rome; by popular demand she was eventually joined on the throne by her detested younger sister, Theodora, a nun, who outlived her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Byzantium was indulging these dynastic dramas, the Seljuk Turks, prodded forward by more volatile Mongols, were advancing in Anatolia. In 1071, the emperor Romanus IV Diogenes met them in battle in Manzikert, was defeated and captured; he was ransomed under humiliating terms, but the Empire never recovered. In a day Anatolia was lost, and Byzantium ceased to be a great power.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN</strong> the rational 18<sup>th</sup> century, Byzantium got a bad notice from Gibbon, hundreds of pages long, its conclusion: “In the revolution of ten centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity or promote the happiness of mankind.” Nothing if not sweeping;&nbsp; and in the moralistic 19<sup>th </sup>century, W. E. H. Lecky delivered a yet more thunderous dismissal in his <em>History of European Morals</em> (1869):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Of the Byzantine Empire the universal verdict of history is that it constitutes with scarcely an exception, the most thoroughly base and despicable form that civilization has yet assumed… There has been no other enduring civilization so absolutely destitute of all the forms and elements of greatness, and none to which the epithet mean may so emphatically be applied. The Byzantine Empire was pre-eminently the age of treachery. Its vices were the vices of men who had ceased to be brave without learning to be virtuous… The history of the Empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests, eunuchs and women, of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform ingratitude, of perpetual fratricides.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">“The language is such a western Crusader of the twelfth century might have held, and often in fact did hold, about Byzantium,” the English Byzantinist Romilly Jenkins retorted a century later.&nbsp; “It is the outcome of the deplorable strife between Eastern and Western Christendom which begat in the West a long-standing hatred of Byzantium, still plainly discernible in the pages of the historians Gibbon and Voltaire, and of the novelists Walter Scott and George Eliot.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Into the first half of the 20<sup>th </sup>century, a period which&nbsp;witnessed the geographical high noon of European empire and the nascence of the American, multicultural Byzantium—with its African, Macedonian, and Armenian emperors interspersed among the Greek, its simple qualifications for participation in its public life of speaking Greek and professing Orthodoxy, its magnificent devotional arts, its military and technological feats (“Greek fire”), and diplomatic dexterity—remained the great historical Other to the modern nationalist and ethnocentric West. Especially before the First World War, Byzantium’s&nbsp;blood-stained imperial cult, in which battles of succession routinely ended in the blinding and mutilation of the loser, and, no less, its sophisticated bureaucracy were alien to the ruling classes’ overall muscular Christian idea of themselves in Paris, London, and New York—the lowest blow struck by Theodore Roosevelt in the presidential election of 1912 was calling Woodrow Wilson a “Byzantine logothete.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scene changes after the Great War, which disillusioned its survivors and the younger generation alike. It was not coincidental that correcting the philistine Victorian prejudice against Byzantium became the cause of a cadre of brilliant young British philhellenes, most famously, Robert Byron, Steven Runciman, and Patrick Leigh Fermor. They were part of a privileged lot, mostly born in the reign of Edward VII, who (Byron and Runciman at least) would later comprise the gang of Bright Young Things chronicled and satirized by Evelyn Waugh in his early novels <em>Decline and Fall</em> and <em>Vile Bodies</em> and, later, romanticized in <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>. Their inheritance was Empire, which, as surely as Byzantium’s prophets had told <em>their </em>contemporaries, they were destined to lose.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Enabled by their “entitlement” in 20<sup>th </sup>century Britain’s much briefer imperium, the philhellenes advanced an historical enterprise going back to George Finlay, Lord Byron’s comrade in the Greek War of Independence.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">After graduating from Merton College, Oxford, Byron (no relation to the poet) made his first journey to Greece in 1925, driving across Europe to Athens with two friends, sustained by chicken in aspic and other provisions from Fortnum &amp; Mason, a journey recorded in a novice book <em>Europe in the Looking-Glass</em>. His second voyage&nbsp; was a pilgrimage to the monasteries at Mount Athos which is told in <em>The Station</em> (1928), a small classic. <em>The Byzantine Achievement</em> followed in 1929, <em>The Birth of Western Painting</em> in 1930; the latter’s subtitle testifies to the range and ambition of Byron’s studies and travels by this point: “A History of Colour, Form, and Iconography, illustrated from the Paintings of MISTRA and MOUNT ATHOS, of Giotto and Duccio, and of EL GRECO.” Later travels took Byron&nbsp;to Russia, where he was revolted by Stalin’s police state, and Tibet; to Persia and Afghanistan, which gave him the materials for his masterpiece, <em>The Road to Oxiana</em> (1937), of which Paul Fussell says in <em>Abroad</em> (1980) that it is to travel writing between the wars what <em>The Waste Land</em> is to poetry and <em>Ulysses</em> to the novel. Heirs of empire: Byron’s companion on the road was Christopher Sykes, son of the diplomat Sir Mark Sykes, who negotiated the infamous Sykes-Picot agreement, which secretly divided the Middle East between Britain and France during the First World War. In spite of being a horrible snob, or likely because of it, Byron was one of the few English intellectuals who detested both Stalinism and Nazism without any period of gullibility or forbearance for either. A friend of the future novelist Nancy Mitford, he accompanied her sister Unity—who idolized Hitler—to the last Nuremberg rally in 1938. “These people are so grotesque,” he predicted, “if we go to war it will be like fighting an enormous zoo.” Byron died at thirty-five in 1941, when his troopship was torpedoed by the Germans off Cape Wrath in Scotland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Steven Runciman, who published <em>Byzantine Civilization</em> in 1933, lived long enough to collect all manner of glittering prizes—honorary degrees, bestsellers, a knighthood, and streets named for him in Bulgaria and Greece—during a career industriously pursued until his death in 2000. Not for need. “Riches,” he said in late life, “should be the reward of hard work; preferably, of forebears.” An inheritance from his grandfather, a shipbuilding magnate, freed him to pursue a life of “private” scholarship; as a younger son, he was spared from the family business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A studious child who read French at three, Latin at six, and ancient Greek at seven, Runciman grew into a gilded youth, who wrote to his parents in perfumed green ink, absent-mindedly earned a first in history at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was photographed by his friend Cecil Beaton with a parrot on a ringed finger. In later years he boasted of being “the first, and only, pupil” of the great J. B. Bury, whose writings, beginning with improvements and amplifications of Gibbon’s footnotes and culminating in a two-volume history of his own, helped rehabilitate the Empire in the eyes of modern scholars, now tenured in the once rough-hewn West. Although impressed by the undergraduate’s skills as a linguist, Bury warned him that “Byzantine studies were far too difficult for any innocent youth to undertake.” Undeterred, Runciman wrote a well-reviewed&nbsp; biography of the usurper emperor Romanus Lecapenus which won the attention of Bloomsbury, and, well reviewed, launched him on his long career. On his first trip to Greece in 1924 he was ravished by Monemvasia, the old commercial Byzantine stronghold on the Peloponnesus, counterpart to spectral Mystras, the subject of one of his last books, published almost 70 years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The almost equally long-lived Patrick Leigh Fermor is better known to the general reader, and led a more obviously adventurous life. In December, 1933, aged 18,&nbsp; he set out from Holland to Constantinople (<em>not</em> Istanbul, he specified), traveling on foot, sometimes horseback, at a leisurely pace, enjoying the adventures and gathering the impressions that would take him 40 years to put into print. (“Laziness and timidity,” he explained when pressed to explain the long delay.) As a commando during the Second World War, Leigh Fermor&nbsp;parachuted into Crete, where he spent two and a half years on a mountain-top disguised as a shepherd and, with the local resistance, helped organize the kidnapping of a German general. Like Runciman, Leigh Fermor found his way to Byzantium through the Peloponnesus, where the Empire breathed its last enchantments. After the war, he and his wife Joan designed a house at the remote southern tip of the Peloponnesus, which became a literary destination for literary travelers like the great James Campbell&nbsp;and the setting of his classic book about the region, <em>Mani</em> (1958).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Enabled by their “entitlement” in 20<sup>th </sup>century Britain’s much briefer imperium, the philhellenes advanced an historical enterprise going back to George Finlay, Lord Byron’s comrade in the Greek War of Independence. Long outliving his world-historical friend, Finlay, staying on in Athens, wrote a multi-volume history of Greece between 1843 and 1861 including two books on Byzantium; lightly regarded in his time, they have been respectfully resurrected. The Yugoslav scholar George Ostrogorsky’s classic <em>History of the Byzantine State</em> (1940), addressed to scholars, appeared in English in the mid-1950s, while the English captivated a larger audience with their bright chronicles.&nbsp; By the time Romilly Jenkins was writing the <em>Imperial Centuries</em> in 1966—in the splendor of the Harvard research institute at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., a world center of Byzantine studies—the Empire had gained a new allure and renewed pertinence.</p>

<p>In 1965, reviewing Sir Steven’s <em>The Fall of Constantinople, 1453, </em>Gore Vidal observed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">During the last forty years the attitude of the West toward Byzantium (best expressed by Gibbon) has changed from indifferent contempt to a fascinated admiration for that complex and resourceful society which endured for a thousand years, governed by Roman Emperors in direct political descent from Constantine the Great at the juncture of Europe and Asia into the New Rome. When the Western Empire broke up in the fifth century, Constantinople alone maintained the reality and mystique of the Caesars.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">In 1961 Vidal was at peace with the Kennedys (except for Bobby), having shared a stepfather with Jacqueline Bouvier and supported Jack’s presidential race. In a dispatch to a London newspaper about the new Augustus of the West, he provided a curious detail: “Over the years I’ve occasionally passed books on to him, which I thought would interest him (including such arcana as Byzantine economy).” Really? But if the Cold War was turning out to be “a long twilight struggle,” as JFK later and famously said, surely there might be lessons from the Empire in its 1000-year struggle, which continued even as the Greeks grew ever lonelier and their lives more shadowy.</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">At midnight on the Emperor’s pavement flit<br>
Flames that no faggot feeds, nor steel has lit<br>
No storm disturbs, flame begotten of flame,<br>

Dying into a dance,<br>
An agony of trance,<br>

</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two recent publications about art</strong> and the material world remind me of Thomas Eakins’ <em>Portrait of Dr. Samuel D. Gross</em>, that American masterpiece of a surgery lesson in progress. One is <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/673724/authority-and-freedom-by-jed-perl/""><em>Authority and Freedom: A Defense of the Arts</em></a>, a book by the critic Jed Perl that wants to save its ailing patient Art from demands for social and political relevance. The other is writer Sam Lefebvre’s recently completed research project <a href=""https://www.thelab.org/a-generous-grift-museums-finance-cultural-workers""><em>A Generous Grift</em></a>, which examines the innards of cultural institutions to excise any redemptive allure of the arts from the conscience of those who work and agitate in their orbit. Arriving at a time when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/arts/design/art-auction-value-christies-phillips.html"">inflated auction prices</a> for new works, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jul/17/documenta-15-germany-art-fair-chief-resigns-amid-outrage-over-anti-semitic-works"">thoughtless curation</a> of even newer ones, and renewed <a href=""https://www.artforum.com/print/202101/alex-kitnick-on-the-discontent-with-museums-84657"">institutional</a> <a href=""https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-43/reviews/museum-pessimism/"">critiques</a> make the art world seem no less frayed than the real world, Perl and Lefebvre’s writing ultimately bears directly on an aspect of the discourse that can get lost in the din: the art itself. Like Dr. Gross’s audience, we are left to take notes or look away in horror. Let’s have a glance, at least.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jed Perl previously wrote a two-volume biography of Alexander Calder and 2005’s <em>New Art City,</em> a landmark book on culture in midcentury New York. He was also <em>The New Republic</em>’s art critic for 20 years until its 2014 implosion. There, he once described a Jeff Koons retrospective at the Whitney as a “succession of pop culture trophies so emotionally dead that museumgoers appear a little dazed as they dutifully take out their iPhones and produce their selfies.” Now he says in <em>Authority and Freedom</em> that the deteriorating state of the world has led people more than ever “to ask what the arts can do to help.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">As in <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/106435/barnes-foundation-move-philadelphia-tod-williams-billie-tsien"">much</a> of his criticism, Perl has dressed his iron fist in a velvet glove. Drawing primarily and, occasionally, too heavily, on personal passion, he responds like an elder gently protesting in the very noisy arena where art faces off against everything else. His subject is awfully apropos, his angle is pointed, and yet the book’s slight 176 pages are pleasurable to read.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>For him, the excitement is in how the artist, by creating, strikes a balance between traditional forms (authority) and personal experiment (freedom). It’s this tension, Perl believes, that is special and catalytic and deserves our attention before all else.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">He is clear about his “belief that the arts have their own, independent significance” which importantly sets them apart, on a pedestal even. It brings to mind Ernest Hemingway’s quip to a journalist that “there are no messages in my novels. When I want to send a message, I go to the Post Office.” Perl contends that, while the arts do not shy away from messages, we’ve now started loitering around the mailbox, ignoring the potential of their greater relevance, which lies in the arts’ ability to “move us and excite us unlike anything else in our lives.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For him, the excitement is in how the artist, by creating, strikes a balance between traditional forms (authority) and personal experiment (freedom). It’s this tension, Perl believes, that is special and catalytic and deserves our attention before all else. To flesh this out, he cites a wide range of artists whose work embodies and benefits from this conflict, which depends crucially on craft and creative courage. About authority, Perl quotes the writing of Anni Albers, who, in her words, studied ancient Peruvian textiles “as a way of looking forward from a point way back in time”&nbsp;and found that “limitlessness leads to nothing but formlessness.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About freedom, Perl dedicates a section to Piet Mondrian’s abstract work, which culminated in <em>Victory Boogie Woogie</em>, a painting he was still working on only days before his death in 1944. Through the painting, Perl writes, Mondrian himself came to grapple with the stringency of his famous color block compositions of the 1920s and 1930s, searching for liberation within the fundamentalist approach to painting he’d established.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I saw <em>Victory Boogie Woogie</em> recently at the Kunstmuseum Den Haag, which will not let the painting travel. Small bits of colored tape intermingle with asymmetrical blocks of paint and on the massive canvas, which hangs by itself on a tall white wall, the peeling tape and bleeding lines give you a unique sense of Mondrian’s sustained inventiveness in making the thing. It’s a joyous mess of a painting, unceasingly labored over for more than 2 years, a masterwork at once in progress and decidedly, liberatingly complete.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experimentation underway on the canvas convincingly underlines Perl’s principle that no matter “the artist’s relations with patrons and public, the artist’s primary relationship is with the tools and techniques of the trade.”&nbsp;It’s through that relationship that something is made, the thing we look at, read, watch, or hear, the thing that moves us or falls flat. Perl is adamant that the nature and quality of that relationship should be the primary grounds on which we evaluate art: without it, there would be no creative expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pages Perl spends jumping around the history of arts and letters in decades and centuries no less fraught than ours helps ground his sometimes floaty, philosophical convictions about their persistent value. Perl obviously writes on topics where subjectivity rules and you could say a lot of this book is just, like, his opinion. But as such, I think his writing ultimately affirms art as the domain of nuance and inscrutability, different from political and social questions that can and often should elicit our unequivocal response; in their most common, yet alienating form, those questions are answered in a voting booth. For Perl, the pencil stroke that puts a line on a canvas is far, far away from the one that marks a ballot.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In the unequivocal</strong> and deeply researched text <em>A Generous Grift</em>, published by San Francisco arts space The Lab, Bay Area writer Sam Lefebvre also focuses on relationships: between museums, their employees, their trustees, their big reserves of cash, and their art collections. With the recent wave of organizing at American cultural institutions, Lefebvre is writing to contribute to “a program of solidarity and struggle” for culture workers; “in the best case,” he says, his work “becomes instant litter, trampled by the real movement retaking history in the streets.''</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even for readers who are not museum unionists, <em>Grift</em> is still too well thought out, researched, and written to skip over; but through it all, his main goal to encourage “capacity for analysis and collective action” in culture workers should be kept front of mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lefebvre marshals the references of 55 footnotes and his own hard-boiled interpretation of the institutional art world’s modus operandi to recast museums as “hedge-funds with art”: the growth of their endowments depends on “the stability of financial markets driving ecocide and housing costs,” along with all the other things that financial markets drive. To the extent that they translate into wealthier museums, many of these things also make it harder for museum workers to make ends meet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is an insight that is not very novel, though Lefebvre lays it out again with new names, numbers, and a knack for structure. In 2013, Perl himself <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/115823/record-auction-prices-show-moneys-victory-over-art"">lamented</a> a shady phenomenon that Lefebvre also explores, that of museum directors, through their curatorial activities, boosting valuations for their art collector friends. I remember the collective Occupy Museums’ clunky <a href=""https://whitney.org/exhibitions/2017-biennial?section=41#exhibition-artworks"">inclusion</a> in the Whitney Biennial five years ago addressed similar topics. Yet, the very fact that art institutions like the Whitney have now seemingly accepted these and other critiques spurs Lefebvre on further, all the way to his stark conclusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":1836,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2560px-2017_SFMOMA_from_Yerba_Buena_Gardens.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1836""/><figcaption>San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA), as seen from Yerba Buena Gardens.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In its militancy, all of <em>Grift</em> is compelling, but Lefebvre’s bottom line is striking, all the more so for being plainly logical to his reasoning. Here, Lefebvre contends that “it’s hard to imagine a prohibited form of cultural expression”; and so as art museums embrace progressive values of the day and champion new and underrepresented artists, he says they only implicate a wider swath of artistic creation in their entrenched, financialized overworld. To dismantle it would be to disrupt those inroads, but, in the culmination of his research and reporting, Lefebvre<em> </em>resolves: “What we need is to free ourselves from art.” If you think that the bosses suck but the art is kind of cool, Lefebvre is trying to say that the art is the bosses’ so the art sucks too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Perl is concerned above all else with the materiality of a work of art—everything that went into its making, the labor of the artist, their tools and methods—Lefebvre’s focus is on classic materialist forces that impose themselves on art after its creation, so much so that, from this perspective, a work of art is notable not for its aesthetic properties but its provenance—“the oppression refracted in the circulation of artwork.” That perspective is not invalid and Perl is writing a defense of the artistic act in part because, with every new auction <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-05-09/andy-warhols-shot-sage-blue-marilyn-sets-new-auction-record"">record</a>, our exposure to it is indeed ever more mediated, whether we know it or not, by headlines of astronomical selling prices and <a href=""https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/07/11/is-art-really-booming-reality-lurks-beneath-shiny-numbers"">market trends</a>, just as much as it is mediated by questions of political and social relevance. And so, our experience of the arts edges closer to some combination of news consumption, online shopping, social media scrolling, even voting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Lefebvre does not seem to entertain the idea that there is some value (non-monetary to be sure, and therefore hard to find on a tax filing) in the public display of art in a museum that could countervail the “oppression refracted” in it. This is the surgical crux of Lefebvre’s argument, like slicing out a canvas to better study its gilded frame. If provocative, the stance is refreshing for its simplicity. Meanwhile, Perl’s desire in <em>Authority and Freedom</em> is to hack away at the political and social entanglements we project on artistic expression—you can picture Perl in a gallery scratching off curators’ wall text with a paint scraper. Lefebvre describes a “revenge” of representation at cultural institutions; but where he believes that a disingenuous focus on inclusivity nullifies deeper critiques, Perl worries that it nullifies our ability to appreciate art on its own terms. In response, Lefebvre imagines a toppled museum while Perl hopes for fortification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Thomas Eakins, a deep appreciation for his venerable portrait was also hard won: Its grim and bloody subject offended most of the public who saw it in 1875 and the years after. But as Eakins explored the raw emotional core of realism, he was also painting progress itself. Gross’ clinic was demonstrating new minimally invasive surgery techniques that could save limbs and lives. To progress past their predicaments, Perl and Lefebvre seem bent on amputation.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">With Brazilians facing a vital second round presidential election at month's end, we thought it appropriate to present the following dispatch from Rio de Janeiro. Our correspondent, whose intimacy with the Marvelous City goes back to childhood, offers the following impressions of Rio under Bolsonaro, captured earlier this year during his most recent trip back.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The last time I was in Rio de Janeiro</strong> I found myself at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí taking in the samba-enredos of what cariocas justifiably call “the greatest show on earth.” I watched as the samba schools paraded in a spectacle of the senses—joyous, alive, and oblivious to the pending pandemonium of the virus. Foreigners typically notice the sexual overtones in the performances, missing the politically charged themes and lyrics, like “A Verdade Vós Fará Livre” (“The Truth Will Set You Free”) by the Mangueira school which told the story of Jesus Christ in a contemporary Rio slum. In an open jab at President Jair Messias Bolsonaro, its verses denounced “Messiahs holding guns.” Another school, the União da Ilha do Governador, sang of the unity of mankind before life and mocked “opportunist discourse, greed, and hypocrisy.” Fused to the 4 a.m. beat of a hundred thousand hearts, and downing a healthy dose of vodka Redbulls, I believed that the Brazil I had known as a child lived on. I believed that the election of Bolsonaro had been a regretful, albeit temporary, lapse in judgment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years later, strapped in my seat as the A330 approached Galeão airport, I lusted for a soundtrack. The entertainment system had a paltry selection of Brazilian music. From the album <em>Toquinho Cantando - Pequeno Perfil De Um Cidadão Comum,</em> I clicked play on “Alegoria Das Aves” (“Allegory of the Birds”). Outside my window the morning sun lit the forested mountain peaks and the vast metropolis below. I was coming home to the city of my mother tongue—the city of poetry, of syncopation, of the melancholic smooth tones of Bossa Nova. The 250-ton aluminum bird touched down to “Entre a Loucura E A Razão” (“Between Madness and Reason”).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ordered a fried egg breakfast at an understaffed hotel in Copacabana and eavesdropped on a family behind me. The fleshy matriarch pulled out a blister pack of pills while her young daughter scooped up a sugary pudding. A despondent-looking husband and the child’s impassive grandmother looked on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Does anyone want some?” the mother said, as she pressed a pill into her own hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It puts me in a good mood. Don’t you want to be in a good mood?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She washed the pill down with a watered-down orange extract.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pan-pan. Bromazepam. Clonazepam. Some form or other of <em>pam</em>. Once upon a time, this kind of medication was a stigma, but Brazil has risen to become the largest consumer of clonazepam—which is used to treat anxiety, panic disorders, and seizures—in the world. The 80% spike in sales during the pandemic came atop a long-term trend. Brazil is now the world leader when it comes to anxiety disorders. Whether this is a consequence of addiction, politics, or the constant fear of violence is up for debate. Likely, it’s a blend of all three. But pills eliminate neither crime nor hunger.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Outside the hotel, skeletal figures roamed the streets. Mothers slept with their children on the sidewalk under fig trees decorated with orchids. At the tourist stomping grounds along the Copacabana and Ipanema beaches there was no peace—every minute a beggar passed through disguised as a seller. Children begged for a bite to eat outside of the <em>butecos</em>. Inside, people downed savory <em>petiscos</em> with copious amounts of beer, and, as their waist measurements testified, in ever greater quantities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my room I turned on the news. I was taken aback when a reporter pointed to a chart and declared with pride that for the first time in twenty years the Republic had exported more commodities than anything else combined—51% to be precise. From an industrialized nation to a commodity provider, so much for order and progress. The pandemic was coming to an end, but I felt as if I had returned to Rio in a broken time machine, and the past I had landed in was a dreamlike parody. I was no longer sure I could trust my senses or my memory. The country seemed corrupted by a latent sadomasochistic impulse.</p>

<p><strong>I spent </strong>the days bolting across upper- and middle-class<em> bairros</em> in worn down Ubers. The cars’ tires seemed ready to peel off and, for lack of a seat belt, I held on to the handles above the window. Everywhere I saw a potential fanatic Bolsonarist waiting to enter into a shouting contest, waiting to boil over and finally put their shooting range experience into practice. I stayed quiet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uber was the cheapest way to get around. Back in 1994 the Brazilian Real used to be even with the dollar. In 2011 it was 2:1. Now I could buy five Brazilian republics for the price of one American president. Five empires for a horse. Inflation was a problem in the 90s, but this newer trend was a reflection of capital flight—a loss of hope. Built in the 1950s, Brazil’s capital, Brasilia, had been modeled on an aircraft taking off. Rapid industrialization suggested imminent prosperity, but the coup in 1964 put a stop to that. The 2000s seemed to rival that sentiment of boundless hope. In 2009 the <em>Economist</em> famously announced “Brazil takes off.” If so, it flew directly into the impeachment of Dilma Rouseff seven years later. “Brazil is not a serious country,” De Gaulle is reported to have said, but it is unclear whether it was De Gaulle or the Brazilian ambassador he was meeting with who uttered these words. Faced with so many aborted takeoffs, Brazilians have perpetuated the myth in regular outbreaks of self-doubt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The threat of hurtling out of an Uber window at 100km/h was palpable, but widespread crime brought the reptile brain to life. As comfortable as a soft linen dress shirt and a pair of dapper sunglasses may have been, style makes you stand out in a country where class markers are best saved for the inside of a private chopper. To survive in the Marvelous City you have to do as the cariocas do: don’t stand out, and don’t trust anyone. Sometimes even that isn’t enough. Late at night in a bar in <em>Barra da Tijuca</em>, a safe area close to the beach in an upper middle-class neighborhood, I was having a drink with a lawyer when he pointed out a man in a blue hoodie with thick leather gloves. The man seemed to be waiting for something. Only one type of person wears a hoodie and gloves in the tropical summer. The house<em> </em>where I had lived as a child was within walking distance. So too the constructivist school where I first learned the alphabet. As I imagined what it would be like to be hit by a stray bullet, we moved to the bar next door. The lawyer left to inform the police. When the cops arrived, the blue hooded man was gone.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong> that museums might provide some comfort, I made my way to the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by the Valencian starchitect, Santiago Calatrava. Opened in 2016 in anticipation of the Rio Olympic Games, the hopeful edifice looks like a gigantic futuristic liferaft, sited north-south on an old pier at the edge of Guanabara Bay. There was a distinct lack of vegetation and the heat was infernal. The surrounding turquoise pools were filled with rust from the iron ore that blows from the shipyard across the bay. In early 2022, the theme of the main temporary exhibit was “Amazonian Futures.” Despite standing meters from a ticket booth, the only way to buy a ticket was through my smartphone. The website did not accept my foreign card. On a five-meter placard the logos of the exhibition’s main sponsors glared white on denim blue. Apparently Shell and Bayer were proud defenders of the future of the Amazon. I turned on my heel and trekked away across the hellish heat.</p>

<p>Soon I found myself in a stately refuge. <em>MAM</em>, the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art, a 1950s modernist concrete structure designed by Brazilian Affonso Eduardo Reidy, remained a temple to the hopes of that era. Here was a markedly different symbolism from that of the Museum of Tomorrow. A lush garden rested behind the majestic structure: a small oasis open to all in the feverish city heat.</p>

<p class=""indented"">There were more shelters to be found. In central Rio, old areas had welcomed new patrons. At <em>Bafo da Prainha</em>, old Brazil met a progressive mindset. In shorts and t-shirts, people of every forward-thinking persuasion gathered around flabby wooden tables, foldable chairs, and sunburned plastic stools. Women with colorful hair made out as a man in his thirties sold pins stamped with anti-fascist themes and anti-Bolsonaro dreams: In the upcoming election, they would certainly vote for the return of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Around this crowd stood the façades of eclectically restored buildings from the turn of the 19th century. I only visited Bafo da Prainha once, and my night was cut short by a torrential rain that scattered the crowds and inundated many of the roads leading out.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some days later I found another sanctuary nearby. Halfway to the top of <em>Santo Cristo</em>, an old hilltop neighborhood in the port region, was <em>Bar do Omar</em>. Renovated by a business savvy anti-Bolsonarist who made a point of selling beer called “Lula Livre,” the bar had a spectacular view of the city. On the way up the Uber driver thought he had entered a <em>favela</em>, by reputation and the connotative steep incline. Aesthetically it was not far from that of hilltop neighborhoods in Lisbon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By then the Hunga Tonga eruption had made its way to Brazil. A dramatic tropical sunset turned purple indigo and Russian violet. Inside the bar, a spray-painted mural showed the former president Lula with a beard of flowers. Among the brimming life sat known local politicians of the broader left. Every once in a while, someone stopped to take a selfie. The speakers blasted leftist oldies louder and louder as the night progressed. After the bar closed, a dozen Uber drivers canceled upon seeing the pickup point. We had to reassure them that it was safe.</p>

<p><strong>As</strong> the omicron variant began to threaten daily life in Rio, I packed my bags. On the way to the airport, we passed a car that had burst into flames on the other side of the highway. Close to the terminal, traffic slowed. A group of military police holding automatic rifles signaled every car to slow down. The rifled cop raised his barrel straight at the driver’s isofilm covered window ahead of us. The cop took a step back. The windows rolled down. His squad peeked in and let the car pass. Our turn. Our lights came on and the windows buzzed down. The bullet path crossed each one of us as they scanned our faces and finally let us through.</p>

<p>As a child, I had a neighbor who was murdered. He had a mansion on our street. Whether it was his or his lover’s, no one can agree, even after all these years. But he was killed—gunned down on his motorcycle on the way to his girlfriend’s. His nickname was Maninho and he was a criminal. His brother, Bid, was killed in 2020 in a similar trap. Now, on my way out of the country, I heard that Interpol had arrested the brainchild of Bid’s assassination in Colombia. I wondered if anyone had ever caught Maninho’s killer. As I stood in the check-in line, two detectives in short sleeved shirts and jeans, badges firmly hanging from their necks, approached the serpentine formation. One of them held some papers. I looked back at them as they scanned everyone in the line. Like a child I toyed with the idea that they were after me—a superspy on the run. They remained for a while, and then left.</p>

<p>The plane took off and a heavy rain commenced. From a window seat I watched the wind roar against the wing. Lightning flashed every other second in the distance. Ten thousand feet, twenty thousand, thirty thousand and we were still sailing through an anchor gray sky, the wingtips only visible in flashes. The plane veered west, away from the Atlantic and further into the country. At thirty-five thousand feet, still nothing but a choppy ride and darkness. To think that the sky could hold so much water at such altitude. Kilometers of water ready to plummet towards the ground. I imagined the deluge ahead. After a couple of hours, we turned east again and as soon as we passed the bay where Cabral first made landfall, the sky cleared and the seatbelt signs went dark. I shut my eyes and slept. I do not remember my dream. It was all quiet. Three weeks later Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>WHAT’S IN A COLUMN?</strong> Free associations? Anachronisms? The communication of an idea? Ideals? In “The Cat Inside,” a short short by Bill Burroughs published in the fall 1992 issue of the <em>Paris Review</em>, someone objects to someone else’s fondness for Hollywood’s pervasive sentimental wholesomeness by declaring, “I’ll tell you what’s wrong with it B.J., it’s shit. It’s dead mawkish muck and it destroys the truth under it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the next paragraph, we read a simple scenario of a mother seal and a cub whose shoulder has been torn to shit, probably by some adult male, awaiting a fateful crossing. “Probably won’t make it. They all have to swim to Denmark. 1500 miles away. Why? These seals don’t know why. They have to get to Denmark.” The truth here is palpable and yet invisible, like a stench or an impulse. In this manner, we don’t ask what’s in a column or why. We just get to Denmark. Or South Dakota. Or whatever symbol you maintain to draw you in with inexorable oneness of purpose. Try to dodge the mawkish muck—the earnest and the paranoid, American archetypes both—and get to a source of vitality. To hell with introductions.</p>

<p><strong>I intended to write about Jean-Luc Godard</strong>. He died on September 19th. The legendary cineaste was the last of the French New Wave (or <em>nouvelle vague</em>) founding fathers to punch the clock, following François Truffaut, d. 1984, Claude Chabrol, d. 2010, Éric Rohmer, d. 2010, and Jacques Rivette, d. 2016. His demise took me back to my early 20s when being cool was all that mattered and being cool meant Jean-Luc Godard, meant dressing modish and behaving coquettish and being out of step with times that felt suspiciously facile and stylistically unremarkable. Accompanying those memories came the wisdom that 1) I wasn’t the only one who had felt this way, regardless of how I felt at the time (and that universality of unique experience is one of the functions of great art), and 2) those days are irrevocably dead, just like Jean-Luc, just like my youth, and just like the naïveté that with the Great Recession in the rearview, things would only get better.</p>

<p class=""indented"">For a brief period in the 1960s, Jean-Luc Godard <em>was</em> style. His provocative blend of quasi-philosophical pronouncements (“I don’t know if I’m unhappy because I’m not free, or if I’m not free because I’m unhappy,” “The more one talks the less words mean”) and socio-political commentary dressed in vibrant formal innovations worked doubly well on the youth. It’s a formula that has continued well into this century. It’s also the sexiest the Left (radical or otherwise) would ever look.</p>

<p class=""indented"">While I would go on to distance myself from Godard's particular brand of New Wave cool—as we often distance ourselves from previous iterations of ourselves, ever amalgamating toward some newer, ever-wanting and misshapen whole—I remained haunted by snippets of dialog, stray images, color combinations. Subconsciously, my sense of ""cool"" and ""style"" had absorbed swatches of <em>nouvelle vague</em>’s philosophical bravado, nonchalance toward tragedy, allusion through dress, and a bacchanal of art. ""All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl,"" through dark sunglasses. Isn't it pretty to think so?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I could try to go on about the bold triumphs of <em>Breathless</em>, <em>A Woman Is a Woman</em>, <em>My Life to Live</em>, <em>Contempt</em>, <em>Band of Outsiders</em>, <em>Pierrot le Fou</em>, etc., and their formal impacts on filmmakers ranging from Paul Schrader to Spike Lee to Quentin Tarantino to Mary Harron to Wes Anderson, etc., etc. I could attempt to discuss the boundaries broken by his filmic essays on radical politics starting with <em>Two or Three Things I Know About Her</em>, on through the Dziga Vertov Group pictures like <em>Sympathy for the Devil</em>, <em>Everything’s Going Fine</em>, and <em>Letter to Jane</em>. I could take a half-assed crack at his finding himself in narrative film once again, through 1980’s heavy <em>Every Man for Himself</em>, his revisionist approach to <em>King Lear</em> (starring Norman Mailer, Burgess Meredith, and Molly Ringwald), his experimentation in <em>Keep Your Right Up</em>. (I can’t say anything of note about anything that came after because I haven’t seen any of it, though I know I should.) But I don’t really want to. I’m preoccupied with something else.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Notably, Jean-Luc Godard went out on top. He lived a long life, one which was monstrously prolific and hardly (if ever) beholden to the wants of any other. Then, ever the master of his fate and reminiscent of someone staring into a vast and empty sea like Fritz Lang playing Fritz Lang at the end of <em>Contempt</em>, Godard gave his final direction: He yelled cut on the long drama of his own life. No, Godard’s tale isn’t one of much horror or real tragedy. Sure, his relationships might not all have worked out (Anna Karina famously noted “He was very strange… He drove me a bit crazy”), but everyone came out alright in the end. His life is a masterpiece of art and commerce and cultural impact and one of the most impressive—and complete—bodies of artistic fulfillment on record.</p>

<p class=""indented"">But it’s October, after all, and even amid the episodic heatwave that besieges us down here in unglamorous L.A. (for true glamor is never this oblivious to reality), the leaves are beginning to fall, and pumpkins are showing up in weird and awkward places. And Criterion, the “Channel that Godard built,” has ushered in a whole new wave of frights for this, the Spooky Season, a time I am neither enraptured by nor impervious to.</p>

<p class=""indented"">And so the Giovanni Pintori-esque elegance of J-L G’s <em>Two or Three Things…</em> must be replaced by the lushness of the Douglas Sirk melodrama meets Gallo-inspired B-horror in 2016’s <em>The Love Witch</em>. Then, Nicolas Cage eats a cockroach and stalks the streets of Lower Manhattan sporting fake vampire teeth in 1989’s <em>Vampire’s Kiss</em>. But while now is horror's hour, horror is <em>always</em> around, lurking in plain sight—or else stalking someone’s life. Just ask Marilyn Monroe.</p>

<p><strong>It's April 1945. Hitler is dead in Berlin</strong>, his blood still warm in his body, and an American woman is posing for a photo in his bathtub in Munich. Her name is Lee Miller. She's bathing. A picture of the Führer, propped on the bath rim, observes her naked body. On the basin to her left there's a statuette, maybe of Venus. It’s quiet, but the whole scene feels like gossip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So begins the postwar period. Or, so it began in <em>Postwar Modern: New Art in Britain 1945-1965,</em> which ran from March to June, 2022, at the Barbican Centre in London. The photo of Miller, taken by David Scherman, was the opening piece, and it might have shocked anyone who takes their shoes off inside: Miller wore her dirty boots all the way to the tub and wiped them on the Führer's mat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'd never imagined Hitler taking a bath, but it must be true: even mass murderers sweat. It's possible Jesus perspired, too, but that's not something I could see in Francis Newton Souza's rendering of the Crucifixion in the next room. In ""The Agony of Christ,"" which Souza painted in 1958, Jesus is Black, figurative, and not very happy: He's got blood in his eyes and seems to <em>be</em> the cross. The wall text wondered if this Savior was Souza:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">This agonized, confrontational Jesus seems to embody what cultural theorist Stuart Hall observed was common to artists who came to Britain having lived under colonial rule: the desire to ‘look [Britain] in the eye, and, if possible, conquer it.’</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Souza was born in Portuguese Goa and worked in British Bombay before moving to London in 1949. His life and work show that “postwar,” in Britain, is also postimperial: Look Black Jesus in the eye and you might see the end of the British Empire. That “end” was, of course, only the beginning of something new, as in Eva Frankfurther’s painting “West Indian Waitresses” (1955), where Caribbean migrants are ladling out food in a Piccadilly cafeteria.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Newness, in feeling more than form, was central to this show. Photos by Bert Hardy captured new ways of having fun, as in, Let’s hang out on the bomb site. In “Betty Burden plays with a young boy on a bomb site in Birmingham,” Betty, a teenager, helps a boy move his bike up a smashed urban slope. In the background there are houses and ruins, and the photo seems to memorialize a moment before bliss: in a few seconds, the boy will rush into the ruins below.</p>

<p>In a show so indebted to war, it was hard not to think about Ukraine, but gloppy paintings by John Bratby made it easier. His 1954 still life of a table heaving with food, painted the same year rationing ended in Britain, felt like an exercise in excess. Also, he beat his wife, the painter Jean Cooke, and to illustrate her abuse the curators, in a sublime act of revisionist retribution, put her “Mad Self Portrait” (1954) opposite his paintings. In it, Cooke has a healthy black eye.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“War,” said Randolph Bourne, “is the health of the state.” It is also the patron of modern art. Dada does not exist without the First World War. Surrealism does not exist without Dada. And the art in <em>Postwar Modern,</em> from the detached lovers in Lucian Freud’s autobiographical “Hotel Bedroom” (1954) to the roiling abstraction of Magda Cordell’s “Figure 59” (1958), sucks every teat of the war machine. For Freud and Cordell, this machine made ruins, and it’s the experience of living, and loving, in ruins—psychological ruins; physical ruins—that feeds the figures in their work. The most striking pieces in the show turned these ruins into something human.</p>

<p>That is, if you can call Eduardo Paolozzi's bronze sculptures <em>human.</em> Arranged in a room aptly named “Strange Universe” (a term borrowed from Franciszka Themerson), these gaunt, armless entities—“St. Sebastian III” (1958), “The Philosopher” (1957), and “St. Sebastian IV” (1957)—looked like the love childs of golems and robots, their bodies seemingly carved from ancient rocks of spinning wheels, looms, clocks, bent forks, toys, the keys of a piano, and the innards of engines, among other mechanical gubbins.</p>

<p>There’s no such thing as postwar. War is the mother of the modern state, and even when she buggers off, maybe to take a bath or ride a bike, she’s always around, haunting the present like an after-hours ghost. That’s what I saw in Paolozzi’s bronze beings (“gods,” he called them). At first glance, each body was an assemblage of broken objects that he collected from bomb sites in London. “But this detritus,” writes Ben Highmore,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">was physically lost in the process of fabrication. Fabricated by the lost-wax method (an ancient technique of bronze casting where the wax mold is destroyed in the act of casting), the sculptures articulate the details of the gleaned items in their absence. The figures were made by producing wax sheets that bore the imprint of bomb-site junk.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""> All that remained of the bent forks and machine parts – the bodies of these bombsite beings – were the impressions, or copies, of their ruin. The “ghosts,” said Paolozzi, “of forms.” That’s the modern body, too: an impression of something old, found, and maybe human.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Unless, of course, you were a woman in Bill Brandt’s photos. Then the modern (female) body was naked, overexposed, and probably indifferent to men, especially Brandt, whom the catalog assured was “delighted” with his “‘new eye on the world’” after experimenting with a wide-angle “peephole-type lens” that intensified and dramatized his subjects, especially their breasts.</p>

<p>In a different kind of drama, I watched a video performance by Gustav Metzger. “Anti-capitalist, anti-materialist, anti-nuclear,” he was throwing acid on a fabric screen somewhere on London’s South Bank. Each splash of acid made a new hole on the screen. Each new hole revealed the survivors on the other side: St. Pauls, the Thames, and so on.</p>

<p>It was now 1965. Twenty years had passed since I arrived at <em>Postwar Modern: New Art in Britain</em>, and while Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning were evangelizing abstract expressionism on the other side of the Atlantic, transforming the canvas into what Harold Rosenberg called an “arena,” Britain’s artists had been holding their own arena in their hands—their cities, or what was left of them—and transforming them into strange, raw visions for the future. On my way out of the gallery, I saw two Hockneys where the <em>post</em>postwar was condomed, queer, and America’s to lose.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>A film star is not bound </strong>by the rules of time and space. Her true currency—imagery—affords her a shot at bliss, a privilege ever stalked by horror. In death, the film star coaxes out cinema’s more necrophiliac tendencies: Persons long dead animate screens agelessly, over and over again, free to besiege our dreams, to instigate lovers’-like spats, crimes of passion. “A film star is not a character in a book,” wrote Elizabeth Hardwick. She is “not a writer with [her] text to be thought about, not a personage in history fixed by the glue of biography.” A film star is something altogether different: bewitching, preternatural.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Marilyn Monroe may just be the ghost queen of film stars. Certainly in Los Angeles, her town, where her spirit supposedly dwells part-time at the Hotel Roosevelt, keeping watch over the street impersonators of Hollywood Boulevard and the stars of the Chinese Theater alike. Her dystopian tale is very City of Angels. Born at L.A. County General, she was shipped off to the outer reaches of Hawthorne, seduced by Hollywood and chewed up and spit out. But she never died, not really. A touch of the uncanny can be felt from her many murals and street portraits. And following the many gruesome testimonies of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal, the grim tale of her fate at the hands of powerful men has been given more era-appropriate, gore-core resonance.</p>

<p>Australian filmmaker Andrew Dominik’s latest film, his first dramatic effort in 10 years, is a hyper-stylized, hallucinatory adaptation of <em>Blonde</em>, Joyce Carol Oates’s unsparingly hellish 2000 novel about Monroe. Starring Ana de Armas as the most iconic female of the modern era, <em>Blonde</em> (available on Netflix) has since been called “One of the Most Detestable Movies Ever Made.” Oates hailed it “a work of art” and called Dominik’s vision “identical to my own” in a recent <em>New Yorker</em> profile. Despite Dominik’s attempts to combat our climate of outrage<em>—</em>“[<em>Blonde </em>is] a film that definitely has a morality about it. But it swims in very ambiguous waters… There’s something in it to offend everyone”—its issues lie elsewhere.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">It’s been a while since something Marilyn-related was <em>this</em> hated. Commissioned by Lawrence Schiller in 1973 to write a 30,000 word introduction for a handsome paycheck, Feminist Enemy No.1 Norman Mailer buffet-trayed himself to 93,000 words for the picture biography, <em>Marilyn: The Classic</em>. People were not impressed. (Pauline Kael wrote in the <em>New York Times</em>: “Who knows what to think about Marilyn Monroe or those who turn her sickness into metaphor? I wish they’d let her die.” In <em>Commentary</em>, Clive James called Mailer’s adoration “as amateurish as an autograph hunter’s.”)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Nevertheless, even Mailer (who had an intense attraction to the screen icon and even tried to force a meeting between the two to no avail) aptly criticized the state of Monroe’s place in the wider media: “We have only seen her limned as an angelic and sensitive victim or a murderous emotional cripple.” In his own belligerent, 10,000-words-a-minute manner, Mailer searches—yearns—for Marilyn’s will, for her agency, for her “desperate imperative” (not of the desperate female varietal but of the wounded psyche’s desperation to communicate). Sex-obsessed as ever, however, he hammily dubs her the “angel of sex” and, apart from his characteristically keen eye for scene and detail, much of the book is a continuation of his Reichian-tinged commentaries on American culture—Marilyn Monroe as a superlative, sexual entity, eliciting, rebuffing, desiring, and bleeding sexual energy all the way to the grave.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Skeptical of the biographical form’s ability to effectively capture anyone’s life—let alone Monroe’s—Mailer declared the following challenge: “It is possible there is no instrument more ready to capture the elusive quality of her nature than a novel.” Message received by Joyce Carol Oates, in a remarkable, even Balzacian effort, considered both “fat, messy, and fierce” (<em>New York Times</em>) and “a bloated, humorless fictional speculation” (<em>Kirkus</em>). She was drawn to Norma Jeane Baker as “the girl in a fairy tale” and used that starting point to construct something in the mold of a feminist’s Great American Novel. Most of all, Oates claimed to be most interested in writing about life in America, in all its facets. Which brings us back to Dominik’s latest take.</p>

<p><em><strong>Blonde</strong></em><strong> largely plays</strong> as a long-winded composite of gorgeous shots and masterly tricks of light and effect. Aspect ratios switch, black and white alternates with color, and there is no doubt that as a dreamy “art piece” <em>Blonde</em> works. (But let’s leave the CGI baby out of it. Maybe calling out to Kubrick’s Star Child was an allusion too far.) Where <em>Blonde </em>fails, however, is that Marilyn is thrown from shimmering scene to shimmering scene, from humiliation and heartbreak to heartbreak and humiliation, like a pinball. Despite being anchored by Ana de Armas’s deeply felt performance, the story, ostensibly known by just about <em>everyone</em>, is left to follow an automated track, feeling vacant, like one of those amusement park rides where the little train cars negotiate a house of animatronic horrors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, the furrowed brows and scowls of Bobby Cannavale as concerned sexist Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio are skillfully rendered, as are Adrien Brody’s pensive, mournful looks as Egghead Arthur Miller the cowardly. But they lack dimensionality, as do practically all the historical figures. So set in their historical stone, these roles aren’t even granted the illusion that their lives constituted difficult choices. They’re all just grave markers in a long and neo-gothic fairy tale. Or maybe Dominik indeed set out to shoot a most spectacular and fatalistic example of historical determinism. Either way, something isn’t working.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Let’s be clear. Touching Marilyn Monroe from any seemingly inventive biographical perspective seems to be verboten. If there’s anything I’ve learned from the responses to <em>Blonde </em>(Dominik), <em>Blonde </em>(Oates), and <em>Marilyn</em> (Mailer), it’s that no one is happy with anyone else’s take on someone that has burned canyons into the synapses of their personal gray matter, no matter the author’s intentions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where Dominik’s <em>Blonde</em> works is as pure horror. It’s horrific, but not abhorrent, on three distinct levels: aesthetically, as a nightmare fever dream; psychologically, as an emotionally taxing course on unrelenting sexual and mental abuse (climaxing in a devastating JFK depiction—featuring staff lingering, Bobby listening, Jackie fucking weeping—as a king rotten with power); but worst of all, artistically, for it introduces the horror that despite the hook of a true icon, one with whom millions of people sympathize, we suddenly find ourselves bored, disconnected from the horrors taking place, for Marilyn herself has become a mannequin on rails—and what greater horror is there than boredom with tragedy?</p>

From the backyard of their relationship, which is where I sat as daughter and daughter-in-law, I couldn’t help but wonder: What now? No doubt I’d be asked to find Claude a new husband. This happened when dad left George, and then Sander. I found someone for George, and Sander died, thank God. But Claude. Claude was something else. He slept in his shoes. He ran to work. He read minds. But there were perks, certainly. He yelled in the airport, which moved things along. He read poetry. He smoked American Spirits in the morning.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Czesław Miłosz: A California Life<br>

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">America. What splendor! What poverty! What humanity! What inhumanity! What mutual goodwill! What individual isolation! What loyalty to the ideal! What hypocrisy! What a triumph of conscience! What perversity!<br>
—Miłosz’s ABCs</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>“THE NATURE</strong> <strong>OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST,</strong>” wrote Czesław Miłosz, the Lithuanian-born Polish-American poet, essayist, and novelist, “...is somewhat demoniac. In its immensity, in its landscapes of parched, cracked soil, of forests whose trees remind one of granite columns, there is something which seems to mock at and to annihilate our fragile humanity.” It’s a vivid observation, one in which our sensitivity becomes a liability. Miłosz, an exile of profound proportions, believed the American psyche was formed of an obsessive-compulsive reaction to the nature of the continent. By the time the pioneers reached California, the perceived liberties and mysteries of the vast wilderness had transformed their wonder into conquest, their fear into greed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Czesław Miłosz, the 1980 Nobel Laureate, moved to California in 1960. “I came here to endure, but not to like it,” he recalled almost 30 years later. Invited for what he figured was a temporary academic post at UC Berkeley, Miłosz could have only been certain of one thing: He couldn’t go home—behind the Iron Curtain—again. In Cynthia Haven’s latest book, <em><a href=""https://www.heydaybooks.com/catalog/czeslaw-milosz-a-california-life/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Czesław Miłosz: A California Life</a>, </em>the Polish master’s fertile yet uneasy Berkeley period is surveyed as one man’s battle to translate struggle into wisdom, despair into perseverance. From a modest cottage at 978 Grizzly Peak Boulevard overlooking the San Francisco Bay, Miłosz would produce some of the greatest works of his storied career, helping to give expression to the tumult of pain and beauty that characterized the most explosive century in human history. For, as Seamus Heaney stated, Miłosz had a gift “for going straight to the heart of a question… He is among those members of humankind who have had the ambiguous privilege of knowing and standing far more reality than the rest of us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Czesław Miłosz</strong> <strong>was born</strong> in what is now Lithuania on June 30, 1911, in the village of Šeteniai (Szetejnie). His father, Alexander Miłosz, was a Polish civil engineer whose ancestral line can be traced as far back as 1580. (Oscar Miłosz, the celebrated Lithuanian poet, was a distant cousin.) His mother Weronika, née Kunat, may, as legend tells it, have descended from a “Lithuanian chieftain whose tribe was eradicated during the Middle Ages by the Poles and the Teutonic Knights.” The Lithuanians, the last of Europe’s pagan cultures to be subdued by Christian savagery, were, according to Miłosz, the “Indians of Europe,” and their customs and plight remained buried deep within him. His childhood in rural Šeteniai lacked any of the trappings of the upper class, despite his ostensibly noble heritage. He romped among grassy rolling fields and dark woods, internalizing the natural order that would anchor his worldview.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outbreak of the First World War in 1914, however, ruptured this bucolic bliss. His father was conscripted to the Russian army and, as the war progressed, the family was drawn further eastward. As he tells it in his 1959 autobiography, <em>Native Realm</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Talk about hunger never ceased. One could get bread that contained more sawdust than flour, saccharin and potatoes, but no sugar or meat. At night I would be awakened by battering at the door, stamping of feet and loud voices. Men in leather jackets and high boots would come in and, by the light of a smoking kerosene lamp, dump the contents of cupboards and drawers onto the floor… The terror-stricken faces of the women, my brother’s screams from his cradle, the whole miserable family sanctuary, or rather den, turned topsy-turvy—all this was not healthy for the heart of a child.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following his father’s involvement in a failed attempt to incorporate independent Lithuania into the Second Polish Republic, the Miłoszs were exiled to Vilnius (Wilno)—then part of Poland. He remained there until the summer of 1937, when at 26, he moved to Warsaw. Again, from <em>Native Realm</em>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">When I reached adolescence, I carried inside me a museum of mobile and grimacing images: blood-smeared Seryozha, a sailor with a dagger, commissars in leather jackets, Lena, a German sergeant directing an orchestra, Lithuanian riflemen from paramilitary units, and these were mingled with a throng of peasants—smugglers and hunters, Mary Pickford, Alaskan fur trappers and my drawing instructor. Modern civilization, it is said, creates uniform boredom and destroys individuality. If so, then this is one sickness I had been spared.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miłosz was in Warsaw when the Nazis invaded in September 1939. Along with colleagues from his post at Polish Radio, he escaped to Lviv (Lwów) without his wife, Janina. They were reunited when he returned in the summer of 1940 (and remained mostly together until her death in 1986). He participated in the underground. He aided the city’s Jews. He prepared an anthology of wartime poetry. Hypnotized by <em>The Waste Land</em> while bombs illuminated the night sky and the city around him was methodically razed, he translated T.S. Eliot’s <em>Collected Poems, 1909-1935</em>. “My generation was lost. Cities too. And nations,” he wrote in his poem, “Diary of a Naturalist.” In “Tiger,” his essay on Polish writer Bolesław Miciński, he expanded: “I was not born into a class that knew how to prize [money] and I had walked out of too many burning cities (literally and metaphorically) without looking back… Soft carpets, gadgets, neat little houses I associated with flames and destruction.” Then in 1944, a mysterious stranger appeared. As Haven describes it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Miłosz was caught by the Germans and put in a makeshift camp. A majestic
nun appeared that evening, insisting he was her nephew. For an hour she spoke fluent German with his captors, and then led him away through the main gates. He had never seen her before, and he never saw her after that day. He never knew her name.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just after the war, Miłosz moved first to New York City and then to Washington D.C. as cultural attaché for the freshly formed People’s Republic of Poland. Ostensibly responsible for Polish cultural occasions such as concerts, art exhibitions, and literary and cinematic events, he began writing a series of essays on American writers for Polish readers. “What really preoccupied me,” he admits in “Tiger,” “were studies on Eliot and Auden, anthologies of American poetry, the world of Faulkner and Henry Miller, the poetry of Robert Lowell and Karl Shapiro, periodicals such as <em>Partisan Review</em> or Dwight Macdonald’s <em>Politics</em>, and exhibits of modern art.” His first American period set the stage for the polarities of American art and American culture to percolate within him, bouncing off his own tensions between hunger and guilt, sin and redemption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1949, Miłosz returned to Poland for the first time in four years. He was appalled by what he witnessed. His experiences formed the basis of his landmark book, <em>The Captive Mind</em> (1953), a vivid look at how totalitarian regimes poison the intellectual and cultural well of nations, told through four profiles of promising writers he had known who conformed to Stalinist doublethink. “Peasants go mad with despair,” Miłosz wrote to a fellow exile, “and in the intellectual world state control is deeply entrenched and it is necessary to be a 100% Stalinist, or not at all.”</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In 1950, Miłosz was summoned back to Warsaw. Soon fearing for his own safety, (“He is deeply detached from us,” Polish Writers’ Union General Secretary Jerzy Putrament wrote to his superiors in July 1950), Miłosz fled to Paris, aided by staff at Polish émigré publication, <em>Kultura.</em> On February 1, 1951, he formally defected. His French years, though isolating—he lived in poverty while his wife and young child remained in the U.S.—were productive. In addition to <em>The Captive Mind,</em> he published two poetry collections, two novels—in 1955 alone—and many more essays and reflections. His numerous appeals for American visas were denied during the McCarthy years; in America <em>The Captive Mind </em>had the ironic effect of painting him as a Soviet spy, or at the very least a Stalinist apologist. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In the spring of 1959, however, with the Red Scare finally over and his reputation enhanced by the decade’s work, Czesław Miłosz was offered a position as visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley. Enchanted by his “Romantic vision of America” as <em>natura</em>, the term he used for the comparatively stable natural world running alongside the frenzy of human affairs, he imagined for a moment his post would bring him tranquility and room for contemplation. But, as Haven puts it, “Berkeley was about to become a lightning rod for <em>devenir</em>, the world of change and becoming, and he would be in the thick of it.”</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong>“Being high on a mountain</strong>,” </strong>Miłosz’s former student Mark Klus observed, “gave him a certain viewpoint that fostered an apocalyptic outlook.” Miłosz desired and needed an atmosphere conducive to observation and contemplation. From his crow’s nest in Berkeley, exile among exiles, he witnessed the growing pains of a culture barrelling toward another major turning point in modern history. The Baby Boomers, improvident children of victory over the Axis of evil and the ensuing years of unprecedented prosperity, were coming of age in an electric and eclectic way. But periods of great unrest often follow periods of great prosperity. Between 1964 and 1971, the Bay Area saw the Auto Row Protests, the Free Speech Movement, the Third World Liberation Front strikes, the “Battle for People’s Park,” and the Occupation of Alcatraz. “Berkeley in the [Sixties] was heady with the scent of night jasmine and tear gas,” publisher Steve Wasserman wrote, “[it] was rife with rebellion.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I do not wish to play games with chains of causes and effects,” Miłosz wrote in “Facing An Expanse Too Large,” “and so will simply acknowledge that this continent possesses something like a spirit which malevolently undoes any attempt to subdue it.” His 1969 collection, <em>Visions from San Francisco Bay</em>, is the closest Miłosz would come to a blow-by-blow document of a nation in flux from the point of view of the last stop in America, the San Francisco Bay, that mesmerizing bookend to the deceptive embrace of New York Harbor. A vivid batch of essays, <em>Visions</em> contemplates the labyrinth of mirrors guiding the troubled rise of modern, rational man.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miłosz struggled to articulate a humanistic interpretation of American society. In “The Agony of the West,” he tried to uncover why eras of great technological progress seemed ever-accompanied by cries of “decadence and rotting” from its artists and thinkers. “The myth of decline and decay has to be contagious. I say myth because there is obviously a certain unity of aura and tone stronger than truth or untruth at work here.” From where exactly had the West fallen? Which ideal state of equilibrium and vigor? Nowhere anyone can agree on; anyplace, anytime it seemed, but now. And the “now” of this provocative—and proactively opaque—myth goes back centuries. The deeper into the collection, the thornier, and perhaps more irreconcilable the assessment of his subject matter becomes. “My theme,” he writes in ""The Evangelical Emissary,"" “which I have been approaching indirectly, is the erosion of the system of ideas and customs which form the American way of life.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>America’s founders, fattened on the Enlightenment, viewed progress as an idea wedded as much to a moral awakening as it was to a scientific subjugation of nature and its resources. California, the terminus of Manifest Destiny, epitomized a maddened reinvention in response to a reinvention. It elaborated on a radical obsession to wipe the slate clear, to start from virgin land for this fresh nation of new men, “the brazen arrogance of the ego not ashamed to proclaim it cared only for itself,” as Miłosz called it in “The Events in California.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Miłosz, historical consciousness was indispensable to nations and cultures, something that augmented people as they moved forward through time. “The awareness of one’s origins,” he wrote in <em>Native Realm</em>, “is like an anchor line plunged into the deep, keeping one within a certain range. Without it, historical intuition is virtually impossible.” Absent this regard among the “forward thinkers” for whom barbaric allowances are still “regrettable but inevitable” aspects of progress, is it any surprise then that America’s amnestic approach toward its origins—its sense of self largely a children’s book amalgamation of myths and legends primed for adults with increasingly childlike aspirations—would form a distressingly arrogant and merciless exceptionalism? Perhaps Big Tech’s greatest feat is the swiftness with which <em>these</em> “Enlightened” men came to remake the world in an image of <em>their</em> own choosing with absolutely no interest or regard for contrasting, independent or autonomous worldviews. Writing in “Tiger,” Miłosz believed that Americans</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">accepted their society as if it had arisen from the very order of nature; so saturated with it were they that they tended to pity the rest of humanity for having strayed from the norm… They did not realize that the opposite disablement affected them: Loss of the sense of history, and, therefore, of a sense of the tragic, which is only born of historical experience.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong>In 1945, Miłosz released <em>Ocalenie</em></strong><em> </em></strong>to an annihilated city<em>.</em> Containing some of his most startling and vivid poems, <em>Ocalenie</em>—as a book <em>and </em>a word—signified salvation or deliverance. It was exactly what Poles needed at the time. In 1973, Miłosz, alongside Peter Dale Scott, began translating work for his <em>Selected Poems</em>. Scott had “never before met such critical acuity combined with such passionate erudition and love of words.” Yet, much to Scott’s bewilderment, Miłosz opted to significantly alter the tone of a number of pieces from his seminal collection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many takes on the art of translation. The nature of language essentially guarantees <em>some</em> irrevocable loss in meaning or felicity of phrasing between tongues; call it the conversion fee, like the one you encounter at a currency exchange. Despite Scott’s reservations, Miłosz insisted on rendering “Ocalenie” as “Rescue” in the published book. He changed “Przedmowa” (which means “Forward” or “Preface”) to “Dedication,” and, despite its famous tone-establishing beginning and ending, he moved it from the beginning to the middle, thus altering the original theme.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Haven, Miłosz was “gradually turning away from the vatic tradition [of poetry], remembering the effect it had on an idealistic generation of young men who gave their lives in a gesture of futile resistance and were buried in the wreckage of Warsaw.” He set his sights on adapting his work for an American audience whose traditions and expectations for poetry were different. These were the days of Vietnam after all. One could interpret the prevailing mood among many young Americans (certainly the ones at Berkeley) to be unreceptive to Western traditions of morality and faith when young men had good reason to fear their own birthdays and gruesome images from the conflict in Southeast Asia dominated the airwaves, rightful grievances the youth blamed on what Miłosz dubbed “mental inertia of the older generation.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miłosz, sometime leftist and always independent thinker notwithstanding, was born and raised in a deeply religious culture. He remained a faithful Catholic his entire life. In Poland, “the Catholic paradigm that has endured for two millennia informs every level of society. It sees the family, not the individual, as the building block of community.” In America, his status as exile was reinforced by his feelings of isolation amid the near ubiquity of Protestant concepts. It is impossible to imagine Czesław Miłosz—intimidating eyebrows, mien, and all—making deliberate changes to his poems in response to the popular mood. It is worthwhile, however, looking at the connotations of these words as they passed from one tongue to another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Words give form to our urges. Likewise they color, for better and worse, the tenor of our time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">“Salvation” may have been too overt an invocation of spiritual concepts, sure. As Haven points out, Western society was continuing a long-running turn away from art and religion to science and technology to answer age-old questions. But “rescue” as an act and a <em>promise</em> may have revealed an innate understanding of the American psyche. As it was then (and to an extent exists today), entrenched Lefties determined to rescue Americans from the hang-ups that held their society back engaged in a tug-of-war with Nixon’s conservative contingent working hard to rescue the citizenry from lawlessness and cultural dissolution. (On a purely pop-cultural note, in 1972 going on ’73, the youth culture could be quick to associate “Deliverance” with John Boorman’s 1972 box-office smash of the same name starring Burt Reynolds and John Voight in which city slickers are given a horrifying awakening during their attempt to convene with nature, exposing a grim portrait of mankind never quite before depicted on mainstream screens.) By altering a word here and there, Miłosz channeled urgencies and tendencies that were floating around in the American zeitgeist. Words give form to our urges. Likewise they color, for better and worse, the tenor of our time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Surrounded by student protestors, counter-culturalists, and Black Panthers, Miłosz’s work had to grow and morph in California as Berkeley began to rage and burn. “America” as a culture, still something of an awkward youth when compared even to Poland, burned with the flames of many explosive concepts—most of which were either juvenilely half-baked or overcooked in the lard of capitalist virtue. But the question remained: rescue or salvation? Perhaps what drew Miłosz to the works of America’s vatic poets—Whitman, Jeffers, Ginsberg (although he had reservations about each)—even as he was turning away from the “lofty hopes for poetry” he’d had in his youth, was some sense of divine madness and spiritual daring. Each channeled a truly radical approach to human wisdom while maintaining, to varying degrees, an orthodox approach to the calling. For Miłosz, the poet’s role was one of responsibility to beauty <em>and</em> sustenance: “What is poetry which does not save / Nations or people?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Miłosz acknowledged the near impossibility of his endeavor to bridge two dissociated entities: the rational and the divine. “He’s a poet, not a philosopher,” observed poet Robert Hass. “A lot of his ways of thinking about things are very instinctive.” As a witness, Miłosz was on a quest for some eternal truths, perhaps some authenticity of experience and transcendence. Perhaps our civilization, never having internalized a sense of place and a sense of <em>esse</em> despite amassing wealth far beyond the wildest dreams of the Spanish kings, clings to material objects and a restless acquisitiveness as a way to find purchase in an eternal state of flux.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These terms—“authentic,” “spiritual,” or “transcendent”—have become highly marketable today, hot commodities for developers and social media gurus alike in an attempt to fuel the ceaseless furnace of capitalism. The relentless emphasis on tomorrow, the brighter things that will be ours if we submit today so we may forget our yesterdays has been a battle cry in California for at least 150 years. Looking out at a nation of orphans, Miłosz saw that this civilization was prey to the malevolent forces of history which have been at work at least since the days of Canaan. Forebodingly, in “Emigration to America: A Summing Up,” Miłosz, overlooking the endless Pacific flowing out from one of Moloch’s jewel cities, his antennae set to disturbances far in the future, wrote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The last spiritual remnants of the epoch of the steam engine are already disintegrating and dying out; man has found himself before something still unnamed and though his consciousness lags behind general transformations, he does perceive that everything happening now to our entire species is enormous, ominous, and perhaps ultimate.</p>

<p><strong>“Americans,” Haven writes</strong>, “often overlook how much their cultural and historical sensibility has been shaped around a radical Protestantism, with an emphasis on individualism, hard work, and private revelation… Americans are always seeking quirky and idiosyncratic means of personal ‘salvation’ and enlightenment…” Alongside the gambit for the moon, the microwave foods, the Ford Mustangs, faith and redemption in the face of growth and acquisition helped make this nation—in the words of H. L. Mencken—“incomparably the greatest show on earth.” Miłosz, back in the 1960s and 70s, must have noted the many curious, swirling influences on the Californian mind—the spiritual quacks and gurus and Technicolored oddballs promising a top-down revamp. He had, according to Haven, “entered a world whose ethos was formed by this turbulent sensibility, contributing to an anomic society trapped in restless Gatsby-like self-reinvention, self-expression, paleo diets, and earth-worship, in the undying quest to make a more perfect ‘me.’” Where, in all this <em>stuff</em>, did poetry fit?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While exploring Miłosz’s resistance to duplicating the role of the <em>wieszcz</em>, the vatic poet of Polish tradition, in America, Haven asks, </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">What did it mean to water the ashes of the dead in a country that defied death with its ubiquitous youth culture, its consumerism, its television commercials and plastic surgery, the desolating emptiness of its deserts stretching to the horizon? What did a stance of ‘resistance’ mean? A resistance to what?</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Miłosz was consciously leaping into a new, hybrid state of being and expressing—that of the exile. Constantly feeling, translating, resisting, communicating, while the terms around him chafed against their meanings as quickly as he appraised them. At a certain point, as Haven observes, “he lets go.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But never his responsibility. Haven recounts an episode when a fire broke out on the Berkeley campus in 1969. “What makes them rage is that they have too much,” he famously growled. While on the surface his disapproval carried with it the conservative establishment, he empathized with the student’s frustrations, if not their methods. Miłosz wrote of the incident:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The strength of the collective emotion was not in proportion to the causes of their dissatisfaction, [which were] trivial if viewed rationally… [This] was a vicarious discharge: The university authorities were treated as representatives of authority in general. The students… were united by the tacit, and for them, obvious premise that any authority issuing from an evil system and protecting that system was itself pure evil.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Insofar as academics could be considered representatives of “evil systems,” Miłosz’s first-hand experience with the regimes of both Hitler and Stalin forced him to consider just how it is people are supposed to differentiate the truly evil acts from the quotidian and mundane moments of human weakness, a consideration the youth simply could not yet fathom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The young Americans wanted change “now!” The “authorities” cowered. Even while “suspect, his reasoning often elusive and politically ambiguous, and grounded in experiences a world away,” Miłosz noted:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">These young people were inspired by the best intentions… Nevertheless I was one of the few professors who dared to vote in the university senate against some of the absurd proposals presented—for example, a proposal to abolish the study of foreign languages. Most of the faculty behaved in an incredibly cowardly and conformist fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Flawed instructors balancing the devil of responsibility and authority on one shoulder with the devil of mortgage payments and social status on the other. There’s “pure evil.” Still, those concessions never went the mile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stifled in their quest to remake their world, the student revolutionaries eventually tired out and cashed in, from Wall Street to Hollywood to Silicon Valley, reared as they were on a system that was never fundamentally up for debate. Their dabbling in radical politics had been little more than a rite of passage, something many middle-class liberals considered as integral—and as disposable—as baby teeth. And the conformism many of them later engaged in—the yearning to own property in a fashionable middle class burg, to hold court in fine, wood-paneled restaurants in Allen Ginsberg’s cities of Moloch, their peers' eyes glowing with wonder, glee, or envy—was merely a more urbane and liberal brand of “the American dream.” Intimate with the suffering that superseded the hopes of party ideology, Miłosz’s belief in the role of poetry as a way <em>through</em>, toward a path of goodness, was intrinsic to his hopes for human progress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“America was a land where everything was too big, too moneyed, too lavish,” he complained during fits of occasional exile malaise, “and populated by self-centered people who were too focused on their own consumerist comfort to care about anything besides themselves.” As the decades wore on and new fits of political protest were stymied by newer, flashier, more encompassing products and louder, more charismatic—and duplicitous—heads of state, Miłosz’s work withdrew more and more into the realm of the spiritual and the arcane. “Once again everything becomes embroiled and unclear,” he wrote in <em>Striving Towards Being,</em> his collected correspondence from the 1960s with the theologian Thomas Merton. In “Facing Too Large An Expanse” he expanded, “now I seek shelter in these pages, but my humanistic zeal has been weakened by the mountains and the ocean, by those many moments when I have gazed upon boundless immensities with a feeling akin to nausea, the wind ravaging my little homestead of hopes and intentions.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Early in October</strong> <strong>of 1980</strong>, Czesław Miłosz’s quiet, contemplative life atop Grizzly Peak was upended when he won the Nobel Prize. In his acceptance lecture, he addressed the poetic necessities and desires of engagement with <em>être</em> (or contemplating and capturing things as they are) and the more pressing, societal requests of <em>devenir</em> (or participating in ushering in what’s to come). Throughout his life he’d been faced with the choice between artistic vision and solidarity with one’s fellow man in resistance. His conclusion? “All art proves to be nothing compared with action… To embrace reality in such a manner that it is preserved in all its old tangle of good and evil, of despair and hope, is possible only thanks to a distance, only by soaring <em>above</em> it—but this in turn seems then a moral treason.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Miłosz’s concern and deep interest in environmental issues, the woes of consumerism, the rights of indigenous peoples, and even trauma theory (“It is possible that there is no other memory than the memory of wounds”) was deeply prescient. Additionally, his first-hand experience of illiberal regimes and their effects on once-liberal societies all make for a collection of subjects that are none other than <em>the</em> major subjects beleaguering overstimulated contemporary minds. Faced with the uncertain future of democratic societies, <em>The Captive Mind </em>captures with startling potency the question of motive: Was it fear, opportunism, or something altogether different that drove conformists and collaborators?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his review of <em>The Captive Mind</em>, Irving Howe wrote: “There was also embedded in the totalitarian idea some darkly magnetic force, some delusion of a false collective to which intellectuals were at least as susceptible as proletarians, students, and peasants.” The desire to<em> belong</em> is not only a vital element of being human, but the intrinsic element manipulated by totalitarianism. What’s curious about today’s mythic struggle for this nation’s soul is the conviction that what stands to be saved is liberty itself, while the only way to achieve this is to conform to increasingly crippling and absolutist ideologies spurred by paranoia. Whatever cheap myth Americans were hawked in school for the last century or so has run out. Now, in the adulthood of this nation, a vicious family drama plays out between those committed to protecting a diluted—borderline delusional—vainglorious history and those who will stop at nothing until every closet door is opened and every last skeleton dumped on the living room floor. But to what end? And what role is the drama expected to play in stymying the reckless, willfully ignorant, growth-obsessed ruling class?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>&nbsp;It is up to us to be active participants, and to learn not to rely on or cede increasing chunks of our humanity to those for whom our humanity is but a commodity. Power lies in the exploitation of faith and trust. History can neither be bested nor undone, it merely is.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">While Miłosz did not live to greet the full maturation of neoliberalism’s love child with Big Tech, I don’t believe he needed to witness the proliferation of entrepreneurism as the new human apex, or the deterioration of the imagination in a society completely taken in by capitalist realism, to have intuited that totalitarianism could return, albeit in a more complex and evolved form congenial to the tenets of a digital world. Too many of his poems read like tender warnings. But is guilt the American inheritance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a witness to the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Miłosz’s writing leaves the burden of work on us, on how we are to interpret his interpretations. According to his close friend Aleksander Fiut, the most important thing in Miłosz’s life was redemption. So how will mankind redeem itself? “All of us yearn naively for a certain point on the earth where the highest wisdom accessible to humanity at a given moment dwells,” Miłosz wrote in “Tiger,” “and it is hard to admit that such a point does not exist, that we have to rely only upon ourselves.” What one finds boiling under Miłosz’s reserve is a radical engagement with notions of truth, despair, and revelation. Life is both a causal chain and a calculus at heaven. Personal agency is crucial if a secular, liberal society is to function.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The science of life depends on the gradual discovery of fundamental truths,” Miłosz wrote in <em>Visions from San Francisco Bay.</em> The impetus is on us, not merely to unleash the self-actualized capitalist brand dying to climb out and make a fortune, but to make this world—and our role in it—a reflection of what we truly value most. It is up to us to be active participants, and to learn not to rely on or cede increasing chunks of our humanity to those for whom our humanity is but a commodity. Power lies in the exploitation of faith and trust. History can neither be bested nor undone, it merely is. Haven, exceptionally well-versed in Miłosz’s work, suggests his oeuvre consists of “an ancient quarrel with the cruelty of the universe and the inevitability of suffering,” one where the poems often end “with beauty, only stated as a challenge.” With <em>Czesław Miłosz: A California Life</em>, Haven succeeds in portraying a person grappling interminably with this challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>California is a young civilization, but it is no longer unprecedented, and as such no longer excusable. There is a grave vastness beyond the imported palm trees, the sweeping vistas, and the crashing mantra of the Pacific, a vastness of responsibility. History is like an ill-fitting suit, always present, always a reminder of how far you’ve come—or gone—from somewhere else. What can we learn from Miłosz? For Haven, this is it: “this art, a twinning of vision and historical consciousness. One sings of the future, and in its singing creates what it has sung; the other looks backward, soberly, keenly aware of how our finest intentions go awry, how closely evil bites our heels. Together, they mark the distance between being and becoming.”</p>

2138,"The World Dick Made","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>ONE DAY IN JULY 1974</strong>, shortly after the Supreme Court ruling that released the Nixon tapes, Philip K. Dick was craving Chinese. The legendary sci-fi author went to his local spot in Yorba Linda, less than a mile from Richard Nixon’s childhood home. At the end of his meal, he cracked open a fortune cookie. Its message read: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Deeds Done In Secret Have A Way of Becoming Found Out</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dick—who hated Nixon—saw the fortune as more than mere coincidence. In fact, the author didn’t believe in coincidence anymore. Five months earlier, a startling vision had&nbsp; changed his life. The world he occupied was no longer one of historical happenstance, but a simulation imposed by a divine conspiracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, Dick mailed his fortune to the White House. In his letter, he noted the restaurant’s proximity to Nixon’s birthplace, and wrote: “I think a mistake has been made; by accident I got Mr. Nixon’s fortune. Does he have mine?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The White House never responded. Nixon would resign two weeks later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Like most Californians of his generation</strong>, Philip Kindred Dick wasn’t born in the state. He and his twin sister Jane were born in Chicago on December 16, 1928. Six weeks later, Jane died—a loss that Dick considered formative. At age five, his parents split, taking him across the country. Perhaps to avoid the familial drama, he found solace in the pulp magazines of the youth. Publications like <em>Amazing Stories</em> and <em>Wonder Tales</em>—with their starship captains and shape-shifting reptilians—made his struggles feel remote. He and his mother finally settled in Berkeley in the 1940s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sickly and reclusive, Dick was the resident ghost of Berkeley High School. Despite graduating alongside Ursula K. Le Guin (author of sci-fi masterwork <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>), neither recall meeting during their time at Berkeley High. Indeed, Le Guin would later claim that “absolutely no one” remembered Dick. His photo wasn’t even in the yearbook.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dick eventually found a home in the Bay Area. It provided his first job, his first house, his first marriage (of five), stints in artists’ lofts, and exposure to the burgeoning intellectual scene around UC Berkeley. Shifts at local electronics shops sparked his fascination with technology—especially the new medium of television. Half a semester at the university introduced him to classical philosophy, leading to the central questions of his life:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is reality? Can we trust the world around us? Can truth be found in what we read in newspapers, hear on the radio, and watch on TV? Or is there something deeper, something arcane, that a grand conspiracy keeps us from realizing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 1951, Dick was writing full-time, selling his first story to <em>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction </em>that year. Combining the outlandish speculations of his childhood pulp magazines with a paranoic outlook, Dick quickly developed his distinctive voice. Post-nuclear wastelands (“Pay for the Printer”), android saboteurs (“Imposter”), and duplicitous aliens (“The Cosmic Poachers”) feature prominently. The same themes would appear in his novels, which he wrote in manic two-week sessions, propelled by handfuls of amphetamines and the anxieties of the nuclear age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like Nixon, Dick’s views were shaped by the Cold War. But while Nixon was hunting imaginary communists with the House Un-American Activities Committee, Dick was imagining the futures implied by such planetary paranoia. His ‘50s work pushed a recurring lineup of colonels and company men through the ringer, often trapping them within their own suspicions and greed. Few of his contemporaries managed such razor-sharp satire of the times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dick struggled financially. Although his work impressed genre editors like Anthony Boucher and Donald A. Wollheim, it was seen as pulp, and paid accordingly. While sci-fi luminaries like Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury enjoyed widespread recognition, Dick was relegated to the second tier, his novels condensed onto the flip sides of cheap paperbacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That changed in 1962, when Putnam published <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>. His only novel to win a Hugo, the book presents an alternate history where the Axis wins the Second World War. Divided between Japanese and German forces, many Americans adapt to their new fascist overlords. But pockets of resistance remain. A subversive book circulates among the population. Written by a reclusive author in the badlands of Colorado, ""The Grasshopper Lies Heavy"" depicts a dangerous vision for the occupiers: an alternate history where the Allies won the war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Dick, who longed for acceptance in the literary mainstream, the award was bittersweet. He’d written ten realist novels over the previous decade, none of which had sold. After the Hugo, his agent returned the unpublished manuscripts and encouraged him to stick with sci-fi. Dick relinquished his dream of becoming a “respectable” author and doubled down on the weird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2171,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""http://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/philip-dick-collection-three-volumes_1_8aa5a1c07cb15f29fa3e831aab0b5f70-e1678489761897.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2171""/><figcaption>Dick's work has since been collected by the Library of America</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Over the next two years, Dick wrote no less than eleven novels, whose conspiratorial plots make <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> seem tame. Take <em>The Game-Players of Titan</em> (1963), wherein a Chinese weapon sterilizes humanity, and telepathic slugs force the survivors to play a game called Bluff. Or <em>Clans of the Alphane Moon</em> (1964), which finds a divorced CIA agent on an alien moon governed entirely by psychiatric patients. And then there’s the consummately unhinged <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> (1965), in which a drug-peddling cyborg bankrolls the replacement of reality with the communal visions of an alien hallucinogen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite his moderate success, Dick was troubled. Pill-popping, abusive, and evading the IRS, the writer’s incessant suspicions quickly destroyed his third marriage. They would soon upend more than that. On a walk to his Point Reyes writer’s studio, Dick had a vision. The skies around his home ripped open. A metallic face with empty eye sockets appeared, its vacant stare boring into Dick’s soul. Dick considered it an omen. Something he’d suspected for a long time became an unavoidable truth: The world was not what it seemed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>To call Philip K. Dick paranoid</strong> would be an understatement. But in the tumultuous 1960s, he was hardly alone. A decade of civil unrest, Cold War standoffs, and Kennedy assassinations proved fertile ground for conspiracies on both the left and the right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around the time of Dick’s third divorce, Richard Hofstadter’s seminal essay, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” appeared in <em>Harper’s Magazine</em>. In it, Hofstadter covered the conspiratorial legacy of the United States, tracing the right’s paranoia—perpetually hunting for communists, subversives, and moral degenerates—back to the anti-Masonic phobias of the 1800s. But in the postwar years, he argued, this rhetoric had swelled beyond the fringes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Events since 1939 have given the contemporary right-wing paranoid a vast theatre for his imagination ... replete with realistic cues and undeniable proofs of the validity of his suspicions.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the characters in Dick’s novels, recalcitrant Americans woke up in a country they no longer recognized, and at the mercy of forces they barely understood. Desegregation, welfare protections, and international treaties were framed as apocalyptic harbingers of a “New World Order.” According to Hofstadter, many came to believe that “the whole apparatus of education, religion, the press, and the mass media [was] engaged in a common effort to paralyze the resistance of loyal Americans.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such sweeping conspiracies pop up constantly in Dick’s work. But his paranoia went far beyond his fiction. Indeed, “paranoia” scarcely captures the extent of Dick’s neuroses. Yet, although he became increasingly detached from reality throughout the ‘60s, the personal and political crises that led to his repeated breakdowns were undeniably real.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example: Dick believed he was under FBI surveillance, claiming his stereo system had been bugged in the early ‘50s. In fact, two FBI agents <em>had</em> visited his home then, hoping to identify political activists out of UC Berkeley. While there’s no evidence his Magnavox was tapped, the fact that government agents would canvas Berkeley for potential agitators illustrates the suspicions animating the American psyche at the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>With a subplot that sees a white nationalist appointed to a government advisory board, <em>The Zap Gun</em>’s depiction of a culture blinded by its own delusions has only become more relevant.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Nowhere is this tension—between specious conspiracies and their basis in historical anxieties—more apparent than in Dick’s critically underappreciated novel <em>The Zap Gun </em>(1967)<em>. </em>Written the same year as Hofstadter’s essay, the book epitomizes the absurdities of Cold War paranoia. It follows Lars Powderdry, the preeminent “weapons fashion” designer for West-bloc, an authoritarian hybrid of the UN and NATO. Locked in an arms race with the People’s East (a Sino-Soviet superstate), Lars’ job is to invent new weapons for the West-bloc military.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But unbeknownst to the public, the weapons fashion business is a sham. The real arms race ended years ago, via secretive “protocols” signed in Iceland. Lars’ designs—which he dreams up through drug-induced hyperdimensional trances—are repurposed as consumer goods. As he watches a televised pseudo-demonstration of his newest weapon, Lars ponders its futility. People across the country tune in to see the faked destruction, finding an uneasy comfort in it, leading Lars to conclude that viewers “liked displays of power because they felt powerless themselves.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a subplot that sees a white nationalist appointed to a government advisory board, <em>The Zap Gun</em>’s depiction of a culture blinded by its own delusions has only become more relevant. And like a convoluted QAnon message board, it’s conspiracies all the way down: Lars’ hyperdimensional trances turn out to be another sham. His designs are siphoned from the mind of a deranged comic book artist, further blurring the line between fiction and reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Dick didn’t just traffic in fictional conspiracy theories: He lived them too. By the time of Nixon’s inauguration (and another failed marriage), Dick lived in a glorified drug den in Santa Venetia. Friends came and went, Dick holding court over days-long benders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1971, shortly after Nixon ordered a raid on the Brookings Institution, things came to a head: Someone broke into Dick’s home, blew up his safe, and stole his manuscripts. They also took his stereo. The theft—which Dick blamed on everyone from the Black Panthers to the KGB—prompted him to abandon the Bay Area for good. The experience also provided the spark for his excellent <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> (1977).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a neo-noir about a group of delusional addicts, the novel is paradoxically Dick’s most cohesive. It’s also his best portrayal of the conspiratorial American mind, with deadbeat characters proposing Byzantine explanations for their plights, even as they spy and snitch on one another. Everything from car troubles to an unlocked front door becomes evidence of the conspiracies against them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But <em>Scanner</em>’s characters aren’t just paranoid—they’re psychotic. They ward off hallucinatory aphid infestations. They fail to recognize themselves in surveillance footage. An undercover narc comes to believe he’s two different people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This distinction between paranoia and psychosis, often explored in Dick’s work, also presents a contemporary revision to Hofstadter’s thesis. His “paranoid style” has given way to a “psychotic style” in American politics, and its legacy is visible in Philip K. Dick at his most unhinged. As Watergate upended the country, Dick made his final leap into conspiracy: He saw God.</p>

<p><strong>Richard Nixon was</strong> the mid-century left’s de facto conspiracy beacon. For Dick and many others, all theories—from JFK to the moon landing—led back to Nixon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Norman Spinrad, Dick’s friend and fellow author, often discounted his conspiratorial ramblings. But in an interview for Lawrence Sutin’s definitive biography, <em>Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick</em>, he recalled how Dick’s views were vindicated by Nixon’s downfall:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Everything Phil thought about the government turned out to be true. Anybody [like him] would be regarded as paranoid and crazy until Watergate broke...
<br>
<br>
Phil told me another “paranoid” story. He said, “These guys called me up from a Stanford University radio station, came down and asked me all these weird questions. Then when I called Stanford I found out the radio station didn’t exist.” Sounds like more Phil paranoia, except [they did] the same thing to me … two guys showed up and took me to dinner, asked me … all this shit. I’m sure they were agents for some agency.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watergate led to a reckoning from which American politics never recovered. Faced with a toxic combination of domestic surveillance and the twin Cold War threats of subterfuge and nuclear annihilation, many Americans believed the conspiracists had been proved right. Paranoia gave way to conviction. If the president was a crook, lies and deceptions really were all around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As it turned out, Nixon was as conspiratorial as the best of them. The White House tapes revealed a man who saw enemies everywhere, including the prime minister of Sweden, Ivy League intellectuals, and, of course, “the Jews.” Indeed, Dick and Nixon are focal points in the multifaceted lens of American conspiracy theories: stare through one long enough, and glimpses of the others appear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the administration’s collapse represented more than just a breakdown of public trust for Dick. For him, it was the latest salvo in a cosmic battle between good and evil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On February 20, 1974, in the depths of national crisis, Dick had a tooth pulled. After administering a “tremendous amount of sodium pentothal” for the procedure, the dentist sent him home. But the numbing wasn’t enough. Dick called a pharmacy, filled his prescription, and awaited delivery. When his painkillers arrived, Dick noticed a fish symbol on the delivery girl’s necklace. She explained that it was the <em>ichthys</em>, a shibboleth used by early Christians. As she displayed it, sunlight glinted off its surface. In an instant, Dick found himself transported back to ancient Rome, in the guise of a persecuted Christian. In fact, a voice told him, he <em>was</em> an ancient Christian. His <em>life</em> was the illusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dick considered it a theophany—direct contact with a divine presence. He would refer to this presence by many names: The AI Voice. Firebright. The Programmer. A “Vast Active Living Intelligence System” (VALIS). Zebra. Over the next month, he encountered it night after night. His unplugged radio spoke to him. Abstract art pieces flashed behind his eyelids. A pink “phosphene afterimage” warned that his son was terminally ill. When Dick took him to the doctor, a hernia was discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These visions—which Dick referred to collectively as “2-3-74,” and fictionalized in his arduous 1981 novel <em>VALIS</em>—vexed the author for the rest of his life. He obsessively documented his experiences, filling over 8000 pages of loose-leaf paper with his hypotheses. Known as his <em>Exegesis</em>, it may be the clearest portrait of a mind on the edge of psychosis ever compiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Exegesis</em> is full of messianic theorizing. And like a mid-century Q with nowhere to post, Dick portrayed himself as the sole prophet of a new era.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some ways, he was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dick’s “schizophrenic turn” has been pathologized by various biographers, explained away as temporal lobe epilepsy or the side effects of long-term drug abuse. Dick himself, a lifelong fan of self-diagnoses, identified with everything from manic-depression to paranoid schizophrenia. But there are cultural factors to consider as well. Indeed, it’s possible to frame his “therapeutic psychosis” as a symptom of the psychotic style developing in American discourse – something brought on as much by his environment as his predispositions.</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>According to the DSM</strong>—the psychopathologist’s bible—schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, incoherent speech, erratic behavior, and emotional dysregulation. Fundamentally, it involves an abnormal interpretation of reality, resulting in bizarre reconstructions of cause and effect, and typified by continual or episodic psychosis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After 2-3-74, Dick seemed to fit this bill. His perception of reality and the worlds of his imagination converged. He claimed to live through scenes in his books that were, unbeknownst to him, actually scenes from the bible—as if he’d both predicted the future and rewritten the past. His writing sessions lasted through sunrise, even without the amphetamines he’d kicked. In a letter to Le Guin—whom he’d begun corresponding with in the early ‘70s—he maintained that an otherworldly force had beamed sacred knowledge directly to his brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dick laid out the vast cosmology he developed over this period in an infamous 1977 speech. Entitled “If You Find this World Bad, You Should See Some of the Others,” he proposed to an incredulous French audience that Jesus had taught his disciples how to shift between multiversal “matrix worlds,” alleging that we inhabit “a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only was the world a simulation, but its form was determined by cosmic forces. A godlike “Programmer” eternally faced off against a dark “Counter-programmer,” influencing world events and shifting reality in the process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Dick borrowed many of these ideas from Gnostic and Zoroastrian texts, it’s hard not to see the Cold War mentality of dueling superpowers invading his cosmology. Indeed, the premise of two universal forces vying for humanity’s collective conscience would sound familiar to Nixon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, Dick would invoke Nixon as evidence of this cosmic conspiracy the following year. In “How to Build a Universe That Doesn’t Fall Apart Two Days Later,” Dick insisted that Watergate was proof of these higher powers. The Programmer had intervened, and Nixon was the first in a cabal of politicians and businessmen that would be overthrown. This conviction—that political events have transcendental significance, and that evil-doers will be punished—reflects the long history of American conspiracy theories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a modern inversion of Dick’s views, QAnon’s adherents believe that a pedophilic progressive elite is locked in a clandestine battle with the divinely-anointed right. However, like Dick, Q’s followers have gone from paranoid to psychotic. They don’t just promise “the birth and death of whole worlds” à la Hofstadter—they make up new ones as they go along. Constantly updated with the news cycle,<em> everything</em> becomes proof of conspiracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At its core, QAnon is a continuation of right-wing conspiracy theories from the Cold War. But its style exemplifies Dick’s legacy—particularly through the influence of David Icke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Icke—a former BBC sportscaster who built on American arch-conspiracist Milton William Cooper’s work—is the unreferenced source of QAnon’s basic premise. In <em>The Biggest Secret</em> (1999), Icke claimed that a pedophilic global elite ritualistically sacrifices children, draining their blood for its precious adrenochrome. That this elite is controlled by interdimensional “reptoids” from the Draco constellation is usually left unmentioned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s impossible to miss Dick’s influence on Icke’s celestial blathering. Shapeshifting aliens who feed on human suffering and project holographic irrealities from Saturn? That’s the plot of <em>The Game-Players of Titan</em>. Dick, at least, had the wherewithal to consider how these ideas spread. Halfway through “How to Build a Universe,” he addresses the mechanisms of conspiracy: how our viewing, reading, and listening habits produce endless “pseudo-realities,” lulling us into hypnotic, dream-like states. By engaging with mass media: <em>”We have participated unknowingly in the creation of a spurious reality, and then we have obligingly fed it to ourselves.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tragedy is that Dick couldn’t see these processes playing out in himself. His cosmogony is basically a career-spanning elaboration on the finale to his <em>The Cosmic Puppets</em> (1957). As both a chronicler—and a victim—of America’s collective psychoses, Dick fed himself his own reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, the signs of these collective psychoses are everywhere. Apathy, imagined persecution, and delusions of grandeur are so commonplace as to be unremarkable. Conspiracist talking heads vie for attention with purveyors of the status quo. Bombarded by choice, viewers cling to explanatory nonsense for answers. Like Dick at the end of his life, Western culture is no longer capable of separating social fact from the themes of his fiction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On February 17, 1982</strong>, Philip K. Dick had the first in a series of strokes. He died two weeks later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his last months, Dick continued to grapple with his visions. Between instances of associative word salad (another symptom of schizophrenia), the writing in his <em>Exegesis </em>is ecstatic. He truly felt that he had discovered something groundbreaking. As Pamela Jackson and Jonathan Lethem point out in their annotated (and at 944 pages, significantly abridged) <em>The Exegesis of Philip K. Dick</em>, Dick’s fiction—and his struggle with 2-3-74—ultimately dealt with the challenges of <em>revelation</em>. But it’s not just revelation that lies at the heart of Dick’s work. It’s the revelatory power of conspiracy in particular.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it’s one of his best-known novels, many people forget the real twist of <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>. In its final pages, a character tracks down the author of ""The Grasshopper Lies Heavy"" and demands an explanation. What she discovers flips the entire book on its head: In truth, the Allies won the war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The revelation is far more insidious than the set up. Whether this is metafictional commentary or another conspiracy-within-a-conspiracy is never explained. Reality, again, is not what it seems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This tendency to find nested conspiracies—so prevalent in Dick’s sci-fi—is what conspiracists thrive on. Like the citizens of <em>The Zap Gun</em>, revelation alleviates the sense of powerlessness individuals feel in contemporary culture. Appeals to “do your own research” are invitations to interact with the psychotic style, offering disquieting solace in place of actual control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, despite all the crackpot theorizing, there remain indisputably real things that lend credence to Dick’s (and thereby conspiracy theorists’) obsessions. From Watergate to MKUltra to the Tuskegee Study to PRISM, the US government has repeatedly set aside its principles for bizarre, illiberal, and ruthless schemes. But modern conspiracists warp these facts into harebrained plots that could easily appear in a Philip K. Dick novel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And for compelling reasons: the recurring tropes of Dick’s stories—celebrity politics, micro-targeted advertising, news as propaganda, omnipresent surveillance, super-intelligent computers, unaccountable corporations, and the banality of life against a backdrop of nuclear war—have renewed relevance in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Even though Dick’s villains were those of his day—exploitative capitalists and the American, Russian, and Chinese governments—they still dominate headlines forty years later. The Cold War tensions that haunted Dick and Nixon remain central to geopolitics, in spite of a generation of politicians and pundits declaring them solved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The psychotic style of Dick’s life and work reflects&nbsp; how discourse has moved beyond truth to relieve that dissonance. But understanding that reality is irreducible to its portrayals, as Dick often reminded us, leads to more questions than answers, opening national narratives to the conspiratorial delusions we see today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet, for all his speculations, Dick harbored his doubts until the very end. He frequently questions his sanity in the <em>Exegesis</em>, never sure of his own theories. It’s easy to imagine a more devious Philip K. Dick as an L. Ron Hubbard figure, duping thousands into a contrived religion. In that way, at least, he separated himself from the worst excesses of the conspiracists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dick’s fixations still guide modern life: We still turn to our screens for news and entertainment. We still relish the sordid details of political scandal. America Inc. still competes with a nominally-communist rival for global dominance. And conspiracy theorists still concoct strangely-believable fantasies to explain it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, if you believe we’re on the precipice of a “new” Cold War; if you think truth can be found by watching the right channels; if you believe buying different brands makes you a revolutionary; if you think voting for unqualified demagogues will “drain the swamp”; if you believe billionaire tech founders will really make the world a better place—well, then you don’t know Dick.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Water Always Wins: Thriving in an Age of Drought and Deluge<br>
by Erica Gies<br>
University of Chicago Press, 2022<br>
$26.00</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN 1961, THE SHORES OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY</strong> were an industrial playground of debris and dereliction. Ninety percent of its original wetlands had been destroyed, and what remained was either inaccessible or ripe with sewage. But as the population in each of the Bay Area’s coastal cities continued to grow, so too did their demand for land. Berkeley, for example, drew up a plan to submerge a further 2,000 acres, extending itself a mile into the water. At this rate of drainage, the Army Corps of Engineers complacently projected that the Bay would be no bigger than a narrow shipping channel by 2020. Everyone, it seemed, felt that the water was beyond saving. Everyone, that is, but Kay Kerr, Sylvia McLaughlin, and Ester Gulick, who, with the help of their well-connected spouses (Kerr’s husband, Clark Kerr, was the president of the University of California), friends in high places, and constituents, launched the “Save the Bay” campaign that would preserve the Bay from development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The San Francisco Bay is just one of many aqueous battlegrounds that Erica Gies, a west coast environmental journalist, visits in her new book, <em><a href=""https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo161589950.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Water Always Wins: Thriving in an Age of Drought and Deluge</a></em>. From cities to microbes, Gies guides us through the various ways that the forces of human development contest—or coexist—with forces of nature. Her book is a sort of water map that details various locations both above and below the surface where geopolitical conflict, misguided natural resource management, and poor urban planning, among myriad other human shortcomings, have led to droughts, deluge, and other calamities.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the waypoints on Gies’s map is Chennai, India, a coastal city that ran out of drinking water in 2019—a strange event for a city built on top of the Pallikaranai Marsh. The headlines shocked the world. But, as Gies notes, residents of Chennai were already primed to the frightening effects of water scarcity, having learned to plan their day around the few morning hours when potable tap water is accessible. Once connected to rivers, backwaters, coastal estuaries, and mangrove forests, Chennai’s years of industrial development—including impervious cement and water drainage canals to divert storm water—prevented annual monsoons from replenishing the groundwater while increasing the city’s susceptibility to destructive flooding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, in the Mesopotamian marshes of Iraq (also known by biblical scholars as Eden) the Ma’dan have been struggling to maintain their traditional livelihoods amid political and developmental threats that have turned the area into a parched landscape. By building just about everything from native grasses, residents of the Al-Hammar Marsh employ a style of “amphibious housing” in accordance with the natural ecosystem. But their way of life was threatened with extinction in the 1990s when Saddam Hussein ordered the marshes to be drained, burned, and poisoned to prevent Shiite rebels from hiding there. Although the marshes have recovered to some extent, their health continues to be compromised by climate change, water diversions, and upstream dams. The viability of traditional ways of marsh-dwelling life remains in question.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Beneath these historical flashpoints, Gies digs into the science. From the microbial matter of substrate that nourishes stream ecosystems to the interconnected networks of water-retaining wetlands, she weaves us through the complexities of hydrology and the nuanced magic that happens below earth’s surface. Much of her research reveals what we cannot see—like ancient paleo valleys that help mitigate flooding, macroinvertebrates whose tunnels improve soil aeration and water flow, and microbes who create food for other lifeforms, transfer organic matter between the soil, and even aid in filtering petroleum leaks. The subtlety of these processes is perhaps the primary reason humans have found it so difficult to surrender to water—and so blindsided when water finally decides to fight back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gies’s solution is to develop a more harmonious relationship with water and begin seeing this powerful force as a friend instead of foe. Informed by the research of various “water detectives” (like Yu Kongjian studying “sponge cities” in China, Graham Fogg researching groundwater hydrology in the Central Valley, or Boris Ochoa-Tocachi consulting Peruvians on how to integrate indigenous traditions into modern water management) and the behavioral patterns of mother nature herself, Gies encourages us to turn away from our propensity for speed and instead embrace “slow water,” the type that sits and settles, especially in places we are quick to drain and develop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some areas of slow water are more aesthetically pleasing, like the lakes, ponds, and dams <em>&nbsp;</em>glossing neighborhood fliers and travel brochures. Others require a little more warming up to, like the handiwork of a beaver, whose water-filtering and habitat-providing dams usually involve an unaesthetic disarray of twigs and chewed logs. Or the floodplains, marshes, and wetlands that grant sustenance to birds and insects, spaces for interacting waterways to exchange nutrients and filter water, and time for water to trickle into the subsurface. Slow water can even exist miles below the surface in the hyporheic zone, also known as the “liver of the river,” responsible for modulating surface-level water temperature, oxygenating water, and filtering and decomposing waste. Gies is quick to qualify that slow water isn’t always pretty, but maintaining its health is essential if we want to keep things from getting ugly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The consequences of draining and developing land prone to “slow water” hit especially close to home. California is still recovering from a recent spate of atmospheric rivers that uprooted venerable trees, overwhelmed infrastructure, and devastated communities. Overdeveloping the California coast brings its consequences too. Gies warns that by 2100 rising sea levels will displace between 190 and 630 million globally. Ironically, the destroyed marshes the Bay Area rests upon would have been prime candidates for keeping up with sea level rise. Restoration projects are underway, but the marsh needs room to grow, and the space it wants is occupied by urban infrastructure, such as the Google and Facebook campuses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Restoring our relationship with water also means acquiescing to water’s memory, which is far more reliable than our own. It’s easy to forget, Gies tells us, that iconic landscapes like the oak woodlands of California’s Central Valley used to be wetlands, drained and diked to provide water for the state’s agricultural production, or that what is known today as the Corn Belt used to be a swamp. In the Midwest, generations of drainage have ingrained such a commitment to modern methods that when the Army Corps of Engineers tried to restore habitat through levee removal, they were sued by local residents for attempting “military hydrological complex projects.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with any battle, finding a more mutually beneficial solution to our water woes won’t be easy. But, as Gies and her counterparts stress, the best way to live with water is not to fight it. Whether we acknowledge it or not, “water still wants to flow its innate path,” and it’s up to us to decide if we want to continue getting in its way.</p>

<p><strong><strong>SILENCE IS POWER</strong>. </strong>In conversation, the persistent silence of one unsettles the other, driving the speaker to give more of themselves away as they grasp for a sense of their counterpart. In the case of Joan Didion, her slight frame and tightlipped aura made her both a disarming and formidable presence as a reporter. The woman who said, “I like to sit around and watch people do what they do,” was, after all, the writer that dubbed writing “a hostile act.” Writing, she suggested, was a performance in deception. But what worked so well for her in life—her cool, controlled approach to reflection and deflection—is taking on a curious afterlife. In her absence, we seem to be indulging our need to fill her many long silences with meaning, telling ourselves stories about Joan in order to live.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Joan Didion: What She Means,” curated by <em>New Yorker </em>theater critic Hilton Als for the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, is one such tale. For Ann Philbin, the Hammer’s director, it is “an exhibition as portrait, a narrative of the life of one artist by another.” It is also a striking survey of the many nouns that make up a moment in time, a life. Featuring over 200 separate items—ranging from artworks by a wide range of mid-century artists including Wayne Thiebaud, Betye Saar, Richard Avedon and many more, to personal effects, ephemera, and mementos—the exhibition offers impressive glimpses of the landscape of postwar America, revealing just how close Didion got to the era’s defining cultural booms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The exhibit is organized chronologically into four sections, named after her famous essays: Holy Water: Sacramento, Berkeley (1934-1956); Goodbye to All That: New York (1956-1963); The White Album: California, Hawai’i (1964-1988); and Sentimental Journeys: New York, Miami, San Salvador (1988-2021, despite the fact that both <em>Salvador </em>and <em>Miami</em> were published before 1988). Holy Water in particular furnishes the viewer with a sense of place, the landscape of extremes Didion was born into (Sacramento, 1934), made all the more urgent in our drought-ridden era. Speaking to Linda Kuehl for her first <em>Paris Review</em> interview in 1977, Didion reflected on her inheritance: “I grew up in a dangerous landscape. I think people are more affected than they know by landscapes and weather. Sacramento was a very extreme place… Those extremes affect the way you deal with the world. It so happens that if you’re a writer, the extremes show up.”</p>

<p>Maren Hassinger’s <em>River</em> runs through the center of Holy Water, a 7” x 89” x 358” mixed-media installation made of rope and steel anchor chain—imposing in its bulk and materiality—that, while originally evoking the chains and ropes of enslaved Africans through the Middle Passage, here doubles as an expression of California’s complicated relationship with water. Meanwhile, along one wall, Suzanne Jackson’s acrylic washes evoke Didion’s penchant for spare yet meticulous prose with vibrant yet muted violence. Als’s emphasis on a rich array of African American artists certainly enhances the show, though it speaks more to Als’s end of the dialog than Didion’s. While “Didion knew,” Als is convinced, “that America was built on exclusion: the exclusion of one class or race in favor of another,” Didion herself remained a bit more opaque on such interpretations of American history, her work built a bit more upon investigations of <em>exclusivity</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Opportunities to “spot the Joanie” abound through yearbooks and school photos, before making way to an altar to some of her literary influences: e.g. Ernest Hemingway, Graham Greene, and Norman Mailer. It’s always striking to note how Didion counterbalanced her fragile physical presence, even her femininity, with prose that was so informed by some of the most forcefully masculine figures of 20th century literature. “Novels by women tended to be described… as sensitive,” she told Kuehl, “and I didn’t much like it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the artworks throughout are both contemporaneous and thoughtful evocations or complements to Didion’s work, few are as striking as Vija Celmins’s <em>Gun With Hand #1</em> (1964). Showing an outstretched arm clutching a freshly fired .38 revolver amid a landscape of dusty nothingness, <em>Gun With Hand</em> captures the tone that pervades so much of Didion’s musings on California, especially “Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream,” the opening essay from <em>Slouching Towards Bethlehem. </em>“This is a story about love and death in the golden land,” the essay opens, “and begins with the country.… It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, wherever the wind blows.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time we get to The White Album (1964-1988), the experience pivots to Joan Didion’s entry <em>into</em> history, a doubling of sorts where she is traversing time as a historical actor, her work and her ephemera history <em>itself.</em> Dividing the mid-1960s from the boom period of Didion’s cultural centrality that would follow is “Reel 77 of <em>Four Stars</em>,” a segment depicting waves crashing along the Malibu Coast from Andy Warhol’s 25-hour 1967 avant-garde film, projected floor to ceiling onto a partition while Nico’s ever-haunting voice induces a kind of conscious “drifting.” Between 1965 and 1972 alone, Joan—along with her husband John Gregory Dunne (himself an essential witness through his works <em>Delano, The Studio, </em>and <em>Vegas</em>)—“consciously drifted” into (and reported on) tectonic shifts in the social order of California including Haight-Ashbury, Cesar Chavez and the California Grape strike, the Manson Murders and subsequent trial, the Black Panthers, the slow but steady rise of Las Vegas as an outpost of the western id, and New Hollywood’s ushering in of film culture as epicenter of American intellectual discourse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surrounded by the overwhelming materiality of postwar American culture—a period so relentlessly documented and commodified—it’s deeply impressive to think Didion lived through it all, observed it all, and commented on it all from behind her dark sunglasses and Hermes typewriter. Of course, for Didion, “it was gold” (as she said notoriously of the little girl she saw on LSD in “Slouching”). The exhibition’s strength lies in allowing you an opportunity to <em>feel</em> the period for yourself (you rarely have to read the didactics because so much of what’s displayed speaks for itself). How does it feel to look at five seemingly random Polaroids—until it hits you in the gut there’s absolutely nothing random about them—of pregnant Sharon Tate lounging around poolside, sometimes alone, sometimes beside Jay Sebring? Sometimes, it feels as though history is largely a collection of mishaps fated to irremediable consequence, indeed “the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images,” as Didion suggested in “The White Album.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The exhibit closes, somewhat lacklusterly, with Sentimental Journeys (1988-2001), the era of “Saint Joan.” Ana Mendieta’s <em>Untitled: Silueta Series</em> is a highlight, a haunting collection of abstract black and white photographs which Mendieta hoped would express “an omnipresent female force.” What’s clear, however, is the aura of dormancy that seemed to categorize Didion’s later years, with the exception of her two momentous losses, as though a great ship had been retired from service. There is little added weight to enrich some of the sojourns and involvements Didion embarked on during this period, although a look at the Central Park 5 is an integral highlight. Joan Didion has captivated a strikingly wide array of people, but this latter New York period does make you wonder what it meant to the Californian to be <em>New York</em>’s go-to Californian, particularly in an exhibition curated <em>by</em> a New Yorker.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Didion’s California exists exquisitely in her pages. For anyone passionate about those pages, the passion will continue. But for those more ambivalent about her cultural anointment as Saint Joan of the Golden State, ambivalences will remain. Didion said “being left alone and leaving others alone is regarded by members of my family as the highest form of human endeavor.” The nature of her work clearly refuted that, as have the circumstances following her death. Nevertheless, the mystery at the core of Joan Didion remains.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the show’s “meandering chronology that grapples with the simultaneously personal and distant evolution of Didion’s voice as a writer,” we come no closer to determining which Joan— “Saint Joan” or “Fragile Joan, Mother of Sorrows” or “Cool Joan, Angel of Death”—fits best. Likely, it’s all three and more. Her work is her testament; her life amounts for less despite our unfaltering need to turn such murk into meaning. And Als’s show is a tableau haunted by the ghostly presence of a careful observer, one who followed the currents but resisted its sometimes destructive allure. “A certain amount of resistance is good for anybody,” Didion said. “It keeps you awake.”</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">all except you<br>
by Roland Barthes, transl. by Joe Milutis<br>
punctum books, 2023<br>
$21.00</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN VARIOUS CARTOONS BY SAUL STEINBERG</strong>, the number five makes love to a question mark, a woman smoking a cigarette is actually a chair, and a man greets another man by removing not just his hat, but his whole head. In a cartoon by Saul Steinberg, an airplane is a word—“<em>WHZZT</em>”—with motion lines in its wake (below, on a horizontal line of earth, a man looks up). In a cartoon by Saul Steinberg, a man draws himself into a spiral that may or may not be the world. John Updike called these scenes “wormholes between different universes.” Roland Barthes went further. “<em>Voilá</em>,” he said, the “petite autarkic universe” of Steinberg, “encumbered by heteroclite objects in the middle of which <em>we do not find ourselves</em>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Barthes wrote a book on this universe, posthumously published as <em>all except you </em>in French in 1983. Strangely, the text never appeared in English—until now. Translated and with a commentary by Joe Milutis, <em><a href=""https://punctumbooks.com/titles/all-except-you/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">all except you</a></em> (punctum books) shows the mind of a master semiotician at work on a cartoonist whose line defined a generation of <em>New Yorker </em>cartoons in the 20th Century. Written in the same “fragments” that Barthes honed in books like <em>A Lover’s Discourse </em>(1977), the text longs for the words to describe the language of Steinberg’s drawings. Ultimately, this longing fails: Steinberg’s “system,” Barthes concludes, is “inexhaustible.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surrendering to this failure is the translator, Joe Milutis, whose commentaries—or “double sessions,” as he calls them (after Derrida)—follow each fragment, unsettling Barthes’s words with theories and ideas of his own. As a vocal proponent of experimental translation in the age of remix and appropriation, Milutis’s rendering of the French is surprisingly straightforward (albeit elegant); however, this conceptual gambit of a running commentary provides an alternative mode of translation that is, in the end, quintessentially Barthesian. This operation begins in the first fragment, where Barthes, unable to identify Steinberg’s characters, says they exist “at the extreme limit of type.” For Milutis, “type” suggests typography—the look of Steinberg’s line—but also&nbsp; “a ‘type’: <em>mec</em> or ‘dude.’ A hookup, anonymous but intimate.” Steinberg’s line—<em>how</em> he draws, not <em>what</em> he draws—is <em>Barthes</em>’s line, his “type,” what “engages his eros.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another word for this line is “idiolect,” a word Barthes borrows from linguistics to apply to Steinberg’s writerly drawing style. Idiolect is Steinberg’s line according to Steinberg, his personal language, the trace of the hand, a particular way of drawing between writing and the scribble. The catch, however—and this is what turns Barthes on, so to speak—is that while Steinberg’s line escapes meaning and “exceeds the letter,” it does so within the boundaries of representational art. This is textbook Barthes given not only his interest in popular cultural forms like comics but also the far-reaches of abstract art. Both the avant-garde and the commercial are sites where, as Barthes details famously, in <em>The Pleasure of the Text </em>(1973), a reader can find “bliss” (the erotic kind) not in a text’s meaning, but in its gaps.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Steinberg’s line is full of gaps, and, therefore, invites the finest bliss. His handwriting—or “like-writing,” as Barthes goes on to say in “ILLEGIBLE”—is compared by Milutis to the French <em>écriture</em>: “script that does not readily accede to meaning,” and thus a key to the stylistic, existential signature of the artist. In Steinberg’s cartoons, his “figure-signs” imitate the world without letting that imitation be useful: The “meaning,” Barthes writes, “becomes both a mad desire (we want to decipher at any cost) and a tireless deception (there is nothing to decipher: one knows it, but is obstinate).” Barthes finds this textual “illegibility” irresistible, likening the act of “reading” Steinberg’s drawings to the experience, naturally, of “tantric sex.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such an allusion might tickle anyone unfamiliar with the language of poststructuralism, but this is where Milutis’s hand in <em>all except you</em> (as translator not just of French, but also of theory) offers a mode of illumination. It turns out, Milutis notes, that this desire for transgressive mimesis—the kind of <em>anti-</em>representation that nonetheless represents <em>something</em>—comes from Freud: “Like Kristeva, who asks ‘is not exactly language our ultimate and inseparable fetish?’ [Barthes] uses Freud’s essay on fetishism to collapse this distinction between sense and nonsense.” Taking this line of thinking further—edging it, perhaps, to some kind of climax—Milutis suggests that Barthes is not so much in love with an idiolect between imitation and abstraction, but in love with the <em>nothing</em> that each traces. “Barthes is not technically a fetishist,” Milutis writes, “because rather than be traumatized by the emptiness of language, he advertises the emptiness… he performs it and seeks it out.”</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>Barthes finds this textual “illegibility” irresistible, likening the act of “reading” Steinberg’s drawings to the experience, naturally, of “tantric sex.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This performance of emptiness—or the narration of the performance of emptiness—goes on ad infinitum. Whether we are interpreting rebuses or modern poetry, we look for empty spaces to fill with meaning, while creating our own text riddled with similar gaps. (For Barthes, this can resemble Zen or Flaubert's <em>Bouvard and Péchuchet;</em> for Steinberg, the blank of the page was as important a part of the composition as was his design). Chorus-like, Milutis responds to this texture of gaps. His sideways glances cruise the text, avoiding easy praise, opting instead for a critical language that levels with Barthes, as in, for example, a fragment on metamorphosis. “Very often,” Barthes writes, “Steinberg pushes metaphor into metamorphosis: a woman is <em>transformed</em> (as in a fairy tale) into an armchair, her body flattened, as if reduced to upholstery.” In response, Milutis: “The armchair reference is not neutral. Steinberg was a notorious womanizer. This fact is dissolved in Barthes’s semiosis, without, however, what he calls the rightist disavowal of these links in pursuit of readerly pleasure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one point, reveling in the metamorphosis of meaning found in etymology, Barthes raises the word “question” from ancient rhetoric (“quaestio”), noting how a question was not just a debatable topic, but also a “‘subject’ (topic) that one needs to ‘treat’ (like a mineral) or ‘beat’ (like a recalcitrant infant).” The use of this active, almost depraved question—as a literal tool more than a philosophic search for answers—is something that Barthes locates in Steinberg’s drawings. “Steinberg,” he writes, “submits a certain number of ‘subjects’ to the ‘question’; he treats them in every way, he renews, varies, and beats them (like a housekeeper beating a carpet to expel the dirt), and he doesn’t relinquish them until they have been exhausted.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The same can be said for the way Milutis treats Barthes, beating the dirt out of his fragments, freshening them for questions about language systems in our own time (note, for example, Milutis’s mention of the “ARE YA WINNING SON” meme in the fragment titled “STUPIDITY”). In this way, Milutis writes on Barthes à la Barthes, “putting into the operation,” as Barthes said in <em>Criticism as language</em>, “his ‘deepest self,’ that is, his preferences, pleasures, resistances, and obsessions.” The effect? <em>all except you</em> is desire <em>all the way down</em>: there, on one side of the bed, we find Barthes on Steinberg, and there, on the other side, we find Milutis on Barthes on Steinberg. The sheets are warm. The universe, hot. And the questions are always somewhere else.</p>

<p><strong>THE COLLECTION OF FANTASTICAL PAINTINGS</strong> in Augustina Wang’s recent exhibition, <em>For Glory and For Love, </em>at Sow &amp; Tailor, offered a refreshing narrative where Asian femmes exist as the heroes of their own world. The exhibition showcased a range of mediums from oil paintings to soft pastels on canvas, organized around a dream-like centerpiece installation of a sword resting amid a dome-shaped mound of flora and fauna. Through her vivid figurative paintings, Wang transplanted the viewer into a universe where women actively challenge traditional gender roles and freely express rage against misogyny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>Lover and Fighter</em>, a woman wraps her arms around a feminine, demonic creature with fangs and long, glistening nails. Both beings have their breasts exposed, and where their bodies meet in the middle, their flesh begins to meld into one another. Rendered in oil and pastel, their seductive and infernal characteristics embody the dualities that occupy Wang’s imaginary world.</p>

<p class=""indented"">In the diptych <em>Poet, </em>an angelic poet sits in a dreamlike meadow, writing. She simultaneously watches a young woman to her left submerge the head of another into a body of water. As a survivor of assault, Wang has firsthand experience with being a victim and a bystander. In this scene, she draws from her own experiences while noting the complex and conflicting processes of healing and seeking justice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The recurring motif of the sword, along with bow and arrows and the female heroine dressed as a knight in shining armor, brought to mind a mix of a modern heroine princess fairytale. Wang adopted these visuals from online spaces like video games and fanfiction, where female characters exist beyond the misogyny and sexism of our daily lives. Wang’s feminine characters take on the guise of warriors with metal swords as an empowering symbol, as they physically take up space to challenge the status quo.</p>

2262,"Letter to a Brazilian Friend","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dear friend,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Can I even call you that? I did once, and I would like to do so again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you remember our friendship as I do? Two children aloof within the fences of Catholic school in suburban Rio. A school which, despite the nuns and their ghostly scapula, let us think as we pleased; prayers were optional, and we were only forced to sing the anthem on Wednesday mornings. True, class consisted of hurried copying and recitation. And I was often the last one to leave. But every time I was rewarded by the sight of your hickory curls and soft eyes waiting for me outside the classroom door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our time together was brief, and in less than a year I would leave Brazil again. Our last day together was just like any other. (Perhaps you saw it differently.) I imagined I would write you letters, or message you online. We never did. I hold at least half of the blame. What strikes me now was the warmth of our last embrace. The nuns were on their way to the chapel, kicking up terracotta dust in the afternoon sun. Children filed onto their respective buses. We held each other for a while. I felt your heart through my chest. It beat so freely. I don’t recall what we said in that last moment. The poet in me hopes we said nothing. I stepped onto my bus and you onto yours. You waved at me through the window and then the buses parted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought of you as I flew over the Atlantic and I still thought of you in the capricious climate of London. But every day the tangible you became ever more consigned to a childhood memory. And days passed, first slowly, then quickly. But for the occasional message online, I eventually did not think of you at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was twenty-two when I last wrote to you. I am not sure if anyone is the same when they go to bed and when they awake. How dissimilar you had become to the person I held in my memory. I wonder if a more active influence on my part would have made you see things as I do. I don’t like didactic moralizing, but in your case I can’t help but see the result of my indifference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you know, the election of that vile man took me by surprise. I used to enjoy the voice of my relatives’ crackle through the phone. We used to speak of meaningful things: the color of the pool my grandfather loved to clean, the joy of a cold glass of water on a warm summer’s day, the imminent engagement of a distant second cousin. Then, one day, all they could speak of was him. It would have been fine if the candidate was not the same inarticulate criminal you also chose to vote for. To praise a man who openly called for torture and executions! From then on my relatives' voices seemed so distant. The thought that people who loved me could also love him tainted my love for them in return.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was in the last semester of my bachelor’s degree. I spent my days locked up in my room with 15th century court documents. Hidden among family feuds and serfs were traces of interest rates in London. That violent medieval town became a welcome image; more familiar than the Brazil that now showed itself to me. I thought back to the dictatorship and all of the artists forced to leave for Europe. With a beast in power and a general as vice-president the specter of a coup seemed unavoidable. In a bout of romanticism, I imagined myself an exile, unable to return to Rio. A romantic yet despairing thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On his inauguration I found myself in Spain. I ate twelve grapes at the strike of midnight in Plaza de la Constitución. Squeezed up against a Victoria’s Secret store I waited for fireworks that never came. I walked down the quay and fantasized about a civil war. The fight for common decency in a country the size of a continent charmed me. I could see how our side would continue flying the republican flag, green in all of its splendor, open and equal before all. Our trenches would be the melting pot of Brazil, strengthened by volunteers from every nation in the world. Within range of our guns I expected to see only men with screeching voices sermonizing imported ideologies ill-suited to their amalgamated skin tones. As anyone who imagines war does, I assumed I would survive the ordeal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you know my position already. I exhaust you. I reached out to you four years ago in hope of finding a friend to share the pain of that tormentuos moment. When your answer came it broke me. Not because I loved you still—by then you were a stranger. But because it was unfathomable how your soft heart had reached such violent conclusions. Your patience had curdled to irritation. Your carefree heartbeat, stiff. Your love, rancid. How could you choose him, a man who openly called for dictatorship and death, over any other candidate?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once, we had laughed in the shade of the school canteen, but you did not find my comment about the president being a “criminal turtle” very amusing. (Surely you must see he looks like a turtle?) It seems the walls of time were too thick. Your response was brutish. “The only turtle is you for being stuck in the past—and moreover a criminal for abandoning your nation.” I can’t deny that made me laugh. Not only did you deny my kindness, but in so doing denied our common past. You attacked me for condoning corruption, my lack of patriotism, and my subordination to naïve ideals. You told me that I had no right to “opine distanced from events” as I was. You attached a photograph of yourself wearing the yellow jersey of the national football team. Beneath the smile and the scars of time I saw the ghost of my old friend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I left your letter on my desk and went for a walk in Lincoln's Inn Fields. I sat on a bench under a plane tree. I tried to think of a response. I tried not to think of you at all. There were sudden turbulent bursts of wind in the spring air. It was cold. I needed a drink. On my way out of the park I saw a murder of crows. I watched them until I noticed the corpse they were munching on. A pigeon and its guts lay sprawled on the grass. Just twenty paces down a band of pigeons shifted about aimlessly behind a bush. Some of us spend a tremendous amount of energy merely trying to get by. The pandemic undoubtedly made it all even worse. Silence felt best. If not for you, then for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that he is gone I felt I could send you my answer. The way that you actively chose to ruin the very thing you thought you were defending caused me immense pain. You defended Brazil by attacking democracy, progress, order—even carnival. I recall a growing respect for Brazil among acquaintances—until your man won the election. With your lot in charge I found myself forced to apologize. Every time I told someone I was Brazilian I had to clarify my vote, to explain that Brazil was not just poverty, even if it was on the rise again. It felt like going back twenty years, to the days when people knew only of football and favelas. For the first time I was ashamed to be Brazilian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And the flag—why is it that you are obsessed with the flag? In Europe I have a hard time explaining such patriotism. Inequalities exist, I admit, but the beauty of the new world is the very lack of a defining ethnic identity—not everywhere perhaps, but at the very least in Brazil. A woman born and raised in a favela in Recife is as much a Brazilian as the Congolese-born man working at the kiosk in Rio. The Congolese part shouldn’t even be relevant if the man calls himself Brazilian. A new Rome of sorts. But now, thanks to you, reluctance fills the air. I admit I wonder if you even consider me Brazilian. But then I wonder what you consider Brazilian at all. I doubt you have given any of your ideas much thought when you let influencers do the thinking for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite my lack of interest in sport, the feeling of being united with 220 million people is a powerful drug—especially when the odds are so favorable. I sense that you and I love football and the flag differently. You love it as a symbol of power. You imagine men and women like yourself making their way to the top. You love the World Cup because you want to feel invincible. You naively imagine yourself becoming an oligarch. You would kill others in the belief that it would make you safe. I love Brazil too much to be a nationalist. I don't want any greatness for it, particularly a greatness born of blood and falsehood. I want to keep it alive by keeping justice alive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rumor has it you still hold on to your new ways. The truth is, I found one of your online profiles. One of your posts told people to vote for him again. After four disastrous years you still wanted him. Why? You have seen the results of his tenure. You see the result of men like him in Ukraine now. I am sure his many Internet-Goebbels tell you otherwise. If you fear that your personality is too tied up in this to abandon it, fear not. We all make such mistakes. Know that if anything I will respect you more for putting your errors behind you. If, however, you truly believe yourself in the right, even now, I have little comfort to offer. All I can see is a path toward destruction. Look at the mimicry you attempted on January 8th. If you do not destroy yourself, you will destroy the very things you proclaim to love. You already have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My tone is sure to elicit no friendly response from you. As I have said, I would like to call you friend. I have told you what I think. It is now up to you to decide whether to embrace me in both word and in action.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">The Enlightenment of Katzuo Nakamatsu<br>
by Augusto Higa Oshiro, transl. by Jennifer Shyue<br>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The end of the 19th century saw Japanese immigrants</strong> traveling en masse to Peru. Initially, they went to work in mines and on sugar plantations, but many established themselves in middle class working sectors. As the 20th century began, Peru’s Japanese community had grown to include lawyers, business owners, and respected blue collar workers. But the start of the Second World War saw a strong anti-Japanese sentiment spread across Peru, which reached its peak following the Pearl Harbor attack. Japanese businesses and schools were burnt to the ground as the United States ordered the arrest of Japanese citizens in a host of Latin American countries. Many arrestees were deported to internment camps in the US.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Augusto Higa Oshiro, the son of immigrants from Okinawa, grew up in the working class district of La Victoria, Lima in the 1950s and ‘60s. Keen to immortalize the markets and streets that punctuated his childhood, he aligned himself with the Grupo Narración, who set out to represent marginalized communities through working class Lima. <a href=""https://archipelagobooks.org/book/the-enlightenment-of-katzuo-nakamatsu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><em>The Enlightenment of Katzuo Nakamatsu</em> (<em>La iluminación de Katzuo Nakamatsu</em>)</a>, originally published in Spanish in 2008 and now available in an English translation by Jennifer Shyue, addresses the racial fracturing that the Nisei (second generation Japanese immigrants) of Peru suffered. The eponymous protagonist is a product of his Japanese heritage, though his ancestry is more often grounds for shame and humiliation rather than pride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The novel opens with a 58-year-old Nakamatsu suddenly and unexpectedly overcome by a fatalism about his end of days, his “untimely lot [which] slid[e]s him to the brink of suicide.” He puts his passing up against the “larger cosmic equilibrium” and decides that his only recourse is to succumb to it. Soon he is “unceremoniously” let go from his professorship at an unnamed university “because of his age.” Without any further responsibilities, Nakamatsu drifts away from any practical concerns toward his death. He has some personal projects—a study of Peruvian Metaphysical poet Martín Adán, and a biographical recounting of Japanese families in Peru—but these remain incomplete on account of his laziness. With his ambitions drained, Nakamatsu plans his suicide and spirals into madness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A product of his ancestor’s diaspora, Nakamatsu finds himself fractured between two worlds. His Japanese self—a considerable chunk of his cultural makeup—is entrenched. However, this facet of his identity is more often than not the root of his self-hatred; his inability to get private feelings across, his fatalism are explained away as mere “ancestral sentiment[s].” His problems are inherently Japanese, he believes, and heightened by his Nisei status. At the same time, he feels isolated from the rest of the Japanese community in Lima. Nakamatsu is disposed to “the rigour of ideas and the search for a voice of his own,” values he believes are diametrically opposed to those of his old friends and siblings. In this liminal state between self-hatred and misanthropy, Nakamatsu is left without anyone to turn to, and can only look upon himself with shame. His total resignation in the face of death comes as no surprise, given his circumstance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nakamatsu reminds me of Clarice Lispector’s Lóri (<em>An Apprenticeship</em>): both live away from home, and their emotional response to this distance fills them with self-hatred, as well as a metaphysical angst; for a person without a country, the base act of being becomes an intricate task, something that one is conscious of, something that appears teachable. Both characters are alienated from the social worlds they are in, and misinterpret their inability to integrate by neurotically positing intricate laws and practices of living that simply escape them, as if living were a skill that required book learning and muscle memory. Lóri fears it is her lot in life to be “cosmically different” and uninvolved in life. Both allow their neuroticisms to make them passengers in life. Or, as Higa Oshiro puts it himself: “raving at the margins, walled off from the world, majestic and destitute.” They are caught between worlds, without a tangible entry point to either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the story progresses, Nakamatsu’s self begins to unravel as he embraces an ascetic approach to his demise. The story distances itself from his perspective, emphasizing this self-abnegation; what appeared to be an omniscient third person narrator pulls the curtain back, revealing an old colleague simply reporting on his friend’s worsening condition. Additionally, Nakamatsu starts to experience auditory hallucinations, voices which at times assert themselves over our protagonist. His stream of consciousness takes a backseat as various Issei (first generation immigrants from Japan) take center stage. At times, Nakamatsu is reduced to no more than a vessel through which these ghosts recount.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Descending into madness, Nakamatsu begins dressing as one of his father’s old friends, Etsuko Untén. For Nakamatsu, Untén exists solely through dubious stories from his childhood, as well as a few old photographs (Untén had been held up as a hero during the Second World War, proudly embracing his Japanese heritage in the face of the violent discrimination the Japanese were facing in the Americas). Nakamatsu assembles an outfit based on Untén’s in an old photo: gray felt hat, dark canvas coat, tortoiseshell glasses, blue ties with pinstripes, narrow-legged trousers, and a wooden cane with reinforced handle. In his new threads, Nakamatsu also believes himself to resemble—embody, perhaps—his beloved Martin Adán. Literally and metaphorically reborn, we follow Nakamatsu’s aimless wanderings around working class neighborhoods in Lima, brushing shoulders with thugs and prostitutes. In contrast to his total passive acceptance in the face of death, this simple wardrobe change is significant. Is this Nakamatsu holding up two fingers to fate? If he is pushed toward his own death by this stoic ancestral resignation, why not escape himself in the process, amorphous and proud? Better yet, mightn’t he form a <em>true</em> self on the way out?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lines can be drawn between Nakamatsu’s mimicry of his heroes and the plight of Japanese citizens in Peru. In Higa Oshiro’s own case, Japanese-Peruvians were often met with hatred on both sides (in 1990, when Oshiro returned to Japan, he experienced discrimination for being a foreigner). Thus, they lack the privilege to build a sense of self around the foundations of nationality: Nakamatsu is left to fend for himself, ultimately constructing a final identity that may ostensibly seem like simple imitation. Isolated, he sees Etsuko as emblematic of degrees of bravery that feel unattainable to himself. How might he express these feelings, if he feels that his ancestral roots don’t allow for such characters? Similarly, those feelings inspired in him by Martín Adán are unshareable; metaphysical thinking is an inherently lonely, abstract pursuit, forever butting heads with the practical world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Does Etsuko reveal to Nakamatsu untrodden elements within himself? It might seem there is nothing authentic about this mimicry; Nakamatsu is only playing the role of somebody else to get away from his self-hatred. I, however, see this final choice, in contrast to his total resignation, as revealing and heroic: On his way out, Nakamatsu takes the chance to reinvent his sense of self, one that isn’t rooted in shame. A man without a country, he is unable to turn to his nations to pull a sense of self together. On his way out, Nakamatsu finds a sense of belonging in a sphere that is incapable of ostracization: fiction.</p>

<p><strong>IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PLACE HENRI MATISSE'S ART</strong> in the many formulations of Modernism that emphasize angles and speed, confrontation and fragmentation, and the significance of second meanings. Picasso all but poked viewers in the eye at the pinnacle of his abstract portraiture, while Magritte spelled it out that his pipe was not, in fact, a pipe and Duchamp’s found objects put provocation on a pedestal. But what does Matisse’s <em>La Blouse roumaine </em>(1940) ask of us other than to look and linger? Even the early Fauvist jolt of <em>Open Window, Collioure</em> (1905) is delivered with sunshine, flowers, and a seafront view.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In <em>Notes of a Painter </em>from 1908, Matisse described his evolution beyond the “delicate sensations” of Impressionist painters as a quest “to obtain greater stability.” Enduring an existence of familial and professional conflict in an era that variably sought and was subjected to monumental disruptions in every facet of life, Matisse practiced a modernism that could be conceived of as a search for solid ground. A recent exhibition at the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris focused on that vigorous search, specifically in the 1930s when the painter’s output reached new peaks of inscrutable charm and unflagging experimentation in the wake of artistic and personal strife. The purity of expression he ultimately achieved in his greatest paintings from this tumultuous period foreshadow the process and success of his constellation-like cut-outs starting in the mid-1940s, when ailing health rendered him immobile. Both cases suggest a Matissian modernism that aims not to reflect an unstable, industrialized world, but to persevere through an unfailing commitment to creative expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the same, by the end of the 1920s, Matisse had lost the desire to paint. He wrote that he “had pretty well come to the end” of painting recumbent women and domestic interiors after more than a decade at work in Nice (where this show has now moved to). In March of 1929, while a flurry of retrospectives were being planned for him around the world, he told his wife Amélie that his “painting is going nowhere.” On the other hand, he noted that his lithographs “flow of their own accord.” But where were they flowing? Many were ending up in a new magazine called <em>Cahiers d’art</em>, and a thread of the exhibition documents how its founding in 1926 and immediate support of Matisse helped (re)introduce his early fauvist and cubist-inspired paintings, alongside more recent ones, to an art world that had seemingly tired of his work before he did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>The tension Matisse identified between an impressionist’s light and frenzied canvas, representing “only one moment of existence,” and his struggle to elucidate, as he put it, his subject's ""essential character"" underlies the masterworks displayed at l’Orangerie.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Reproductions, particularly of the Nice odalisques, lithograph commissions, and articles abounded in <em>Cahiers d’art</em>, helping prompt monographic exhibitions in 1930 and 1931. However, as his biographer Hilary Spurling describes, “Matisse dreaded the public tributes, which he correctly predicted would deplore his latest work” and “consign his achievements firmly to the past.” In February 1930, as curators were beginning to mount major shows in Berlin, New York, and Basel and his wife’s health was at a low point, the 61-year-old artist left France for Tahiti by way of America, a dramatic break to set up the “pivotal 1930s” (as the show is subtitled) that followed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Matisse set out for a new quality of light to replace the Mediterranean sunshine that had kept him on the Cote d’Azur for so long. What he found in Tahiti, he wrote, was a light so “ferociously beautiful,” “alarming” even, that by noontime, he was frightened of it. This wounded response—they were only sunny days, after all—suggests just how vulnerable he was amid his personal and creative crises. He traveled without brushes, canvas or easel, calling himself a painter with “no ideas whatever,” capable of “no pictorial reaction” to his environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Matisse considered the trip a bust. “Accomplished absolutely nothing except bad photos,” he told Pierre Bonnard. However, this experience chimes with his willingness in 1908 to stand in opposition to the “fleeting impressions” painted by the likes of Monet and Alfred Sisley, two committed plein-air men who might have had a field day in Papeete. Writing about Matisse’s trip in the essay “I’m No Traveler,” Yve-Alain Bois put it simply: “He was not an impressionist… it was as a stimulant that he needed a change of light, not in order to attempt rendering it per se.” The tension Matisse identified between an impressionist’s light and frenzied canvas, representing “only one moment of existence,” and his struggle to elucidate, as he put it, his subject's ""essential character"" underlies the masterworks displayed at l’Orangerie.</p>

<p class=""indented"">The centerpieces of the show are <em>Large Reclining Nude</em> (1935), on loan from Baltimore’s rich collection of his 1930s work, and <em>Woman in Blue</em> (1937), from Philadelphia, where the exhibition was first mounted. Like many of his paintings from the period—<em>Woman with a Scarf </em>(1936), <em>La Musique </em>(1939)<em>, Saxifrages et citrons </em>(1943)—these two make use of a gridded background. Whether playing the part of wallpaper, flooring, or bedsheet, this has the effect of casting its subject against a plotted plane like the parabolic output of a math equation. It’s a stroke of bravado that gives the paintings a visible sense of analytical rigor. Likewise the documentary process Matisse employed simultaneously of photographing every stage of the painting’s completion, repeatedly tweaking the posture and surroundings of his subject on the canvas. The process photos, included in the exhibit, reveal that Matisse only added the striking blueprint-like background of <em>Large Reclining Nude</em> after several iterations; similarly, in <em>Woman in Blue</em>, a naturalist interior reminiscent of his placid Riviera portraits gave way to a brain-teasing layering of three differently patterned surfaces.</p>

<p class=""indented"">A camera also found its way into the studios of Picasso and Alberto Giacometti in the 1930s, but Dora Maar’s photos of <em>Guernica </em>in train and Marc Vaux’s of the Swiss sculptor at work were commissioned by <em>Cahiers d’art</em> as reportage for its readership. Matisse said he took copious photos for himself to make sure he wasn’t moving backwards. Spurling notes that only months before starting on <em>Large Reclining Nude</em>, he told his son he “still had no clear idea of where he was heading.” Later in 1939, talking about working with models, he told an interviewer he was interested less “in the representation of their bodies, but often rather in the lines or the special values distributed over the whole canvas or paper.” Matisse almost seems to have reverted to a system of latitude and longitude to navigate himself out of years of profound creative frustration and chart a refreshed perspective on the painted female figure.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The several stages of<em> Woman in Blue</em> see her bolt upright from a forlorn sideways slouch; Matisse refined her hypnotic, arresting pose as he added the grids behind her. The interior centers its totemic occupant, whose left arm now gestures to her head with one pointed finger, perhaps hinting at the psychic struggles of the artist, or just reminding us to think. Thanks to a process which yielded the assertive, talismanic outcome of <em>Woman in Blue</em>, Matisse countered the floatiness of impressionism; yet while he’d written that he was willing to “risk losing charm” to do so, her enigmatic quality among frills and flowers only enhanced it.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Reaching something of a cruising altitude in 1940, and working “with a certain liberty, knowing that my works are no longer awaited,” Matisse painted a confident stability into the likes of <em>La Blouse roumaine,</em> <em>Interior with an Etruscan Vase </em>(1940), and <em>Dancer Resting </em>(1940), whose color block floor could almost be a sly reference to his abstract vision of Notre Dame from 1914. That these works—some completed in days—echoed but no longer required the careful analytical construction of <em>Woman in Blue</em> suggests that Matisse found a brief respite from the artistic and familial turmoil that had colored his career to that point. When he dedicated himself fully to producing paper cut-outs in 1945, he wrote that his only direction in painting would be to ""go back over the same ground."" Chronologically, this is his ultimate phase of painting, a fact in harmony with the unbothered, self-assured figures he depicts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet Matisse’s children Pierre and Marguerite would criticize most of what he produced in this last sustained effort at the easel. Along with new health scares and the dissolution of Marguerite’s marriage and his own to Amélie in July 1939, Matisse found himself thrown back&nbsp;into a deep emotional crisis as the Second World War broke out, which scattered his family across France and beyond. A solitary bit of wall text at the close of the exhibit quotes Matisse in 1940 saying that he was pursuing work ""to forget the tragic times we are all experiencing.” Marguerite was arrested in May 1944 for participating in the Resistance and was being deported by train to a death camp in Germany when an air raid allowed her to escape. As Laurence Bertrand Dorleac describes in his essay “Ignoring History,” Matisse wrote in letters that he was left ""completely crushed"" by his daughter’s experience, which included being repeatedly beaten and nearly drowned by German officers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Writing to his son months after France was liberated, the 76-year-old expressed his view that work was “the greatest human pleasure” and maintained the “youthfulness of mind into extreme old age.” Yet work was never a simple distraction—satisfaction required a sense of progress: “Things must always be judged by the goal they aim at.” Above all, Matisse stressed in 1935, “I put myself into everything I do…I am not trying to protect myself.” These words, from an ageing man whose life and work had long been defined by pain and doubt, express the terms of a Matissian modernism that painstakingly transformed the anxiety of existence into confident expressions of beauty—never more so than in the decade on display here.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Luis Burgos is a New York-based artist whose work often takes the form of photobooks and photo essays that retell historical liberation struggles as contemporary stories. Moses in the City focuses on Exodus, the Biblical story of the enslavement and eventual liberation of the Jews in Egypt. We spoke in February 2023 and our conversation was condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>HANNAH FAGIN: </strong>Tell us a bit about your practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>LUIS BURGOS:</strong> My photography and writing are oriented around capturing memory. Throughout my life, images and visual texts have conjured up specific moments in time for me. I use these mediums to create a narrative for myself so I can reflect, particularly on things that have brought me joy and healing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Why did you decide to tell the story of Exodus as a photo essay in <em>Moses in the City</em>? What about the story resonated with you and made you want to retell the story in this form?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the protest movement picked up in 2020, I saw a sign that said “end 400 years of oppression.” I remembered that in the Exodus story, the Israelites were in the “narrow place” for 430 years. I thought, do we have 30 years left of this? That was the catalyst for me coming back to this story and reworking it to incorporate what I experience to be the modern day Exodus story and how I’m able to intersect my Black identity and my Jewish identity around this narrative of freedom and slavery.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Can you share more about the working process on this project and who you collaborated with?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started by rereading the beginning of Exodus and used that to create a shot list of what images I needed to tell the story. The cast is mostly my friends. We met up one day in November to shoot the book and it turned out to be the best day for foliage so it felt like a magical time in Central Park. Once I had the images, I ordered them into a visual photo story. From there, I added and wrote texts that helped the story flow and played with the images.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">The book is an art object, but it’s also a Haggadah, the Jewish text read at a Passover Seder that tells the story of Exodus. How do you hope people will use the book?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My hope is that people will use it as a fully functional Haggadah at their Seders. I wanted to make a photobook that people would be drawn to year after year, not just for the imagery. I want it to have food stains and wine stains. I want it to be lived in and used. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hosted a Seder around the release of Moses in the City. It was a Jews of color Seder I coordinated with <a href=""https://www.labshul.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lab/Shul</a>, an artist-centered Jewish community in NYC, and I invited four Jews of color organizations to join me. It felt really important to give them creative freedom and allow them to do whatever had meaning to them. As a Jew of color coming into predominantly white spaces, I found that people would only reach out to us during Black history month or Juneteenth and it was less of an invitation to share and more of an ask to please appear and be present. It felt really tokenizing. So this Seder was profound for me, it was For Us, By Us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Seder was really beautiful and intimate. We projected images from the book as we went through the ritual. There was live music. It was interfaith, so there was a priest and a Zen master who were also there. The space felt integrated across many identities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">How did you translate the story of Exodus to New York City? I specifically loved how you end the photobook with an image taken at the site of Seneca Village, the former site of a free, Black, land-owning community from the 1820s until 1857, when the city destroyed the village to construct Central Park. How do you connect these sites of liberation struggles throughout history?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was rooted in the fact that every generation is tasked with making the story of Exodus their own and it’s about the ways in which I’m currently in a “narrow place” and what it would look like to be in a liberated place. New York was a great character for that idea because it really does embody narrowness and liberation. It’s a small island and we’re very packed in. It can also feel narrow in the ways in which we experience hardship here. It is built for the wealthy and it prioritizes their needs. At the same time it’s liberated. We can be whoever we are. We can find our enclaves and our safe spaces in a way you can’t necessarily do with ease outside of the city. I grew up in New York and I left it for 5 years in my mid-twenties. When I came back, I realized it’s both Egypt and the promised land.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seneca Village was a very intentional choice. At the end of Exodus, they’re basically told “you’re going to make it to this promised land,” but there are already people there. My understanding of why we lose the land of Israel is that we don’t go into it acknowledging that we came from a narrow place. Once we’re in a position of power, we replicate the things that were done to us. We ostracize the other, kill the other, push the other out. Seneca Village was a reminder of that, of the fact that this land, Central Park, may look really beautiful but underneath it there is pain. The Seneca Village image is a reminder for people not to repeat the mistakes of the past, to not replicate these systems of oppression and displacement, but rather to come in and be good neighbors. What does it mean to integrate rather than assimilate or displace?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">This is also making me think of how you’re queering this very ancient story. For example, you have the “wise child” holding a copy of <em>Torah Queeries</em> in one of the photo sequences. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Queerness is very ancient and our stories are not only erased, but they’re also dismissed and disregarded. In my opinion, there are many examples of queerness in the <em>Tanakh</em>, the Hebrew bible. It felt like an opportunity to queer the story, but not make queerness central to the story. As queer people, our queerness is sometimes centralized, but often because people are making us defend it. When we’re able to just be amongst ourselves or just be ourselves, it’s not central to the story. It’s just who we are. I thought it was a great opportunity to make Moses a queer character.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Why are you drawn to photography and writing in your artistic practice? How do they relate for you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially, I was drawn to painting and sculpture. But they were time consuming. With photography, I could create my own painting. That’s why I went back to shooting film. Digital felt too real and like too much information, but film has this dream-like quality that paintings have. It’s realistic enough that you know what you’re looking at, but it’s also playful enough that it feels like a story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I read, I see things in my head. I picture the scene, the images, the people. It made me realize that I have a way of taking text and turning it into an image or vice versa. My writing tends to be very visual and sensory. These two mediums allowed me to express my memory. Adding a few lines of text to an image allows the story to grow.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Are there any projects you’re dreaming about at the moment? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m working on two projects. I’m continuing my memoir. I’ve gone through some very traumatic things in my life. What I want to share, rather than “trauma porn,” is the ways in which I’ve healed from those traumas, which are very happy memories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next year I’m hoping to do a photo essay called Daddy Issues about the relationship between Abraham and Isaac after Abraham tries to kill Isaac. I’m estranged from my dad and I find that the most frustrating aspect, in addition to having to accept this difficult relationship, is that complete strangers will say to me, “but they’re your parents.” There are things people can do where I will love them from a distance but I will no longer give them access to me. People don’t seem to ask what a parent could do to make their child never want to see them again. The answers to that question are as disturbing as it was for Abraham when G-d asked him to sacrifice his son Isaac.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I reread that story, I noticed they don’t mention Isaac after he survives. In my mind, Isaac doesn’t speak to Abraham again until he leaves. I imagine he’s like, “I don’t want to talk to you anymore, you tried to kill me. I can forgive you, I can move on with my life, but that doesn’t mean I’m ever going to feel safe around you again.” I’m also looking forward to queering that narrative up because there’s definitely some BDSM vibes there. I mean Abraham bounds Isaac and he doesn’t even protest. Clearly, he’s like “Yes, Daddy, tie me up.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What role does community play in your life and in your artistic practice?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Community is extremely important for me, especially as marginalized people. I think of Black community first. My family immigrated here from the Dominican Republic. I’m the first generation to be born and raised in New York. What I found is that Black people in my community were the ones that said, “You’re one of us. Here’s what you need to know.” For example, when I was in fourth grade, I got into a charter school that I would have to take a public bus to. My mom said no because of this. My best friend’s mom came to my mom’s salon and said to her that this was a really good opportunity for me. That was the first time I really acknowledged and noticed Black community because this woman didn’t owe me anything and she came to my mom’s work and was like, this is for your son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of my Jewish community, I find it’s really tight knit. Part of that is how old it is. We’ve been in community for so long, whereas in the Black community, historically, we’ve been discouraged and flat out impeded from creating community; we have been actively attacked and disassembled. Our leaders have been targeted and sometimes killed. Coming into Judaism was interesting because I could take all of that history of oppression and apply that knowledge and wisdom to my Black community. For example, I really encourage fellow Black people to rest. It’s anti-capitalist and a small form of reparations. Any time a white person asks me to work harder, I tell them, “I’m tired, Massa,” and that usually makes them so uncomfortable they leave me alone. Or if they ask me to do emotional labor for them, I tell them, “I am not your Mammy.” These approaches disarm them and make them stop long enough to realize they’re asking me for an inappropriate amount of labor. It makes them uncomfortable, but I need white people to check that instinct because I have given what I can give and if you ask for more, it’s your ancestors talking, do it yourself. Within Judaism, rest is a central concept—it’s all of Shabbat. I love that we as Jews get to define rest. For me, it’s not checking work emails and doing whatever feels restorative. Black and Jewish community has been central to my healing, feeling of safety, and support.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">V. Vale, the founder and owner of Search &amp; Destroy and RE/Search Publications is both an elusive and ever-present legendary figure in San Francisco’s cultural life. He can be found in front of Vesuvio’s Café and City Lights Bookstore in North Beach selling his Punk art zines, books, music and photos on weekends and is a regular at book fairs and international Punk history gatherings. I like to meet Vale at the Anne Bremer Memorial Library at SFAI and it was there we worked together on Bruce Conner: The Afternoon Interviews (2016).
<br>
<br>
When the editors of Dispatches approached me to facilitate an interview between them and Vale, I explained that this sort of interview would not be organized through digital comms in the way they would be accustomed to. First, I would have to arrange a meet-up by calling Vale on the phone, not by text or email. Second, they would have to meet Vale at his house and studio and find his doorbell. Third, I could not guarantee that the interview could be recorded or what analogue devices would be used for text. The following is an interview that took place in person with Vale in his North Beach neighborhood. (It has been edited and condensed for clarity.) It’s fun to play go-between for Vale: you never know what adventure he will lead you on and what rare book you might discover.
<br>
—Natasha Boas: San Francisco, January 2022</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>V. (“Valhalla”) Vale—the writer, editor, publisher, broadcaster, interviewer, legendary chronicler of underground scenes, and self- credentialed cultural anthropologist—was born in a Japanese internment camp near Jerome, Arkansas in 1944, the son of the socialist activist and wartime conscientious objector Kiyoshi Hamanaka, who later pursued a career as the actor Conrad Yama, and Mary Takaoka, a former vaudeville performer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vale graduated from UC Berkeley in 1966, with “a worthless degree in English literature,” and immediately moved to the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco in time for what he insists was the real Summer of Love (as opposed to the media-heralded, flowers-in-your-hair happening of 1967). In Haight Street’s The Psychedelic Shop he found a poster recruiting members for the group which became Blue Cheer, and played keyboards with the band until it contracted to a trio July 15, 1967. That same day he moved to North Beach, where he has been ever since.</p>

<p>In 1977 Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg each donated $100 when Vale started <em>Search &amp; Destroy</em>, his pioneer zine covering punk rock in the Bay from its Mabuhay Gardens days, “pre-Internet, pre- fax.” Punk’s disruptions conjured echoes of Dada and Situationism, and inspired a more ambitious project, <em>RE/Search</em>. He learned printing and started a typesetting business, which, to his surprise, gave him a living, and enabled him to print magazines and books on par with the big publishing houses. <em>RE/Search </em>deepened and extended Vale’s cultural forays: urban primitivism, pranks, industrial culture, displaying what Henry Rollins calls “Anger and curiosity.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vale believes art is collective, and it follows that the list of his subjects, sponsors, collaborators, etc., is encyclopedic, beginning with Kathy Acker and ends not until he finds the latest of the “1000 interesting people on this planet that I refer to as primary source thinkers.” William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard have been touchstone authors, and Bruce Sterling a staunch supporter. Comparisons have been made to Andy Warhol and Studs Terkel.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vale’s most consistent collaborator is his wife, Marian Wallace; a 12-track digital album, in which he plays the spinet piano, <em>Lockdown Lullabies</em>, was released in 2020 and is available at <a href=""https://researchpubs.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">https://researchpubs.bandcamp.com/</a>.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM:</strong> What is your vision of San Francisco and how has it changed?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>V. VALE:</strong> What is my vision of San Francisco? It used to be a major cultural hub in my book. I went to New York and I was too intimidated to move there. And it was too dark and the weather is terrible most of the time. But San Francisco has the best climate in the world: Mediterranean. Also, the best topography because of the Seven Hills. There’s all this variety of views. We’re also right next to the ocean. We even have a lake by SF State University. We also have the hottest desert. You can go skiing in a one-day drive. We have access to the most amazing nature in the world: the Redwoods.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">So for you it’s about the environment and nature?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that’s the foundational part. To me the basics are the climate, the geography, the topography but... I also think we have some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, just walking around—especially North Beach. I read that North Beach was built and planned by city planners and architects from Genoa, Italy (another port city) so it’s literally like being in “Little Italy.” And Coit Tower is a magical spot—it’s so beautiful and the views are great. When I moved here I was paying rent like $20 and $25 a month for a room. And I thought it would always stay that way. I didn’t realize the world would be destroyed by real estate speculation. For every artist in the world the hardest challenge they face every month is: How do I raise next month’s high rent? In San Francisco, or any major city—</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Do you think that would attract more creatives here?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would help. In a way I’m glad that covid happened because I read that a hundred thousand “techies” moved out. I got an apartment in 1970, a small, four-room apartment two blocks away and the owner was a 95-year-old Italian man who made his living shining shoes. But he had managed to buy a three-story building with five apartments and a basement. My rent was $90 a month.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, it was affordable, and he said, “I like to give my fellow man a break.” Do you think any other realtor in the world has that attitude? Hell no. So I say real estate is ruining the world. The artificially high prices have nothing to do with helping humans survive on planet Earth. The most basic thing we need is the roof over our heads... the rents are way too high. Both small businesses and humans can’t afford the rent. That is the root of all evil: RENT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. We have another new aphorism!</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Well that leads to a question about money. How can artists avoid succumbing to conventional wisdom and self-censorship, endeavors that make them conform to financial realities?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, I guess you can cut your brain in half and one half can produce commercial work that’s blatantly commercial. The other half can create any art idea you have where you don’t give a damn if it’s commercial or not. But I think one needs to do something to benefit “society.” I think the favorite time of my life was when I ran a home computer-typesetting business and rented an outside office. My business did so well that I was shocked, and it probably didn’t do THAT well; it’s just that I was finally getting a middle-class income. I grew up on welfare. My mother was mentally ill. I was lucky to get us AFDC (aid for financially-dependent children). I joked that I supported my mother because she couldn’t hold down a job. My mother was smart, she moved us to some tiny town in Riverside County where all the rents were really cheap and everything was cheap. Anyway, artists, to survive now, they have to kind of bunch up in apartments. They gotta share apartments. They gotta keep the rent down so they can afford to buy art supplies.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Tell us a bit about your influences.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Not Bruce Conner?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, he was an anti-role model: Whatever he did, don’t do it! Now, the Dialogues with Duchamp by Pierre Cabanne has got to be one of the most important books ever put on paper. It’s not written, it’s a real conversation like we’re having. And Duchamp is just pulling out these little nuggets—principles, really—to live by; that’s what we really want. We want causes, we want principles, we don’t want just sound-bites!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the most important thing Duchamp said: “Never repeat, despite the encores.” That’s where so many people get derailed; I mean artists who are alive when they actually get some commercial success (which is very rare). So many of these artists just start imitating their younger selves. And if you’re living and dynamic and meeting people and having conversations and speculating and having global cultural input, then you might get some new, new ideas. People always say there’s nothing new under the sun, but there’s new-ish things under the sun!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wouldn’t get too hung up on: “Am I really being original 100%—is it only 90% or 80% or 70%?” I wouldn’t go granular on that. But, the shower is a great time—or as soon as you wake up—to come up with ideas and then at least write ’em in a notebook. Yeah, the notebook is the key part of living, because you record your ideas. You will wake up with ideas; you will get ideas in the shower; you will get ideas sitting on the porcelain throne.</p>

<p>You know, I ask that question almost every day because I’m hoping to find one! Maybe the “counter-culture” now is atomized: a bunch of tiny little groups like you guys. I went to the San Francisco Art Institute for a party Thursday afternoon. There were like five kids sitting there talking and I asked them, “Okay, you guys. I’m totally out of it. What are the hippest films and books happening now?” and no one could think of anything. In the Sixties, I think “everyone” knew to read <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em>.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Someone gave me a daily subscription to the <em>Financial Times</em> but there’s hardly anything I want to read in it. However, the articles I do wanna read are really good. I’m lucky to find one article a day that I want to cut out. The ones on Monday have a disproportionate number of articles on women in the workplace and their rights issues and questions and suggestions on how not to get screwed. So, the Monday issue—that one’s packed. I try to read it right away with a pair of scissors and cut out the articles I want and put the rest instantly into recycling.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m not overly sympathetic to single people’s problems, but I think that as soon as you can: find a partner so there’s two of you working on the Number One Question: “How the fuck do we make next month’s rent?” That is the key question Every Day Of The Rest Of Your Life. And if there’s <em>two</em> of you worrying about it, it helps. It helps <em>everything</em>!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The key thing about trying to stay together and not hating each other after a while because little things about them annoy you is: Play word games, coin aphorisms, come up with puns, three-word phrases, rhymes. Rhymes are very important, alliteration is very important. That’s how you renew your relationship, every hour, every minute or whatever, is through language. You’ve got to get into spotting rhymes. Words are not just tools. Actually, you try for no separation between art and life, no separation between play and work—uhm, good luck with that! No separation between art and daily life. Have you noticed that a lot of people in their art don’t have humor? Some artists are way too serious.</p>

<p>Yeah, and sometimes it’s so subtle it takes someone else to point it out. Both of them embraced contradiction. I saw a photo of Warhol talking to a cardinal or a Pope; was he <em>really</em> religious?!? But years ago I read that Warhol regularly went to a church. Well, in a church you can get privacy and silence and no one bothers you. So they are havens. In fact, some of them are super beautiful inside; [here's an idea:] Tour all the local cathedrals as “art”!</p>

<p>I think there’s no such thing as individuals making breakthroughs. I think you will find behind so many famous artists historically, I would think if they had a wife, that wife was majorly responsible for a lot of the originality and quality control and a million other things. My wife edits everything that I write and improves it. So the smallest possible group is two. And then you might get a random email from someone you haven’t heard from for a while and they give you an idea and boom it’s incorporated in your work, your writing or language.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote a zine called <em>How to Read</em> and it has a little section called ""How to Write"" that I included as an afterthought. The first premise is: All reading is preparation for writing—<em>your</em> writing. In other words, don’t just <em>read</em> anymore, first ask: “How can this (what I’m about to read) improve <em>my</em> writing?” Well, you might learn a new word, a new phrase you can substitute words and repurpose and then it’s your original phrase. Basically, try to read <em>differently</em>. Read for <em>ideas</em> to improve your own personal writing because that’s all we are: language. When you get down to talking to anyone, you’re hoping for some kind of originality of language, some style, some word they use that is part of their signature speech... I think I strayed from your question about Art and Artifice. I think everyone ought to do as pure projects as they can and do them <em>fast</em> so they don’t get all corrupted and bogged down by <em>overthinking</em>. I think overthinking is a huge enemy—or it can be. And over-analysis.</p>

<p>It’s funny that a lot of this “atomization” is the byproduct of “liberation.” So many people are calling out for their own liberation and are forming groups.

Therefore knowledge can be free, instead of remaining the privilege of a few rich people who are rare book collectors. Well, the thing I didn’t predict was the rise of all this <em>dis-information</em> from the Trumpian types—far right-wingers. And how fanatical these people can get. And the internet can bring them all to Washington, D.C. on January 6 where at least five people died and hundreds were injured.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone has to start their own underground and try and support other people who have parallel undergrounds (assuming enough congruities).

I think about the “hippie” movement I was part of and there would be all these free gatherings in the Panhandle—not Golden Gate Park. Well, there was a so-called “Hippie Hill,” but was too far away; the Panhandle was just two blocks away from the corner of Haight and Ashbury. Then they started having free rock concerts there; if you didn’t get to see Jimi Hendrix at the Fillmore, he might be playing tomorrow afternoon at 4pm for free. But you needed that FREE SPACE. And now with covid for the next 10 years, we need more PARKS; outdoor space where you can just hang out or eat your sack lunch or meditate or do yoga or tai chi; whatever. Like when I went to the Art Institute Thursday night, I couldn’t even get suggestions as to the absolutely most essential, hippest, cutting-edge, ahead-of-the-curve film or book—</p>

<p>For the old know everything—including all the secrets of the young.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>—Gary Indiana</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I SPOKE FRENCH WITH MY MOTHER</strong>, performed in plays with my father, played the piano, listened to Beethoven and Verdi, and though the good people of eastern North Carolina are generally friendly and warm-hearted, they unsurprisingly made me feel like a foreigner every single day of the twenty years I lived among them. All I ever knew was anomie. Social distancing began for me in kindergarten.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My violently eccentric parents soon convinced me that my future lay in classical piano. I was going to win competitions, make records, perform all over the world. After all, I played better than anyone else my age in the region, so who could say otherwise?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the age of twenty-one, my piano dreams having gone up in smoke, I was sure of only two things:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1) I loved books more than anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2) I wanted to move to Paris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And this I did, on September 2, 1989.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once here, my intransigence, provincial ignorance, and social awkwardness made it hard for me to get along with most of my peers, but I was eager to learn all there was to know about the world of books, and find a way to forge my way into it. The only question was: how?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten years passed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I taught piano, I taught English, I studied translation, I found myself involved with a literary magazine, <em>Les Épisodes</em>. I also became more sociable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At one of our launch parties a young woman I knew, remarking on how relaxed I seemed around older folks, fixed me with a violet stare. Look here, she said, every family has fathers, brothers, uncles, lovers, grandmas, grandpas, bubbies, zubbies... You—you are the son. Destined always to filial duty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pinned and wriggling on the wall, what could I say to that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have always tended to look first to the past in music, art, and literature. When in early 2001 my French friend Max (not his real name) named me co-editor of <em>Les Épisodes</em>, I was deep into American literature of the 1960s and ‘70s. It dawned on me that I now had a perfect excuse to contact some of the writers from that time I was interested in—the <em>alte kackers</em>! The brilliant still alive oldsters!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first name on my list was Leonard Michaels (1933-2003).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second was Irving Rosenthal (1930-2022).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both were robustly American and more than a little wacky, with a wild, sexy, brutal humor, Yiddish rhythms crackling beneath the impeccable English prose. LM’s <em>Shuffle</em>, and IR’s <em>Sheeper</em> gave me goose-bumps, blew air through my hair (I had oodles of hair then), made me rejoice in language, gave me hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Michaels was bouncing around between Italy and the Bay Area and I found him rather easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rosenthal was reclusive. But I soon reached him through poet, photographer, and master shoplifter Ira Cohen (1935-2011).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though Ira was about as conspicuous as they come—rotund and bearded, a rundown beatnik Jewish Santa with tattoos, beads, necklaces, and, at times, a Spiderman mask—he had the knack, when he needed to go shopping, of becoming invisible. The French writer who put me in touch with Ira told me she saw him once stride into a supermarket grinning broadly and walk out with a turkey, a carton of milk, and three loaves of bread, without paying. And nobody said a word.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max and I flew to NYC in August, 2001 to hang out with Ira and Lenny (as I now called Leonard Michaels) and plan the next issue of <em>Les Épisodes</em>. After Max and I visited Ira in his Midtown apartment he came downstairs with us to the CVS Pharmacy, whence we witnessed him make off brazenly with Scotch tape, Brillo pads, and bananas. The only thing he paid for was a pack of cigarettes, because cigarettes were over the counter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few hours later, walking the streets with Lenny, I was struck by his strut, shoulders back, chest forward, his cock-of-the-walk here-I-am stride and swagger, his NYC pride and confidence... on the balls of his feet like a dancer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I ever dreamed of meeting Lenny, my self-styled fierce friend and fellow American expat in Paris Hubert Blair (not his real name) told me that one of his California friends had told him that <em>Leonard Michaels has a lightning bolt design in the floor of his kitchen in Berkeley, symbolizing his anger.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That lightning bolt blew Hubert and me away. I remember us grinning at each other, shaking our heads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the time and for a long time after I thought my own anger would buoy me on my dash toward literary relevance. I thought being neurotic was cool, useful, a tool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now my idol was bitter about being largely forgotten. I admired Lenny a hundred—a thousand, a million—times more than other writers of his generation who were recognized everywhere as geniuses, but I knew next to nothing then about the fickle business of literary reputations and the havoc it wreaks on egos. So when Lenny told me about having dinner once in London with Harold Pinter and not feeling intimidated and I asked him why he should have felt intimidated and he said, Well, you know, <em>Harold Fucking Pinter</em>! I countered with, Well yeah, but <em>Leonard Fucking Michaels</em>!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Max joined us at the Zebulon, a bar on East Broadway where a white dude played 1920s blues songs on acoustic guitar. A fist-sized black fish swam around in a tall tank next to the bar. Lenny and I drank beers and told each other filthy jokes (telling filthy jokes being one of my specialties—as it turned out, it was one of Lenny’s specialties, too. And by <em>filthy</em> I mean absolutely unprintable here).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pushing seventy, Lenny had a full head of hair and looked youthful. I rolled a cigarette for him. You’re killing me, he said, smoking. We laughed. Lenny signed and inscribed my copy of <em>Shuffle</em> on the bar:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>To Philippe, my future editor and translator, Lenny, NYC 2001</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never saw Lenny again. We planned to meet in Paris, but when he finally made it here I was visiting my parents in the States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, I introduced Lenny to Hubert Blair, who had recently moved to Rome, and they became fast friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lenny and I had regular email exchanges that resembled actual letters. He sent me pages of <em>Ginny</em>, an “extreme novel” he was working on about a high- school girl. I met with Parisian publishers to talk about getting Lenny’s work back into print in French, and Lenny wrote asking me if I had any business sense and did I want to be his agent. Some friends of his were interested in founding a publishing venture with the goal of publishing his book... <em>I really don’t want to waste time</em>, Lenny wrote. <em>If this becomes serious, let’s be serious. You will have to wear a shirt and tie and not seem to be enjoying life so much</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It did not become serious, but we had a good time. Lenny was unguarded and charming in our exchanges. He was clearly eager to claw his way back to literary relevance. Why not in France?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was amazed to be on such intimate terms with my distressed hero. I was going to save him if I could.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Lenny got sick Hubert called and said he thought he would pull through. Wishful thinking, that was. It seemed like one minute Lenny was sick and the next he had joined the ancestors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My grief at his passing was disproportionate; I hardly knew him. But I loved him.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hubert Blair had a rower’s build, a Dick Tracy jawline, and an extraordinary literary sensibility. Everyone who ever met him was shocked that he had not yet committed to paper the electrifying masterpiece he was obviously carrying within him. We first bonded over our shared admiration for Lenny. Though only a handful of years older than me, Hubert became my mentor, encouraging me to read David Foster Wallace, William Gass, William Gaddis, Jack Black (whose <em>You Can’t Win</em> stands on my bookshelf next to <em>How You Lose</em>, another prison masterpiece Hubert told me about), Gilbert Sorrentino, Denis Johnson, Carl Van Vechten, Irving Rosenthal, Robert Coover, Guy Davenport, William Bronk, William S. Wilson... Hubert loved to talk about writing, saying for example <em>you have to make every word do the work</em>. Once, after taking apart one of my stories, Hubert shook his head. I was <em>now left</em>, he said, <em>with the intractable problem of language</em>, which sounds impressive though I’m still not sure I know what it means. Hubert had hosts of literary, artistic, exiled political oddball friends of all nationalities, including the writer who calls himself Evan Dara, and he introduced me to all of them. Sadly, my immaturity, impulsiveness, and growing success at meeting, befriending and publishing authors he admired coupled with Hubert’s all-consuming self-loathing and neuroticism (not to mention a dad- shaped hole in his psyche that put mine to shame) conspired to snuff out our friendship shortly after Lenny died.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A week after first speaking with Ira on the phone, I received from him a fat colorfully-stamped envelope containing <em>Licking the Skull</em>, a “retrospectacle” on glossy paper of Ira’s photographic works in color and black and white published by NYC gallery owner Cynthia Broan, including one in color of an Indian gentleman in a beige cap cradling a human skull to his cheek, stuck-out tongue ready to lick it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ira’s parents, like Lenny’s, like Irving’s, were immigrants from eastern Europe—with the added twist that Ira’s were both deaf. Ira’s first language was sign language. Once when Ira was a toddler he knocked over a boiling pot of water and scalded himself and screamed but his parents couldn’t hear him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And here you are, all these years later, still screaming, I said to Ira on the phone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Very funny, Ira rasped. It was through Ira that I met poet Edward Field (1924-), and through Ed, a few years later, editor and essayist Ted Solotaroff (1928-2008), who lived part of the year in Paris.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ira met Irving in 1963 in Tangier, where Ira, using money from an inheritance, launched the magazine Gnaoua in which excerpts from <em>Sheeper</em> appeared for the first time. Irving, critic and novelist Alfred Chester, and novelist Charles Wright lived briefly together with Ira and his wife Rosalind in what was dubbed the “bat palace” after Rosalind one night butchered and cooked a bat they all ate a piece of. According to Ira, Irving asked to eat the penis (<em>he said it tasted like gefilte fish</em>, Chester wrote to his friend Ed Field in New York).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Irving was an elfin man with a gigantic ego. Ira said that he picked Irving up once and he felt as heavy as a sack of onions. At first my relationship with him was hunky dory. He was eager to share his stories, and would coo that he never minded being interrupted by me when I called him to chat and hear about what he was reading and doing. When I asked Irving about Alfred Chester he said that Alfred had sent him <em>The Exquisite Corpse</em> signed with an inscription and Irving had ripped out the autograph to keep and thrown away the book. He also told me once that the young men who came to his commune were free of drugs and women, which made things a lot easier, as if loving women were as dangerous to one’s health as mainlining heroin (perhaps unsurprisingly, Irving once wrote, <em>homo sex is the only realistic solution to the world’s population problem</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Uncannily like my mother (with whom he shared an October 9 birthday), Irving would get upset with me at fairly regular intervals, over a trifle, and then “punish” me by interrupting all interaction for a given time. So I would end up writing an email to apologize for the clouds hovering above our heads, hoping my words would manage to disperse them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Irving is autocratic, Ira said. He’s antihuman. He’s such a shit.</p>

<p>Ed Field’s longtime companion Neil Derrick was blind, and it was humbling over the years for Emma and me to walk the streets of Paris, London, and New York with them, watching Ed lead the way with Neil’s hand on his shoulder. Curb coming up, Ed would say. OK. Step. They had it down tight. Rarely did they break stride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ed and Neil were lean and fit, and though Ed was primarily a poet, he and Neil wrote gay porn and historical novels together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first time we met Ed and Neil in Paris they were keen on discussing the zippers on the trousers of the French riot police (the CRS as they are known in French).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about their zippers? I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It turned out, Ed explained, smiling with relish, his jet-black eyes narrowing to slits, that whereas normally a fly unzips from top to bottom, the CRS fellows had flies that unzipped from bottom to top. Why was that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I said I didn’t know what he was talking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You never noticed? Ed said, arching his eyebrows, surprised I didn’t share his penchant for crotch watching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ted Solotaroff had four sons and a tendency to consider any man under forty as fair filial game. It’s like having another son around, Ted said about me not long after we met.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ted had sad dog eyes that occasionally flashed with passion. He would at regular intervals drum with his hands on his knees or thighs, pensive, mouth open, looking alarmingly like a fish out of water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intrigued by my bilingualism, he asked if I read French writers from a French perspective, and American writers from an American one. I said that I did and Ted suggested I write an essay about bilingualism. I said I didn’t think I knew what to say about bilingualism or how it worked—that I only knew the two languages were wholly separate and whole in my mind—and he quoted Alfred Kazin, who when asked one day what he was going to write about, answered:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t know; I haven’t spoken with my typewriter yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ted smiled. Trust the writing process, he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Irving had planted a pernicious spidery seed in me: the belief that a writer should write<em> from within the parliament of writers</em>, showing writers what you could do in order hopefully to surpass them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That sounds like a perfect recipe for writer’s block, Ted said. He shook his head. You know, when you write, you just have to walk out to the mound and start pitching.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I asked Ted about Lenny he said Lenny’s writing was violent. Very terse stories. No fat on that animal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I asked him about Tobias Wolff, Ted said Toby’s writing was like a mountain stream: dip in anywhere—he dropped his hand to his side—and you can feel the current.</p>

<p>Harry Mathews (1930-2017) was another writer on Hubert Blair’s radar, the kind of writer Hubert said was <em>marginal</em>—though <em>major in the margins</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One day I came across a lovely little book by HM, called <em>The Orchard</em>, a remembrance of his friendship with French writer Georges Perec, whose death in 1982 from lung cancer at the age of forty-six, came, HM wrote, <em>as a scarcely credible shock</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In deceptively simple prose, and borrowing Joe Brainard’s <em>I remember</em> technique, HM reveals in a few dozen tableaux his deep love for his departed friend by remembering GP’s fondness for TV and radio jingles, and disposable Wilkinson razors, and cartoons, and restaurants, and waiters; his sneezing fits and beautiful green gray eyes; and taking GP to the elementary school in Villard-de-Lans where GP had been hidden—and even baptized under an assumed name—during the Occupation and the director asking GP if he were related to GP, and GP saying: <em>But I am GP</em>!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>HM lived in Paris part of the year. I looked him up and called the number. A man’s voice answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monsieur Mathews? I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Lui-même</em>, HM replied in a voice of velvet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stammered a few words about his gorgeous pages on GP, and his hilarious novel, <em>My Life in CIA</em>, which I had recently read and loved, and he invited me to have lunch with him the next day at Les Fins gourmets, a small bistro on Boulevard St- Germain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tall, barrel-chested yet frail looking, HM wore a green shirt, green pants and a sleeveless vest full of pockets out of one of which spilled a white plastic bag. He greeted me as an old friend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We chose an outside table under the protective sprawl of the restaurant’s green awning. First Harry wanted to know what kind of wine I wanted to drink. I said whatever he wanted to drink. Then he asked:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you smoke?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had quit smoking cigarettes a few years back, but still reserved the right to smoke a few on occasion. But no, I didn’t have any cigarettes on me, I told him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the waiter came to our table he greeted HM warmly—<em>Bonjour Monsieur Matty-ooze</em>!—and Harry, shaking his hand, smiled and said:</p>

<p><strong><em>THE ART OF ASSEMBLAGE</em></strong>, the monumental exhibition at MoMA in 1961 curated by William C. Seitz, put assemblage on the art world’s radar. The venturesome uptown Martha Jackson Gallery had included assemblage, along with collage and installation art, in New Forms—New Media, a two-part exhibition staged in 1960. In an essay for the Jackson show’s catalog, Allan Kaprow emphasized immediacy, waste, and movement as defining the new forms, a foreshadowing of his own pioneering of the Happening. Both exhibitions were comparably ambitious, but the MoMA show reached a much broader audience and traveled to contemporary art museums in Dallas and San Francisco.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his influential catalog essay for the MoMA exhibition, Seitz attributed the first assemblage to Picasso in 1912 (<em>Still Life with Chair Caning</em>) and noted that Jean Dubuffet was the first to use the word. The exhibition traced the “metaphysics” of the newfound genre, which Seitz defined in two ways:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. They are predominantly assembled rather than painted, drawn, modeled, or carved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Entirely or in part, their constituent elements are preformed natural or manufactured materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four California artists were shown at <em>The Art of Assemblage</em>—Bruce Conner, George Herms, Jess (Collins), and Edward Kienholz. For a taste of the panoply of objects used, there was George Herms’ <em>Poet</em> (1960), a thick stack of dirtied papers with tattered edges, tied with string, perched atop a wooden table pedestal, with a rusted car horn pointing up from behind the stack; when combined into a sculptural form, these elements alchemize into a portrait of a scrappy poet: his voice—the horn; his words—the stack; his body—the pedestal. Bruce Conner’s <em>Last Supper</em> (1961), also on view, listed only wax, rags, and “etc.” atop a wooden table. Here it was not the visible objects that mattered, but what had been obscured by the thick wax-rag patina—soured and forsaken— encumbered by time and neglect. Conner described his sculptures as “stages from which the actors are absent, where the viewer must piece together the story from the remaining props.” Assemblage turned the viewer into a detective, searching for clues and meaning.</p>

<p class=""indented"">These Neo-Dadaists, as they were sometimes called, focused their reaction on the increased materiality of their environment, choosing to address the explosion of consumer products rather than the flat printed matter that was ubiquitous before the Great War. Going beyond their predecessors, however, the Assemblage artists revealed that the quotidian could be macabre, rueful, preposterous. But the Assemblage artists differed from the Dadaists. As John Coplans wrote in a 1963 essay for <em>Artforum</em>, they “created a whole new side of absurd art that comments on man’s fears, joys, nightmares, and ecstasies, but which is marked by a highly radical, anarchistic and symbolist sensibility loaded with current moral judgment.” Following the large-scale dissemination of wartime images and stories of human cruelty and disaster, these artists were trying to stick the broken bits of detritus back together. What if you could take something from everyday life and break it, bend it, snap it, fold it, scrunch it, and “destroy” it in some way to say to your audience, “Here, let me show you what you have <em>really</em> been looking at.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In their post-atomic state, the California Assemblage artists had to choose between continuing on the staid path (painting, sculpture, collage) or explode the field, literally, and carry on with a medium that was completely new—visually, materially, spiritually and socially. Without the magnifying glass of the New York art establishment, California artists were forced to support themselves and one another through artist-run galleries and events. By deeply entrenching themselves in community, these artists were able to produce culture-changing events such as Allen Ginsberg’s reading of “Howl” at Six Gallery, run by artists and poets Wally Hedrick, Jack Spicer, Deborah Remington, John Allen Ryan, Hayward King and David Simpson; Wallace Berman’s <em>Semina</em> magazine (the narrowly distributed Assemblage magazine) generation; Bruce Baillie’s film collective Canyon Cinema; and much more. It was here, in California, where artists were able to synthesize their fractured environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the acts of assembling the ephemera of their daily lives, these artists also seemed to be saying, “We will not let you forget.” Noah Purifoy and Judson Powell, directors at Watts Tower Arts Center (a Los Angeles icon of Assemblage), took to the streets following the Watts riots of 1966 and collected actual tons of the demonstration’s residue, with no set purpose at the time. But the purpose soon became self-evident. When Purifoy and Powell invited other artists to work with their collected materials, the result was an exhibition called <em>66 Signs of Neon</em>. “The distilled spirit of <em>66 Signs of Neon</em>,” the final sentence of the exhibition pamphlet states, “tells us that the world is a confused and fearful place, that God is difficult to find, that our philosophic systems are imperfect, that the only hope is communication between individuals: ‘I DON’T HAVE ANYBODY BUT YOU!’”</p>

<p class=""indented"">An image of <em>Sir Watts</em> by Noah Purifoy depicts a truncated knight in shining armor, with a cascade of safety pins falling out of the heart cavity, a service bell for a right shoulder, and a mesh coin purse for a facial feature. The knight’s neck and head have merged into one, reminiscent of the Pickelhaube, head tilted slightly forward, as if in a mournful pose. The honorific soldier of Watts, heart spilling out yet still hooked and pinned all together, slim drawers for an abdomen that can be open and shut—who is the hero in this story: one individual, or an entire community?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Assemblage expanded what an art practice could be and what an artwork could say, and while these artists didn’t need traditional artistic training to (re)assemble the world, many well-known (male) artists—Romare Bearden, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Motherwell, Robert Rauschenberg—received an arts education for free under the benevolence of the GI Bill. Interestingly, fewer Assemblage artists in California benefited from the Bill, but those who did—Jess, Jerry Ross Barrish, Llyn Foulkes, Wally Hedrick, John Outterbridge, Noah Purifoy, and Peter Voulkos—used the opportunity to mine and transform their visions of society into unfaithful reproductions and riot artifacts, creating a kind of time capsule of a rebel postwar California. Who needed expensive materials such as oil paint, stretched canvases, bronze, marble or a printing press when the street was the art store? Nor did they need a dedicated art studio to practice in. Assemblage can be any size, made out of any thing, completed rapidly or slowly. Moving beyond the influential Dadaist collage, these Assemblage artists, educated at government expense and begotten by war, took the stuff of the world and cut it, smashed it, and distorted it into art objects that told a story of a new kind of modernity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One could argue that the field of Assemblage expanded well beyond the confines of institutional walls, and artists began creating artworks in and with nature—and with themselves—perhaps most famously <em>Spiral Jetty</em> by Robert Smithson or <em>Shoot</em> by Chris Burden. But in order to understand these truly groundbreaking works of the 1970s, we must consider the importance of the Assemblage artworks of the 1950s and ‘60s and where they lie within the art historical lineage. Pop Art would supersede Assemblage as soon as 1962 (giving Assemblage but one year in the spotlight), but California artists remained steadfast in their vision of incorporating discarded, everyday items in their artwork. In her dissertation, Rebecca Solnit posits this is the “first postwar art movement to explore popular culture.” Without Assemblage’s exploration of our increasingly material world, it is difficult to imagine how Pop Art would have germinated, progressed, and well, mushroomed.</p>

2390,"Alfredo Jaar","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">In late September last year, a Norwegian surveillance plane dropped a sonar buoy in the Baltic Sea. Its purpose: to send an underwater signal that would trip some C4 explosives laid by American Navy divers, three months earlier, on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines lining the ocean floor between Russia and Germany. It was a good buoy: The pipelines exploded, and President Biden wiped his hands.<br>
<br>
This version of events comes from investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who, earlier this year, published an article on Substack which frames the Nord Stream bombing as a covert and multinational operation headed by the United States. Other reports by media outlets like the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Der Spiegel</em> have blamed a pro-Ukrainian group of rebels, but Hersh, citing a source with secret intelligence, is sure this was an American act of war.<br>
<br>
So too was the artist Alfredo Jaar, in February, when he referred to Hersh’s article in a talk titled “It Is Difficult” at Principia College for the Schmidt Family Lecture Series in Contemporary Art. Pacing back and forth on a small stage in a packed Wanamaker Hall, the soft-spoken Jaar, dressed in a black long-sleeved shirt and trousers, called Hersh the “greatest American journalist alive” for holding the United States accountable. In the same breath, he chastised everyone else: “Not a single media outlet in the United States has discussed this discovery, because it’s not convenient—it’s terrorism, an act of war.”<br>
<br>
Unmasking the media’s affair with convenience has driven much of Jaar’s work. In 1994, while genocide raged in Rwanda, <em>Newsweek</em> put antioxidants, D-Day, and Jacqueline Kennedy on the cover of its magazine. Jaar would memorialize this “barbaric indifference” in <em>Newsweek</em> (1994), a sequence of seventeen covers from April 1994 when the genocide began, to August 1, 1994, when the magazine finally made Rwanda the cover story. In what came to be the Rwanda Project—25 artworks over 6 years—Jaar asked, How do you represent the unrepresentable truth of human tragedy? “Each project is an answer,” he said. “They all fail and that’s why I keep doing it.”<br>
<br>
Jaar is unconventional. In his talk, he introduced himself as an artist who never studied art. “I don’t know what art is,” he said, “but I respond to my context.” Recently, this context, like the context of many who follow the news in the United States, has been molded by images of war in Ukraine. “But the fixation on Ukraine,” Jaar said, “has erased many tragedies.” He referred to a recent cover of the <em>Economist</em> showing a bleeding Ukrainian flag. “I thought, Why didn’t you do a similar cover for all of the conflicts that are identical or worse than Ukraine right now? So I used the cover as a model.”<br>
<br>
The day before Jaar’s lecture, a strong wind had blown in from the west, knocking over chairs and grounding branches. On the morning after, when we sat down to talk on the Voney Art Center patio overlooking the Mississippi, the wind had stopped, the river appeared to be still, and it was warm enough to be in a t-shirt and shorts. Our conversation was cut short by the throes of a faculty lunch, but we picked it up a few weeks later on Google Meet. My thanks to Paul Ryan, Professor of Studio Art,for making this conversation possible.

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM:</strong> The theme for this issue is “The Postwar,” and the way the editors define it is very conventional–from the end of World War II in 1945 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. But as you showed us in your talk, there really isn’t a postwar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Well, you’re right. In thinking about “postwar” today, in light of what’s happening around us, “postwar” is an illusion. And this so- called postwar really planted the seeds of the next war. And that’s where we find ourselves today.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went to Rwanda in 1994 to witness the genocide. That was a turning point in my life. I came back from Rwanda ashamed of being human. That tragedy was one more consequence of the colonization of Africa by Europe—in this case, Belgium. Witnessing a genocide, and being in refugee camps with a million people, and being in a church where 565 people were killed—I’m walking around bodies, corpses on the ground—I was not thinking about <em>postwar</em>. The more I say “postwar,” the more absurd it sounds.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Your lecture felt like a postcolonial critique of war. When you showed those photos of Alan Kurdi and quoted Mario Calabresi—“This is the beach where Europe dies”—I was reminded of something Aimé Césaire said: “Europe is indefensible.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This idea of “postcolonial” is as illusory as “postwar.” Unfortunately, the “colonies” are pretty much alive, not in a clearly physical way, but in a virtual way. In a structural way, they’re still functioning as colonies. The former colonies are extremely dependent on the former colonizers. And conflicts exist now because these former colonies that are still colonies are trying to distance themselves from that system of oppression.</p>

<p class=""indented"">It is well known that the reason for the Iraq War was because Saddam Hussein had decided to sell Iraqi oil in Euros and not in US dollars. That was shortly after the birth of the Euro. At first, the US thought the Euro was a joke, but then, they panicked. They said, We cannot allow this. So they invaded, inventing the war on terror and weapons of mass destruction. September 11 was completely unrelated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is very difficult for the former colonies to actually break those structural bonds. The US will not concede the supremacy of the world to Russia or to the Chinese or to a world that is more equal. As I said yesterday, I’m very pessimistic. Intellectually, I don’t see any hope, but my will is still optimistic. It’s interesting how we are really talking about language, how language exists to give us the illusion of stability. It’s better for business.</p>

<p>And, you know, besides being insane, it is illegal. What the US is doing, what Australia is doing, what Europe is doing—it goes against the Geneva Convention. No one talks about that. But when a big country like the US is doing it, other countries realize they have permission to do it, and they know no one will touch them.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">The title of your lecture is “It is difficult.” Will you talk about that wording?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is a title that I’ve used for the last fifteen years. I would give a lot of lectures and I was tired of coming up with a new title every time. I start my lectures by saying that I’ve been an artist for four decades, and it is not becoming easier. It is becoming more difficult to be an artist. So it’s about the difficulty of being an artist today, about how we make art when the world is in such a state. How do we make art with information that most of us would rather ignore? The words come from a beautiful poem by William Carlos Williams, which I also quote often in my lectures:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">It is difficult<br>
to get the news from poems<br>
yet men die miserably every day<br>
for lack<br>
of what is found there.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">It’s an extraordinary poem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">That “there” could be in the poems or in the news.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exactly. That’s where it is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">How would you describe the state of the news and media landscape today, and how has this landscape changed—or remained the same—since you began paying attention to the news?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The internet has created a small revolution of sorts because now the news is a public space open to almost everyone. Social media has become a place where news circulates that wouldn’t necessarily make the front page of the papers or magazines or even TV. It is an extraordinary counterbalance to the extraordinary bias of our media system. This bias has always existed, but in situations like the Ukraine invasion, it has never been more clear that Europe and the United States have one vision of the world, while everyone else has another vision. Europe and the United States represent only 14% of the world population, and only 14% of the world population has approved of the West giving arms to Ukraine. But Western media makes us feel that this is world opinion. It is not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would say that the world wants peace and negotiation. The US has been stopping negotiations because they want Putin to fall. They don’t care if more Russians and Ukrainians die. The US is feeding this tragedy. The Chinese are proposing a ceasefire and the US is saying, No, it’s too early. They want to set up the parameters of this war and the parameters of this possible ceasefire. But you’ll find counterbalanced information and opinions on social media. Of course, it doesn’t have a presence in the world like most of the media, but more people are reading these things and starting to think differently from what they are being told to think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">You use the methodology of an architect to make art. “For an architect,” you said in your lecture, “context is everything. An architect responds to his context.” Your recent press work responds to Western media representations of the war in Ukraine, but you call these responses “therapy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m perfectly aware that the effect that I may have doing this work is minimal. So if I’m asked, Why the hell do you do it, I say that it serves me as a kind of therapy. It’s a way for me to express my rage, to express my outrage, to express my opinion, and to share a more balanced view of the situation with the audience. I know it’s a lost cause, but at least I’ve done something about it. Going back to Gramsci, it’s my will acting like this because it offers a breathing space. But intellectually, I know that it’s not going to make a big difference. But for every person that sees and agrees with me, I get some joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m showing these works in London next month. I don’t know what the audience will be. I don’t know what the press will be like, but I’m hoping that it will have some kind of impact, even though the situation is tricky: I’m criticizing the press and I’m hoping the press will talk about the work criticizing the press. So it might not happen at all. Even though I’ve always believed that no institution is monolithic. When we look at something like, for example, the <em>New York Times</em>, of course, they have an extraordinary bias. But within the <em>New York Times</em>, there are individuals, and once in a while, some of these individuals manage to stay afloat of the ideological agenda of the <em>New York Times</em> and say things that manage to go through the editor, the censorship within the paper.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Returning to the way poetry enters your work, I wanted to ask you about Pier Paolo Pasolini. He’s an important postwar figure, and you’ve described him as an influence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pasolini is one of my heroes. He was not only a writer, a poet, a filmmaker, he was an intellectual. He was a critic and polemicist. He was someone involved in the culture of Italy and Europe. His voice was the voice of the intellectual, and he was someone that would take risks intellectually all the time. A famous case was in Rome in 1968 after the battle of Valle Giulia, a huge confrontation between the police and Communist students. The students were protesting, but Pasolini wrote a poem where he sided with the police. Of course, the entire Italian left took the side of the students. But Pasolini said, No, in this case, I’m with the poor who have been forced to police you because they have no other choice. No intellectual today would take a risk like that. Now, this was a very specific case. But Pasolini has always been the model of intellectual I want to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">How do you model yourself after Pasolini?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was always speaking out and giving his opinion, not only within the world of culture, but also in the world at large. That’s what I try to do. Sadly, the art world is a world of fiction, and it’s very self-referential. You walk around Chelsea, where my studio is now, and you go from gallery to gallery and you don’t see anything about what’s happening around the world. Very few artists touch on subjects other than themselves. I’m interested in the world in which we live, and I’m interested in responding to what’s happening around me. I’m trying to get out of this world of fiction. I’m trying to get reality into the world of art. Another way of thinking about Pasolini is that he was making connections. A protest was not just a protest. A cultural event was not just a cultural event. He would write about these events and connect history with the present and what it means for the future. That’s a skill that very few intellectuals have. Finally, he was a risk-taking intellectual. Perhaps Chomsky is the closest thing today. Chomsky can say whatever he wants and remain untouchable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Pasolini said that culture is a prison for the intellectual. This was the basis of your installation, <em>Infinite Cell</em>, in <em>The Gramsci Trilogy</em> from 2005. Is risk-taking the way out of this “culture prison”?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was suggesting that the world of culture was a prison because we were in it and not looking at the world at large. He wanted to get out of that “prison.” The only way to do that is to get out of the gallery, the museum, the theater. I created <em>Infinite Cell</em> in homage to Pasolini. It’s a normal cell inside a gallery, but there are two walls that are mirrored. So when you are inside, you look left, you look right, and it’s completely infinite. The cell never ends. I was trying to represent that infinite cell he is talking about by inviting people to enter and see how it feels to be in that infinite cell—which is, for me, the world of culture—and then to get out of that cell. He was criticizing the world of culture, not because of culture itself. Culture is a marvelous thing that exists for me, culture is a way to breathe. Nietzsche said that in a world without music, life would be a mistake. To paraphrase, a world without art and culture would be a mistake. It would be unlivable. Pasolini believed in culture, and that’s why he was such a prolific producer of books and poetry and films. He didn’t reject culture, but he wanted to make culture with the world, not the self.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And he was critical of postwar Italian consumerism, especially television. He loathed the “dogma of religion.” He was “unique,” Gary Indiana wrote, “in his nervous mingling of intense, alienated Catholicism with Gramscian Communism.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, that was part of his critique. Culture was not only a cell, but it was a cell participating in the market forces of neoliberal capitalism. He was fighting from all sides. He was desperate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Desperate, passionate, controversial. He strikes me as an iconoclast, which is how I think of you—the way you refuse to take images in the media as truth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did a film on Pasolini called <em>The Ashes of Pasolini</em>. I made it in Italy for the Venice Biennial at the time of Berlusconi. He had four terms as president. He was Trump before Trump. He owned most of the media in Italy. He had a dictatorship of the media through his company, Media Set. At that time, I thought that Italy needed a voice like Pasolini to express his dissidence.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">I was hoping you could talk about your recent show, “The Temptation to Exist.” It includes works by artists from 1950 to the present, so it strikes me as a melting pot of postwar consciousness—from the point of view of the artist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had never done a show like this. It was almost like a public confession—as an artist intellectual— of how I felt at that time. Normally, I leave the biographical stuff outside of my work. I’m very shy and reserved and introverted. But Galerie Lelong had invited me to do something. At that moment, I was having a big piece at the Whitney Biennial, but I accepted the challenge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I left the main space of the gallery empty— this is 90% of the gallery—and illuminated it with red lights. I created a very dense red light in the entire space. And when you reach the end of the space, you find a huge neon, which had a quote from Seneca:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">WHAT NEED<br>
IS THERE<br>
TO WEEP<br>
OVER PARTS<br>
OF LIFE?<br>
THE WHOLE<br>
OF IT CALLS<br>
FOR TEARS.
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That Seneca quote set the stage. The neon was red and it was big. To add to the red atmosphere we installed red lights on the skylight, on the windows at the entrance, and on the ceiling. I wanted to suggest a space of loss, a space of mourning, a space of melancholy, a space of nostalgia, a space where I declared, “I’ve been an artist for 40 years, and I have no idea what to do today.” This was at the start of the supposed post-Covid era. The war had started in Ukraine. Roe v. Wade had been defeated in the Supreme Court. And so on. I was at a loss, and I didn’t know how to move forward. The red space represented that reality.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">But the gallery also has a small space, which is completely separate from the big space. And I thought, Alfredo, don’t be so hopeless. Offer a counterbalance. Explain why you are an artist. Why, like Gramsci, you believe that art can effect change. So I had this idea, and I drove the gallery crazy because it was all loans. They brought them from Europe, from Asia, from Africa. It cost them a fortune. Nothing was for sale. But they believed in the idea. So we had this extraordinary exhibition. There were more than a hundred works in that tiny space, because I wanted to create an explosion of meaning, an explosion of resistance, an explosion of joy. I wanted to say, “This is how I feel within the red space—I’m lost. But go into the next room and see what art has been able to do.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was very biased. I chose works that I like. I have no idea if other people like them, but these are works that have been very important in my life.If I had to make a list of the 10 top works in the history of art, most of them were in that space. I think they’re absolutely brilliant in the way they think about an issue and then resolve the issue and communicate this to the audience. The gallery almost went broke. Nothing sold, absolutely nothing, because the works were owned by the artists or by collections. But galleries have their programs. They have their best sellers. And they have artists like me that they think are important to show, to complement their program, and who do not follow the market system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">I noticed there were only six portraits of Pasolini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The gallery said, “Okay, Alfredo, bring one.” But I brought six. And I requested the photos by Letizia Battaglia, who sadly passed away a week after signing those six prints—and that’s why I dedicate the show to her at the entrance. So I wanted the pictures of Pasolini to be a kind of mantra everywhere. Pasolini, Pasolini, Pasolini, Pasolini. And Gramsci. I have made a lot of Gramsci drawings. There was a time where every morning I would do one Gramsci drawing. So I selected a few, and they’re also in the show. Pasolini and Gramsci everywhere in between the other works. That was the idea.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You mentioned your “top ten” in the history of art. Which ones fall under this category?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, take the piece by Lawrence Weiner. This is a 1x1m cut in the wall—above the Valie Export—where he suggests that you have to make a 1x1 meter cut and remove the first layer of the wall to reveal what’s behind. That’s the work. It’s from 1968, and it’s owned by MoMA. You have to ask for a permit, a loan, even though MoMA doesn’t give you anything. You have to do everything yourself. And it takes a year to get that permit because the MoMA is a huge bureaucratic machine. But we managed to get it. That’s one of my favorite works of all time. I mean, context is everything, and that work simply tells you, Let’s look behind this wall. I love those kinds of gestures. As I said, most people don’t give a damn about that hole in the gallery. People asked, What is that hole doing in the middle of the gallery?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">That work is similar to the Hans Haacke piece, which is called <em>Condensation Cube</em> (1963-64). This is also one of my favorites of all time. It’s an extraordinary work. This is when he was working with natural systems before moving into political systems in the Sixties. Basically, it’s a cube filled in with a couple of inches of water, and it responds to the temperature of the room—if it’s cold or hot or windy or if there are people inside, all of these things change the temperature and create condensation within the cube. So the cube is a perfect thermometer that is reading the context of the gallery space. Those things drive me crazy. I love them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another one is Yoko Ono’s <em>Cut Piece</em> (1965) that she did very young in a theater in Tokyo. It was a performance, one of her first performances. And she kneels on the stage in a dress, and she invites the audience to come up with scissors and to cut a piece of her clothing. So they come and cut and cut and cut. And in the end, she’s almost naked. She has to protect her breasts because whatever is left is starting to fall. I think it’s one of the most beautiful, poetic and intelligent pieces of all time. Another work in the show is <em>Mirror Piece</em> (1969) by Joan Jonas. This is also in the Sixties, when she did a performance with a group of young women. They all went out with mirrors, and the mirrors were reflecting everything around them. They sat on the grass with the mirrors hiding their bodies, but showing the sky, and so on. It’s a beautiful and poetic piece. It’s also about context, about saying, Look at the world! Look at the world! So that’s what these works do. They think about the world and not only about the so-called art world. And that takes me to James Baldwin’s quote, when he says, “Life is more important than art. That’s why art is so important.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">There’s a photo by Shirin Neshat, from her <em>Women of Allah</em> series, to the left of Weiner’s 1x1m hole in the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above the big Pasolini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Yes, above the big Pasolini. In this photo there is a Muslim woman and she’s pointing a gun at the viewer. Across the room, there’s a photo by Juan Downey, <em>Yanomami with Camera</em>. In both of these images, the subject points a machine at the viewer—a gun, a camera—in such a way that they could be the same thing: gun as camera, camera as gun. Do you see it that way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t think about that connection. A lot of artists who are activists, like me, think that if we were not artists, we would be freedom fighters. We would be so-called terrorists. We would do things out in the real world. So art is a place for us to express ideas and critiques, but in peace, and in the space of culture. I always like those works by Shirin because they show women taking arms and reacting to what’s happening around them. She’s from Iran, and she was speaking specifically about the context of women in Iran. She’s a good friend of mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Juan Downey’s image is one of three images that do something I have never seen before, and I had always wanted to put them together. One is the image by Claudia Andujar, a Brazilian photographer that went to the Amazon, even before Juan Downey photographed the Yanomami on the Brazilian side. Juan Downey visited the Yanomami in the early ‘70s on the Venezuelan side. These are the two artists that are very well known who have worked with the Yanomami. Today we are interested in Indigenous rights and so on. But this was in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s. So I thought it would be interesting to have Claudia’s image, which photographs the Yanomami, next to Downey’s image, which shows the Yanomami photographing him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those were two very important images that I wanted to connect. And the third image is the one above them by Giuseppe Penone, which is a work that I’ve always liked—it’s in my top 10. In that piece, Penone put some contact lenses that are mirrored in his eyes. So he’s reversing his eyes. He’s not seeing anything. And when you look at him, you see yourself in his eyes. Because it’s a mirror. So the piece is called, To Reverse Your Eyes. It’s not about looking in, but looking out. It’s a fantastic piece from the early ‘70s. They never picked him as part of the so-called arte povera movement. But for me, that work is one of the most important of that era.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Before we end, could you talk about your work in the show? I’m thinking of your early work, which you made in response to the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile—like <em>11.9.73.1210.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few works about Chile. There’s <em>Studies on Happiness</em>. And my small Coca-Cola calendar, which I put next to the Coca-Cola bottles by Cildo Meireles, a piece that he made in response to the military dictatorship in Brazil. I thought it would be interesting to add Cildo’s bottles to help explain my own context and how I learned to react to my context, which was a different world—censorship, killings, and so on. So my Coke calendar is a kind of homage to Cildo’s Coke bottles. This is when I was born, let’s say, metaphorically, intellectually, as an artist.</p>

<p>In the Seventies, Cildo was living under the dictatorship in Brazil. He was a young artist just starting, and he would go to a bar and he would drink a bottle of Coca-Cola. At the time, the bottles would be sent back to the factory. They were washed, filled again with Coke, and sent back to the bar. There was a continuous recycling of the glass bottles. So what he did was design an adhesive with white text that had messages against the dictatorship and against the US, who had, of course, supported the coup. He would say, YANKEES GO HOME!, or messages like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So he would go to the bar with friends or alone, he would drink a Coke, and maybe if no one was watching, he would take the bottle to the bathroom and glue this calcomanía, this adhesive, on the bottle. But because the letters are white and the bottle is empty, it’s transparent. You don’t see anything. But when these bottles get refilled, the text becomes readable. They reveal themself only when the Coke is back inside the bottle. In the factory, no one was checking the bottles. So they would just fill them up and send them to the bars. And in the bars, someone is having a Coke, and suddenly they find this message, this subversive message against the dictatorship coming from the Coke factory. That piece is called <em>Insertions into Ideological Circuits</em>.</p>

<p>And that’s what we do as artists. We insert ideas into existing ideological circuits. That’s why it’s one of my favorite pieces. I have it in my home. I have three bottles in my home and I live with them. When I created the Coke calendar, it was an homage to Cildo. I was using a formula I had been using in the ‘70s in Chile, where I was suggesting that after September 11th, 1973, every day is an 11th. The nightmare had started and we didn’t know when it was going to end. It took 17 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you mentioned this piece, <em>11.9.73.1210</em>, which I made when I was starting my studies of architecture. I had discovered Letraset, those plastic letters used to mark floor plans and drawings. They sell sheets of these letters in different sizes. And you glue them with a little instrument on your floor plans. I discovered these letters and I was in love with them. I was playing with them. So a year after the coup, I had this black cardboard on my desk, and I thought, I’m going to play with Letraset. And I thought, I’m going to put the date of the coup, which marked my life, which changed my life. So I put 11 September 1973. And when I finished, I felt that first it wasn’t dense enough, it was too simplistic. It was good for me because it was a reminder of what changed my life, but I wanted something more. Instead of cutting the board, I thought it would be nice to add something to make it symmetrical. I thought, I’m going to put the time of the first bomb that destroyed the Moneda Palace, which was the presidential palace. And that was at 12:10. So then it became 11 September 73, 12:10, which is an even more precise moment when the catastrophe started, when the first bomb fell on La Moneda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some reason I kept this piece, because I keep everything. And then much later, 20, 30 years later, I thought, it looks like this was my first artwork, the first time I did something that went beyond graphic design. And now it’s part of my works from that era. It’s a very biographical work. And it’s a gesture to incorporate my biography and to, again, confess: This is when I was born, this is what I like. This is how I think, this is who I am. And I’m at a loss right now in the red space.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism, and the World<br>
by Malcolm Harris<br>
Little, Brown &amp; Company, 2023<br>
$36.00</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>BERATING TECH EXECUTIVES IS BORING.</strong> It’s time for a deeper, more holistic and historical critique of the place we’ve learned to call Silicon Valley. Now we have Malcolm Harris’s <em><a href=""https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/malcolm-harris/palo-alto/9780316592031/?lens=little-brown"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Palo Alto</a></em>, which argues that the Valley’s most pernicious tendencies are nothing new. From Harris’s perspective, they reach easily from the age of the gold rush and the genocide of Indigenous people across California, through the rabid anticommunism of Herbert Hoover and the explosion of eugenics, through the development of Cold War terror technologies and the violent oppression of liberation movements worldwide, down to the catastrophically unequal society we live in now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Palo Alto</em> is not built on new research findings, but Harris has read widely, and he has assembled his tower of public sources to present an unsettling vantage on California, the place where he claims capitalism truly became global. His candid and polemical style is an asset most of the time. If you already share his general outlook, it’s cathartic to watch him rip with gusto into California’s most villainous disruptors. If you don’t, occasional passages of <em>Palo Alto</em> will feel smug or even condescending. In his desire for an all-encompassing Marxist sweep, Harris risks replicating the sort of flippant grand narrativizing that drives so much Silicon Valley rhetoric—a penchant that Stanford literary scholar Adrian Daub examines in his pithy and lucid book <em><a href=""https://dispatchesmag.com/review-what-tech-calls-thinking/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">What Tech Calls Thinking</a></em>. But a place as hubris-saturated as California deserves a big and audacious critique to match, and here <em>Palo Alto</em> succeeds at full volume.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The organizing theme of the book—the reason the Santa Clara Valley yields more than just crops—appears when Harris examines railroad baron Leland Stanford. Not long before Leland co-founded Stanford University, he built the Palo Alto Stock Farm and transformed the breeding of racehorses:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Capital’s exigencies dictated that Palo Alto shorten the horse production cycle. That meant training the animals to trot younger rather than letting colts learn to walk before they run. Instead of optimizing for adult speed, they optimized for <em>visible potential</em>... The stock farm’s regimen of capitalist rationality and the exclusive focus on potential and speculative value was called the Palo Alto System and it worked.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Facebook popularized the move-fast-and-break-things philosophy in our time, but Leland Stanford had already laid the track by the end of the 1880s, and his stock farm embodied that philosophy literally. As contemporary horse racing expert Leslie Macleod wrote about Stanford’s treatment of horses, “you must not be surprised if some tendon snaps... Some good material has without a doubt been spoiled.” The Palo Alto System is the drive to optimization, applied to living beings as early and incessantly as possible. Stanford’s ideological successors have extended this approach to everyone and everything in sight. In the spirit of colonialism, they made the leap from optimizing horses to optimizing the entire world.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">“[Palo Alto’s] biggest export, more than code, circuit design, and marketing fluff, is human capital,” Harris writes. “Stanford switched from colts to young people, but it was still a breeding and training project.” The model, he concludes, is “progress by victory, defeat, and ruthless elimination, full speed from day one.” His book presents the horrific outcomes of this one-or-zero vision. The earliest include the development of IQ tests and other eugenics-related fads at Stanford University, as well as Stanford alum Herbert Hoover’s wildly successful nourishing of callous corporate cabals. Among the most recent: the rise of a venture capital culture that “made every enterprise into a binary bet,” a workforce intensely bifurcated by class and race, and the winner-take-all ethos that’s dominated Silicon Valley’s schools and driven unusually high youth suicide rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the crux of Harris’s story is found in the postwar: the period when Palo Alto “went straight from rural to something like postindustrial,” when Silicon Valley grew into its namesake and began to dominate the globe. A flood of military funding buoyed Stanford University, and the school helped fill the needs of a country “finished with peace altogether, a nation that has embraced a permanent conflict.” As Harris summarizes the Cold War, “America’s life-or-death race with the Soviets was about which side could assimilate the global South into its circuits of production and consumption.” Companies in Stanford’s orbit led the pack, pioneering corporate offshoring to exploit workers abroad as well as at home. The defense contracting of the 1950s and ‘60s became the war capitalism of the ‘70s and Reaganite ‘80s. Some of the very first laptops in existence, built by a spin-off of Palo Alto-based Xerox PARC, were used by lieutenant colonel Oliver North and his infamous Iran-Contra network.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early on Harris writes, “What interests me is not so much the personal qualities of the men and women in this history but how capitalism has made use of them. To think about life this way is not to surrender to predetermination; only by understanding how we’re made use of can we start to distinguish our selves from our situations.” Nearly six hundred pages later, he proposes the return of Stanford University’s land and assets to Indigenous stewardship, in particular to the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, whose members descend from several Bay Area tribal groups. His vision of Stanford as a center for the “twenty-first-century Indigenous-led movement to protect the biosphere” is moving. It must be emphasized when discussing decolonization, particularly in California, that within the state’s borders are dozens of distinct tribal communities with extremely varied cultures and relationships to place. Specificity is central. And the greater the efforts toward decolonization, the more vital it will be to look beyond the depersonalizing method Harris often uses to understand capitalism’s history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Palo Alto</em> deserves many readers—not only those who already share Harris’s political views, but also those who remain bewildered that operators like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel could amass so much power. And it should be a clarifying read for anyone who is affiliated with tech but feels vaguely uneasy about its effects on society. On any given day circa Obama’s second term, I would walk the Stanford campus and see an alarming percentage of undergrads wearing free t-shirts that advertised the war-and-surveillance profiteer Palantir, who at the time were headquartered only a short walk away. If at least a few engineers look askance at their old Palantir swag after picking up a copy of <em>Palo Alto</em>, Harris will have done a public service.</p>

Berkeley is, of course, where Oppenheimer made his reputation as one of the the world's leading theoretical physicists and teachers of physics.

<p id=""Wasserman""><strong><em>Oppenheimer</em> a masterpiece? </strong>No. The “best, most important film of this century” (Paul Schrader)? Emphatically not. A lot of history packed into three hours, yes. You’d do well to read Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s exemplary biography <em><a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/13787/american-prometheus-by-kai-bird-and-martin-sherwin/"">American Prometheus</a></em> beforehand to make sense of the tsunami of characters that flash and flicker by. Or watch Jon Else's superb 1981 documentary <em>The Day After Trinity</em>, with a script by David and Janet Peoples (now streaming on <a href=""https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-day-after-trinity"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">The Criterion Channel</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan, the director of <em>Oppenheimer</em>, doesn’t trust the inherent drama to speak for itself and bludgeons us with a relentless and deafening score by Ludwig Göransson that tells us what to think at every turn, overwhelming the actors whose performances are (mostly) superb. I was, I confess, also disappointed by the disobliging depiction of&nbsp;Oppenheimer’s lovers as little more than Commie temptresses whose politics were both fashionable and frivolous. (Minor quibble: My friend Eric Alterman points out that an early scene has&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;and his left-wing girlfriend erroneously attributing the famous crack that ""property is theft"" to Marx in his three-volume tome <em>Das Kapital</em>, when in fact it was written by the anarchist Proudhon.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some viewers may find that Nolan ""glorifies""&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;(and scientists more generally) by concentrating on his moral torments rather than on the victims of his diabolical invention. I didn't mind Nolan using&nbsp;Oppenheimer's odyssey to vivify the tragic paradox that the very man who had done so much to create the atom bomb, impelled by the race to deny the Nazis such a doomsday weapon, also came to understand that the mass murder of upwards of 200,000 innocent Japanese civilians had profound implications for unleashing an existential arms race that might well incinerate the planet and lead to the extinction of our (and all) species. Whether Nolan successfully realizes that ambition in his clamorous picture and whether his choice to omit pictures of the devastation visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki morally compromises his film, can be debated. And should be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For my money, John Adams’s and Peter Sellars’s opera <em>Doctor Atomic</em> (2005) does a superior job of realizing and exploring the moral conundrums that plagued&nbsp;Oppenheimer. Even better is the all-but-forgotten seven-hour miniseries the BBC mounted in 1980 on&nbsp;Oppenheimer, starring Sam Waterston, produced by Peter Goodchild, with an Emmy Award-winning script by Peter Prince. (It can be watched for free <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxmsxMjFwFQ&amp;list=PLkySUcuC83-7kKMNggMu9kWuWXFqN4EUe"">on YouTube</a>.) It’s a tour de force and arguably the unacknowledged template for Nolan's effort nearly a half-century later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cillian Murphy plays&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;first as gob-smacked by the Cosmos and then later equally gob-smacked by his own naïveté and the Machiavellian efforts by others to do him in. Strangely starry-eyed and slack-jawed throughout. And, ultimately, opaque and unknowable, which may really have accurately reflected the essence of the man. He always presented himself as a man of high principle never confessing to low ambition, the epitome of someone seeking to have it both ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spoiler alert: A nearly unrecognizable Robert Downey, Jr. almost steals the picture as&nbsp;Oppenheimer's persecutor who stops at nothing to sacrifice&nbsp;Oppenheimer&nbsp;on the altar of his own ambition.</p>

<p id=""Aylward""><strong>The difference between Christopher Nolan’s</strong> “history” films and his “time” films is the difference between history and time. History is told to us. Time is experienced. A filmmaker can play with time; he can only adapt history. Nolan’s time is abstract; his history consists of&nbsp; connecting the dots. That his most recent “time” film,<em> Tenet</em>&nbsp; (2020), did a better job of exploring a central theme of his new “history” film, <em>Oppenheimer</em>, is because <em>Tenet</em> met that nearly clichéd criterion of good cinema: the “what” of the story was consonant with the “how.” Nolan’s far-fetched thematic premise of grappling with the future consequences of past decisions in the present was entertainingly matched with far-fetched directorial decisions, like scene blockings that feature actors propelled forwards and backwards. On the other hand, <em>Oppenheimer</em>, as Dave Ehrlich observes in IndieWire, “suffers from an irreconcilable disconnect between form and function.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, much has been said for and against Nolan’s depiction of the climactic Trinity test of the atomic bomb—I actually liked it cutting to silence when the bomb explodes, if only because extended sequences of silence are few and far between in cinema today—Hollywood or otherwise. But the sight gag of Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) bolted to a lawn chair and slathered in sun protection dragged the scene back into the bog of historical adaptation. That Teller actually did this does not lessen the ridiculousness of the image. Ehrlich writes that “Nolan doesn’t know how to dramatize what he doesn’t know.” Indeed, Nolan resorts to twisting screensaver-like visualisations when J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) gets a scientific notion or is handed a newspaper with a historic headline. A Jimmy Neutron brain blast is a better depiction of intellectual ideation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of intellectual inspiration there is a 25-second montage within the film’s first ten minutes during which we see Oppenheimer reading T.S. Eliot’s <em>The Waste Land</em>, dropping a gramophone needle on Stravinsky’s <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, and walking by Ivan Vasilievich Kliun’s Cubist painting <em>The Clockmaker</em> in a museum. This sequence is set while the young scientist is on a study tour of Europe in the mid-1920s, and it culminates in a short staring contest between Oppenheimer and Picasso’s <a href=""https://www.museepicassoparis.fr/en/collection-en-ligne#/artwork/160000000000689?filters=year%3A111937%E2%86%B91937&amp;page=1&amp;layout=grid&amp;sort=by_author""><em>Femme assise aux bras croisés</em></a>. Here Nolan does some time bending, as Picasso did not make the painting until 1937. Yet in the context of the three hours that follow, this awkward, but oddly touching, encounter between the scientist and the painting is likely the director’s amateur psychologizing. A woman's gaze will figure prominently in his life, most poignantly in his tragic lover, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and his loyal but troubled wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), who are both convincingly portrayed, despite every effort on the part of Nolan’s directing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can infer that these encounters with modern art generally informed Oppenheimer’s theoretical physics, which is initially portrayed as physics for its own sake, whereby he shirks a traditional training in mathematics like an artist who forgoes training in figure drawing. What was underexplored in the film—yet I think critical to understanding the construction of the bomb and the moral quandaries that followed—was exactly how Oppenheimer conceived of his transition from “doing science” to “making bombs” in real time. Instead, the U.S. government suddenly appears in the form of Colonel Leslie R. Groves (Matt Damon) and the theoretical at once gives way to the applied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her influential writing on the form of the grid in 20th century art—a tendency that emerged in the sort of Cubist paintings Oppenheimer might have seen—Rosalind Krauss observes that the grid had successfully “wall[ed] the visual arts into a realm of exclusive visuality.” The grid’s rejection of narrative and its clear discontinuity from 19th century art results in work that is “at once autonomous and autotelic”—its purpose is as a visual representation of itself (think Piet Mondrian, Agnes Martin, or Barnett Newman). Yet Krauss also points out the grid’s “mythic power,” in which a purely material, almost mathematical, structure can take on greater significance.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This direction of travel is the strength of <em>Tenet</em> while the inverse is <em>Oppenheimer’s</em> weakness<em>. </em>Both are about nuclear warfare, but the former is an ahistorical experiment that in practical execution leads us toward some insight into unwitting decisions that return to haunt us (Nolan hints at climate change). <em>Oppenheimer</em> assumes its mythic power immediately with heavy-handed references to Prometheus and the <em>Bhagavad</em>-<em>Gita</em> and devolves into a paint-by-numbers procedural drama. Clear-eyed statements are helpfully facilitated by flashbacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>T.S. Eliot, who spent two months in 1948 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where Oppenheimer, having left Berkeley and Los Alamos, was now director, wrote that “it is as much, or more, because of what we do piecemeal without understanding or foreseeing the consequences, that the culture of one age differs from that of its predecessor.” I wonder if the two men ever talked about this. Even if they did, it’s not in Christopher Nolan’s new film.</p>

<p id=""OBrien""><strong>I'm not sure if a film about Oppenheimer</strong> can or even needs to capture everything about Oppenheimer. I'm more interested in Nolan's decision to use Lewis Strauss's 1959 nomination for Secretary of Commerce as one of the film's narrative arcs alongside&nbsp;Oppenheimer's security hearing four years earlier (which Strauss orchestrated). As someone who didn't know about these intertwined events, I thought Nolan's suspenseful union of the nomination and security hearing served as an excellent—and original—frame for a story about&nbsp;Oppenheimer's role at Los Alamos&nbsp;(senate hearings are, after all, in vogue).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why do we need to see all the worn out images of a destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki—again? That so much of the discussion about the film has centered on its omission of these images of destruction—as if their cinematic rehashing is some kind of prerequisite for virtuous storytelling—is more reflective of the way a piece of art today must attempt to atone for the sins it represents, especially if these sins are historical. But atonement, when a box needs to be checked, does not make for interesting art. Father, forgive us our bombs. . .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What if we instead talked about Nolan's depiction of&nbsp;Oppenheimer's visions in the second half of the film of obliterated corpses and warped surroundings. Are these depictions of the matter in Oppenheimer's troubled conscience—by a Jew, no less, with real stakes in the fight against the Nazis—too subtle to save the film from ""moral compromise""? The film tracks, judiciously, Lewis's nomination and Oppenheimer's hearing, and I think a more challenging debate could be: How does Nolan treat these particular events and&nbsp;flashbacks? What does Nolan get right? What does he miss? I thought his treatment of Strauss (and Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar portrayal of Strauss) was brilliant, compelling, and unusual. And yes, Göransson's score is a bit heavy-handed, but so is a warhead.</p>

<p id=""Hewitt""><strong>At his best, Christopher Nolan understands</strong> that cinema and spectacle are fundamentally intertwined. From the proto-documentaries of the Lumière brothers to the dreamlike fantasias of Georges Méliès, films have presented reality and illusion side by side from the very beginning, providing entertainment that is simultaneously larger-than-life and profoundly intimate. Cinema is unique as an art form in its ability to awe through the sheer spectacle of its imagery. That’s why it’s so odd that Nolan, a director known as much for his staggering visuals as his toying with chronology, seems to have turned his back on his most spectacular instincts in <em>Oppenheimer</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three-hour, dialogue-driven epic is nothing if not propulsive. Featuring career-topping performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., the film is surprisingly pacey for what—with one obvious exception—amounts to scene after scene of scientists talking. Overlapping timelines and Jennifer Lame’s snappy editing keep things moving, at times breathlessly. But in appeasing Nolan’s obsession with practical filmmaking and eschewing CGI, the movie sacrifices its visual climax for analog credentials.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start with the technical details. As with all of Nolan’s films since <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008), <em>Oppenheimer</em> was shot on IMAX cameras (and marketed accordingly). It’s certainly a quirk of the director’s style that <em>Oppenheimer</em> can only be seen as intended—<a href=""https://imaxmelbourne.com.au/about_imax/imax-1570-film/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">on 15-perf 70mm film</a>—in thirty cinemas worldwide. But with negatives nearly triple the size of the next largest film stock, Nolan’s fixation on the IMAX Experience® is understandable, especially given his penchant for spectacle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet <em>Oppenheimer </em>contains relatively little 15-perf footage. Perhaps a quarter of the film fills the 8-story IMAX screen, with the rest retreating to letterboxed 65mm. Compare this with <em>Tenet</em> (2020) or <em>Dunkirk</em> (2017), each of which spent over half of their runtimes in full-frame IMAX. Those films—an involuted action thriller and an elaborately constructed wartime drama—at first seem more obvious targets for spectacle than an introspective portrait of a philandering scientist. And in producing a script so reliant on dialogue, Nolan may have backed himself into a corner: IMAX cameras are notoriously loud, making dialogue recording difficult. But if any of the director’s films deserved the full IMAX treatment, it is this one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robert Oppenheimer was more than just a brilliant physicist with a complicated past. He was instrumental in what colleague Ernest O. Lawrence called “<a href=""https://www.osti.gov/opennet/manhattan-project-history/images/lawrence_trinity.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the greatest single event in the history of mankind</a>.” Regardless of how effectively Nolan delves into Oppenheimer’s inner life, his complex relationships, his public trials and private tribulations, the climax remains something larger than him or any of the other scientists involved: the Trinity test—the literal dawn of the atomic age.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With an epoch-defining, Promethean moment at its center, <em>Oppenheimer</em> should leverage cinema’s unique capability for spectacle by any means necessary. But Nolan’s insistence on practical effects limits the scope of his reenactment. As viewers, we know the outcome of the tightly-edited, pulse-pounding ignition sequence. We know the bomb works. We know the atmosphere does not ignite. So, when the countdown reaches zero, we know what to expect: a massive explosion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet that expectation—and the film’s visual climax—fails to live up to reality. No traditional explosive, however creatively shot, can convey the spectacular frisson of nuclear detonation. Anyone who has seen high-speed footage of an atomic test knows that a nuclear fireball looks like nothing else. In the moments after ignition, an atomic cascade begins, x-rays blasting outward, forming a blotchy, uneven star, its mottled surface emitting light and heat multiple times greater than the sun. A supersonic shock wave follows, moving so rapidly it causes the air around the fireball to glow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2901,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2901""/><figcaption>Still from ""Atomic Filmmakers: Behind the Scenes,"" 1999. YouTube. </figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite these self-imposed practical limitations, the ignition sequence remains a highlight of the film, not least because it’s one of the few almost entirely in IMAX. But divorced from the alien experience of witnessing quantum effects play out on a macroscopic scale, it becomes yet another cinematic mushroom cloud—a cliché that reaches for awe but ultimately disperses, a short-lived radioactive half-life in our collective conscience. In fact, nothing in <em>Oppenheimer</em> evokes quite the sense of dread of <em>Dunkirk</em>’s dock scenes (in which trapped soldiers, crammed onto piers, look up as German aircraft engines roar), or the grandeur of the supermassive black hole in <em>Interstellar</em> (2014). This latter sequence, employing a relativistic 3D model that inspired its own scientific research, makes Nolan’s reluctance to use CGI in <em>Oppenheimer</em> even stranger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At times, the director’s deference pays off. When Oppenheimer describes his haunting “visions of a hidden universe,” Hoyte van Hoytema’s macro photography brilliantly illustrates the weirdness of the quantum world. Arcing bands of light, nodules of burning thermite, and swelling particle seas flash across the screen in glorious full-frame IMAX. But when it comes to Trinity itself, the impracticality of practical effects becomes apparent. The same can be said of Oppenheimer’s ensuing visions of nuclear annihilation. Following Hiroshima’s destruction, he imagines the white light of Trinity tearing the skin from a woman’s face. But the effect is unconvincing, looking more like peeling latex than flash-fried flesh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his earnest desire to nurture and protect the craft of filmmaking, Nolan neglects the unambiguous fear and unbridled awe that nuclear weapons ought to elicit. Without a faithful representation of the weapon at its thematic center, <em>Oppenheimer</em> comes across as a powerful movie about a brilliant man’s contradictions, rather than a jarring, terrifying testimony to the world he helped create.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Spectacle is often derided in critical circles. But to represent the power of nuclear weapons, nothing could be more appropriate. Spectacular visuals offer chances for personal interpretation that exposition-laden dialogue is incapable of. Ultimately, by insisting on “real” special effects, the film minimizes the only unequivocal message one ought to draw from the father of the atomic bomb: that nuclear weapons remain the single most horrifying—and yet mesmerizing—product of humanity’s imaginations.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>IN JULY 1954, THE NINTH SUMMER AFTER THE WAR,</strong> Malcolm Cowley was winding up <em>The Literary Situation</em>, his appraisal of life and letters in the U.S. at the mid-century, with a look to the future. The chapter was titled “The Next Fifty Years in American Literature.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A poet in his youth, Cowley dropped out of Harvard during the Great War to volunteer as an ambulance driver for the French army. In the 1920s, he joined the pilgrimage of his Greenwich Village cadre to Paris, where, fellow voyager of Hart Crane, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Dos Passos, he edited little magazines and consorted with Dadaists. With the publication of <em>Exile’s Return</em> in 1934, Cowley emerged as the leading chronicler of the Lost Generation, a role he maintained until his death in 1989.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a Popular Front phase in the ‘30s, when he was editing the back of the book at the <em>New Republic</em>, Cowley began a legendary association with the Viking Press in the ‘40s, scouting talent and editing volumes for its Portable Library. His introduction to the <em>Portable Hemingway</em> (1944) presented readers a Hemingway for the ‘40s—not as a keen-eyed naturalist transcribing the world, nor as a brawny adventurer, school of Jack London (although Cowley bolstered that myth himself with a heroizing piece in <em>Life</em> magazine), but as a writer whose closest kin were Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville, “the haunted and nocturnal writers, the men who dealt in images that were symbols of an inner world.” It was a startling reappraisal of a figure who had been world-famous for decades, yet would become standard. (Hemingway told his friend Colonel Buck Lanham that Cowley was the best critic writing in the U.S.) In 1946 Cowley published the <em>Portable Faulkner</em>, a well-timed intervention that helped rescue the novelist from near oblivion (the Nobel Prize committee took heed).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Literary Situation</em> briskly takes account of the pretensions of the New Critics (“The New Age of the Rhetoricians”), the paperback revolution (“Cheap Books for the Millions”), the war novels, and other up-to-date matters. An extended “Natural History of the American Writer” traces the species from childhood pursuits to earnings, dress (dark shirts and gray flannel were typical), work habits (including smoking) and domestic habitats, which for the “average” writer would be somewhere within a hundred miles of New York. Since 1931 Cowley and his wife, Muriel, had lived in a converted barn in Sherman, Connecticut, sixty miles from Midtown Manhattan, America’s Grub Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1954 the most turbulent part of the immediate Postwar had passed. The air was clearer, saner. China was “lost,” the Russians had the bomb (something Harry Truman never expected), but even so the fever dream of McCarthyism was breaking up: its alcoholic eponym would be censured by the Senate in the next year. Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic Party’s once-and-future candidate for president and no firebrand himself, conceded that “moderation is the spirit of the times.” It was thus in a becalmed season that Cowley surveyed the American scene with an eye to the vast changes that had occurred in the last half century, had accelerated during and just after the war, and now seemed to be settling into a pattern unexpectedly bland and desperately decorous. Some broad observations:</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Demographic</em>: “The population of the country had doubled in my lifetime: the increase was from 76 million in 1900 to 151 million in 1950.... In proportion to the total population there were more women in 1950, when they first outnumbered the men; there were more persons over sixty and many more white-collar workers, while the numbers of farmers and miners had decreased absolutely as well as relatively. More of the new Americans were living in Michigan, Florida, Texas, and on the Pacific Coast, where the population had been growing faster than elsewhere in the country; all four regions, but especially California, were playing a larger part in literature. In some of the prairie states, the population wasn’t growing at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In almost all the metropolitan areas”—there were 168, as defined by the Census, each boasting at least one city with a population of 50,000 or more—“the suburbs were growing faster than the cities, many of which were standing still.” Unlike anomic urbanites, “The new Americans lived outside the city in communities where they knew their neighbors by name and tried to win their approval. ‘People like people,’ said William Levitt, ‘that’s been our experience,’ speaking for himself and his brother.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was also the Levitts’ experience—literally, their prejudice—that white people didn’t want Black people for neighbors. Levittowns—the archetypal postwar “developments”—were effectively closed to African-Americans. (Hispanics and Asians barely figured on the scene outside the Pacific Coast and the thinly populated Southwest, but they would have been unwanted too.) But then, the genteel Progressive Era streetcar suburbs from Ditmas Park in Brooklyn to the Elmwood District in Berkeley were in practice no less exclusive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some time in 1948 the balance in what had been an urban nation since 1920 subtly shifted, as the percentage of Americans living in cities of 100,000 or more was outnumbered by those living in the spreading suburbs; the national ambience was going from thronged city streets to tranquil suburban lanes. As opposed to the jarring inequality of the city, material life in the suburban nation was strikingly egalitarian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Everyone seemed to be middle class and literate, no matter his trade,” Cowley reports of a season spent in Seattle in 1950. “We lived on a street lined with picture-windowed houses that were owned, not rented, by business people, skilled mechanics, and college professors. The milkman, the dry cleaner for the neighborhood, and the cleaner’s wife were college graduates, as were many of the taxi drivers. There was no longer the gulf that threatened to open in the 1920s between the white-collar classes and men in overalls.” To the contrary, the white-collar worker had slightly fallen in status and prosperity, while “manual workers had risen, both socially and economically; often they had moved into the same streets as the white-collar people and were driving bigger cars.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Physiognomic</em>: “The physical type was changing along with the social character. Americans were taller than their parents of the same sex, with broader shoulders, deeper chests, narrower hips, and longer legs. Though quicker and more agile, they seem to have less physical endurance; they didn’t excel in marathon races or cross-country skiing.” The rising generation walked less because they were driving cars more; for exercise, or so Cowley says, apparently from observing his son Robert’s friends, they liked a short speedy swim followed by sunbathing on the beach. “One pictured a new race built like herons, with slender legs not designed for walking or climbing, but merely for standing in shallow water.” These notes are more school of Strabo than Darwin, but they don’t stray too far from the empirical mark; people were growing taller and were differently built; and thanks to the new aluminum-based deodorants they even smelled different from their sweaty forebears, or so Gore Vidal maintains somewhere.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Climatic</em>: “The climate was changing, though no one knew how long the process would continue.” This was prescient. In 1946-47 Europe endured the coldest winter since the Middle Ages. To the amazement of botanists, forests were springing up in the bombed-out cities. Wolves were seen on the road from Rome to Naples. But while Europe was enduring the big chill, New York City experienced a historic heat wave. Truman Capote wrote of an August day when “the heat closed in like a hand over a murder victim’s mouth, the city thrashed and twisted.” Along with the television set, the inexpensive window air-conditioner was just about to become a familiar domestic appliance, but the toils of summertime in the city still sped the exodus to the chiller suburbs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Environmental</em>: “The land itself was changing as its inhabitants were redistributed around the metropolitan centers and along the radiating superhighways. Away from the highways and summer resorts, broad sections of the country were poorer and emptier than they had been in 1900.” An improved “standard of living” came at the cost of environmental degradation. What was once prosperous farmland, as in Westchester County, New York, had been paved, condemned, and excavated to build housing tracts or light-industry, or converted into “airfields, golf links, parking-lots, drive-in theaters, and automobile junkyards.” Along with the despoliation of the landscape came the exhaustion of natural resources: “part of the price for winning World War II had been the iron ore of the Mesabi Range.”</p>

<p>Hibbing, Minnesota, a town of a few thousand set in the Mesabi (a district, not a hilly or mountainous place) had been one of the busiest extractive sites in the world during the war. “Again, let me allude to the tranquility, the remote sylvan calm of this area,” John Gunther wrote in his mammoth survey, <em>Inside U.S.A.</em> (1947). “Then reflect that this is the essential heart of the steel industry of the United States.” Hibbing’s distinguishing feature was an open pit proudly advertised by locals as “the biggest hole ever built by man.” Here, Robert Allen Zimmerman, familiarly Bobby Zimmerman, later Bob Dylan, born in 1941 in neighboring Duluth, moved with his family in 1947 and grew up, amid the greenery and the slag.</p>

<p>“He felt he didn’t fit in, not in Hibbing,” Echo Star Helstrom, the girl from the North Country, told his first biographer, Anthony Scaduto. “I remember, during the time we were together, he would drive down to Minneapolis and come back and tell me how great everybody was down there. ‘Everybody’s with it, down there,’ he’d say. ‘It’s so different from Hibbing. They <em>understand</em>.’”</p>

<p>Few spans in American history have received such mixed notices as the years from 1945 to c. 1974, although in view of what followed, some historians have taken to calling this interval the golden age, or in France, “the thirty golden years.” It was a time of distant conflicts, widely diffused prosperity, and declining inequality, but also, especially at the start, of “containment”— psychological no less than geopolitical.</p>

<p>One historian’s <em>Proud Decades</em> is another’s <em>Dark Ages</em>. What might be called the disputed years begin at the beginning, V-J Day, August 14, 1945. Popular chroniclers, even historians who offer more complex takes elsewhere, reflexively recall V-J as joyous, even “ecstatic,” although it was surely not that for everybody: not for the bereft mourning while others rejoiced. As told by Eric F. Goldman in <em>The Crucial Decade: America, 1945-1955</em>—the first summing-up of time and place by a respectably tenured academic—the celebration of victory over Japan roared cross-country, from waylaid trolley cars in Los Angeles, snake-dancing in staid Salt Lake City, to a night-and-day, day-and-night revel in New York City which at its peak packed two million people into Times Square; the triumphant bulletins on the New York Times building’s electric “zipper” sent up cheers that echoed from the Hudson to the East River. “Americans had quite a celebration,” Goldman recalled,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">and yet, in a way, the celebration never really rang true. People were gay, so determinedly gay. The nation was a carnival but the festivities, as a reporter wrote from Chicago, ""didn’t seem like so much."" It was such a peculiar peace. ... And everybody talked of ""the end of the war,"" not of victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">No such muted tones for Marty Jezer, almost forty years later, whose <em>Dark Ages: Life in the United States, 1945- 1960</em>, conjures August 14 in New York City as a contrast between the vast crowd mindlessly celebrating in Times Square—the oblivious “Squares” who might still have been mourning the big band-leader Glenn Miller, lost in a flight over the English Channel in December 1944—and the knowing hepcats jamming at the Three Deuces, “a small cavernous cellar joint on 52nd Street,” where Charlie Parker was playing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Who,” writes Jezer, “on that most wonderful of all summer nights, would have imagined that this black bopster genius (and not the celebrants dancing, cheering, kissing, hugging, and winding their way through tons of confetti in long, exuberant conga lines) was attuned to the future, and that his apocalyptic nightmare vision of the American dream was a vision of a world to come.” But it’s unlikely that all that many of the crowd merry-making in Times Square would find the ‘50s so nightmarish; for that matter, Bird’s repertoire in August 1945, which included “Lester Steps In,” was hardly an agonized wail, or at least doesn’t register like one now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Over all the victory celebrations,” says Goldman, “the fact of the atomic bomb hung like some eerie haze from another world.” As of that summer night the apocalypse had already come and gone, with details straight out of the Book of Revelations. Europe, said Churchill, was “a rubble heap, a charnel house, a breeding ground of pestilence and hate.” From Monte Cassino and Dresden, Berlin and the Baltic sea, the devastation extended across Eurasia to Manila, with the advance and retreat of vast armies leading to the greatest forced migrations in history, climaxing with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This brutal tearing at the urban fabric of the World Island was not just the background but the precondition of American supremacy, which by the end of the war had left the U.S. at the “summit of the world” (Churchill). It also confirmed New York as the “capital of the 20th century,” ultimate refuge of avant-gardes and scholars fled from <em>Mitteleuropa</em>, the bastion of capital in a world turning socialist, and a Mecca for the ambitious young of all nations.</p>

<p>James T. Patterson’s <em>Grand Expectations: United States, 1945-1974</em>, is a worthy chronicle of the golden age, laden with the authority of being an Oxford history: Its scope is enormous, its judgments rarely surprise or provoke. And, yet, how consistently in the Postwar was history shaped less by “grand expectations” than by expectations frustrated and disappointed!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grandest of failed expectations from which almost all the significant others would follow was demographic. The vulgarly named “baby boom,” whose numbers would overcrowd the scene in the 1940s and seize the stage in the ‘60s, came as almost a complete surprise to everyone, including those who were busy procreating. David Riesman's <em>The Lonely Crowd</em>, the most famous work of sociology to come out of the ‘40s, was premised on the idea that population growth was slowing and headed to a decline. The crowd would be lonelier because it would be fewer. In this expectation Riesman and his colleagues echoed what had been the conventional wisdom among demographers—always the last to know—since Herbert Hoover commissioned a voluminous statistical study of American society, <em>Recent Social Trends</em> (1933), which projected that the U.S. population would peak at 150 million around 1970, if not sooner, and begin to fall. “The birth rate has been declining in the United States since 1810,” the report concluded, “hence it seems more likely that it will continue to decline until 1970, rather than becoming stationary in 1945, as the maximum [hypothesis] assumes.” That the birth rate would actually dramatically <em>increase</em> after 1945 and remain at a historically high level until 1964 was too fanciful even to consider.</p>

<p class=""indentedd"">Tracing an S-shaped curve through history, from ancient traditional societies in which birth and death rates are high and stable, to the population explosion that began in Europe in the 17th century, to the present, Riesman identifies the corresponding ideal character types. In a traditional society, character was formed by rules and routines and rituals learned in childhood and rigidly reinforced by society throughout life. Such, Riesman writes, was the case in Europe until the end of the Middle Ages, and so it remained in 1950 “among such enormously different types of people as Hindus and Hopi Indians, Zulus and Chinese, North African Arabs and Balinese.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The extraordinary increase in population in Europe between 1650 and 1900 occurred at the same time that it was forcibly imposing its civilization abroad. Emerging during the Renaissance and Reformation was a new “inner-directed” character adapted to conquest (“exploration, colonization, and imperialism”), and novel occupational niches at home. Norms and goals “implanted early in life by the elders,” suggests Riesman, keep the conquistadors and the Mr. Gradgrinds “on course,” (so to speak) like an internal gyroscope, even when they are far from home or removed from familiar routines. Thus, Riesman might have noticed, the ideal type flourished in English literature from Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe to Conrad’s Mr. Kurtz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The prospect of “incipient population decline,” associated with advanced industrial societies, explains a new type of American character, the “other-directed.” At mid-century the other-directed seemed to be “emerging in very recent years in the upper middle-class of our larger cities: more prominent in New York than in Boston, in Los Angeles than in Spokane, in Cincinnati than in Chillicothe”; its most conspicuous members were teenagers, a cohort only recently identified as such in the New York Times Magazine. Young and old, the other-directed were adapted to a society of consumption rather than rapacious accumulation, of leisure rather than hard labor. But the other-directed young especially would be attuned not to ancestral voices but to their “peers,” in the flesh and in the burgeoning media of the mid-century (paperbacks, comic books, jukeboxes, movies, and so on). If their remoter ancestors had spun like tops in their colonial outposts or crushing occupations, the other-directed were like radar dishes, forever attuned to incoming signals. The exemplar here was Holden Caulfield, who in his fictional life would have been a contemporary in the “real” lives of John Updike, Susan Sontag, Philip Roth, and Leonard Michaels, all born in 1932-1933. Holden’s teenaged Midtown Manhattan odyssey in <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> is exactly dated to the winter of 1950.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Riesman, let it be noted, was not so far off in his anatomy of the changing American character; what he got wrong was the numbers, and that would make all the difference, beginning with the signals sent and received in the country of the young.</p>

<p>The Postwar begins by confounding “conventional wisdom” (John Kenneth Galbraith’s useful phrase, not yet coined). Everyone from the New York intellectuals like Delmore Schwartz, who anticipated the novelties and sensations of another Jazz Age, to the Republican politicos (and not a few conservative Democrats), who fondly believed that with the magus-like FDR out of the picture the New Deal would be repealed, to the demographers who got it wrong—all had something to rue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The never-New Dealers took heart from a widespread presentiment that the nation’s political and social center of gravity was about to be restored to the Midwest, where it belonged. FDR’s unprepossessing successor, the “accidental” Harry S. Truman, was himself a son of the Middle Border who, despite repeated failures in the private sector, retained the prejudices of a small-town businessman. Coming after FDR, Harry Truman would be, Alice Roosevelt Longworth predicted, like a glass of milk chasing a dose of Benzedrine. From the strike wave of 1946 and the war scare of ‘48, through the witch-hunting (encouraged by his attorney general’s infamous list of alleged subversive organizations), the atomic-bomb-rattling, and the Korean War in 1950, Truman’s administration turned out to be one of the most nerve-wracking in modern history. If the majestic FDR had seemed equal to anything history threw at him, Truman, as the young John Updike said, gave the impression of an unnerved riverboat gambler. Yet, Truman was elected president in his own right in 1948, despite a three-way-split in the Democratic Party; the New Deal was (modestly) enlarged, under Truman and his Republican successor, Eisenhower, a politically canny general promoted out of obscurity during the war by FDR.</p>

<p>“There was never a time in American life when private life was so much more attractive than public life,” Cowley sums up. Not so paradoxically, the prevailing egalitarianism was not inconsistent with hedgerows and high fences for those who could afford a place in the country, since the schools and the television set were setting the standards for instruction and entertainment. Inevitably, Tocqueville makes an appearance, having perceived a century before “a sort of enormous pressure of the mind of all upon the individual intelligence.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than resuming the glitter and excess of the ‘20s, “the first and (perhaps the only) modern decade,” according to the historian John Lukacs, the ‘50s restrained excess and shunned display. “It was characteristic of the Jazz Age that it had no interest in politics at all,” Fitzgerald said, conclusively. But the Jazz Age was a society of spectacles, the greatest since Rome in the first two centuries AD, when, above and beyond the gory contests in the Colosseum, the Romans indulged a passion for drama in vast amphitheaters, chorales boasting thousands of singers, and well-attended public readings that made celebrities of Tacitus and Pliny the Younger. The ‘50s in the U.S. was not without spectacle, typically sporting events; but baseball and football, wrestling and boxing were now viewed at long distance at home, while attendance in person was an atavistic thrill, most gorily at boxing matches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Significantly, and again mysteriously, the public had begun deserting the splendiferous movie palaces of the ‘20s <em>in advance</em> of national TV broadcasting, as if craving the private spells that the ghostly new medium would afford them. Visiting L.A. at mid-century, the Spanish philosopher Julián Marías was amazed by the limitless sea of houses. “When one is in a residential area, for miles around there is nothing other than homes,” he wrote with evident horror. Yet he needed only to wait for night to peer into the picture windows to see the phosphor glow that connected them. Only <em>apparently</em> turned in on themselves, the houses were little domestic monads linked by the “preordained harmony of television.”</p>

<p>In 1960 Norman Mailer had a different sort of epiphany in Los Angeles while he was covering the Democratic convention for Esquire: the revelation of charisma. A day found him waiting for the arrival of Jack Kennedy on a balcony of the Biltmore Hotel opposite Pershing Square, in L.A.’s notional downtown, “the three-hundred- and-sixty-five days-a-year convention of every junkie, pot-head, pusher, and queen.” The candidate arrives in a convertible, observed by a scrum of television cameras. Mailer writes:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">One saw him immediately. He had the deep orange-brown suntan of a ski instructor, and when he smiled at the crowd his teeth were amazingly white and clearly visible at a distance of fifty yards. For one moment he saluted Pershing Square, and Pershing Square saluted him back, the prince and the beggars of glamour staring at one another across a city street, one of those very special moments in the underground history of the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Having wondered why the convention seemed so depressed, Mailer realized it was because the Democrats were preparing to nominate a candidate with the aura of a movie star, “and the consequences of that were staggering.” But this mysterious stranger, as Jack Kennedy remained at this hour to most Americans, was destined to be not a movie idol but a television star, and television is a greater mystery than the movies. It is possible to speak of “the whole equation of pictures,” as Fitzgerald does in <em>The Last Tycoon</em>: there is no such calculation for television. But if television was a “cool” medium, per Marshall McLuhan, Jack Kennedy was “positively glacial” (Gore Vidal).</p>

<p>How vivaciously this then dawn-fresh, now lost time is captured in Geoffrey O’Brien’s <em>Dream Time: Chapters from the Sixties</em> (1988), and from the perspective of one of those uncanny children and knowing adolescents who people the other-directed fiction of the Postwar. After thirty years, <em>Dream Time</em> still reads convincingly as a mid- century <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> to some sort of enlightenment as it proceeds from “Once upon a time in the suburbs” to Mendocino, San Francisco, Berkeley, and an unnamed beach and mountain (Tamalpais?). Along the way, allegorical places, people and things: “The Paradise of Bourgeois Teenagers,” “Acid Revolution,” “The Myth of the Birth of the Hippie,” “Amerika, Amerika,” “The Great Fear,” and “Land’s End.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">In advance of the bubble domes on the moon, families could live in “glassy houses” on earth.

O’Brien:</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">Presiding over this shift in manners was the Janus-faced John F. Kennedy. While in one aspect of his being he was unleashing military ""advisers"" in Vietnam and the CIA at the Bay of Pigs, in another he was simultaneously exemplifying the newborn version of hedonism, consorting with movie actresses and playfully manipulating the erotic shadings of his own public image, as if to say, ""I am what you want to be."" ...

<p>The Postwar has been framed in terms of generations and media, the rise and fall of the New Deal order, the rise and fall of great powers, the American Century, the Jewish Century, the long 20th century and the short 20th century. In the U.S. the movement for Black civil rights, coinciding with decolonization abroad and Cold War tensions at home, demands to be seen in all of the long perspectives; and among the writers who were engaged in the movement, everybody knows James Baldwin’s name. Nobody broadcast on more frequencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Harold Norse’s <em>Memoirs of a Bastard Angel</em> (1989), we encounter Baldwin in Greenwich Village during the war, when his steadiest job was clearing tables at the Calypso café, and nobody knew his name. He despairs when his first novel is rejected. “Look at me! Just look! What do you see? I’m queer, ugly, and black! What future can I possibly have?” These despairs would be short-lived, however. In his second volume of essays, <em>Nobody Knows My Name</em> (1961)—coming on the eve of his celebrity (<em>Another Country</em> would be released the following year)—Baldwin writes,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">I had tried, in the States, to convey something of what it felt like to be a Negro and no one had been able to listen: they wanted their romance. And anyway, the really ghastly thing about trying to convey to a white man the reality of the Negro experience has nothing whatever to do with the fact of color, but has to do with this man’s relationship to his own life.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Later, in the years of Baldwin’s great fame, an envious friend tells him, “‘You’ve got it made.’ Jimmy reaction’s was one of horror. ‘What do you mean I’ve got it made?’ he exploded angrily. ‘I’m still <em>black</em>!’ He might have added, for it was equally true, ‘I’m still <em>gay</em>.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During his visit to the Bay Area in spring 1963, Baldwin, on a haunting drive around the cool gray city—recorded in the documentary <em><a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wnet/exploring-hate/2022/04/18/full-film-more-take-this-hammer-1964/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Take This Hammer</a></em> by the poet, filmmaker, public radio and television pioneer Richard O. Moore—declares there is “no moral distance” between Birmingham, Alabama, where Martin Luther King, Jr., and the SCLC cadres are at this moment confronting Bull Connor, and San Francisco, where “urban renewal” was desolating the Fillmore District. By then, Baldwin’s essays were appearing in the <em>New Yorker</em>, his novels and collected essays were published in hardcover by prestigious Knopf and in ubiquitous paperbacks by Dell, and television producers were discovering how entrancing his hooded eyes and eloquent gestures were to the camera. The mass market in print and the mass audience in television galvanize the civil rights movement, actually enable it.</p>

<p class=""indented"">The 1965 Oxford Union debate between Baldwin and William F. Buckley, Jr., was one of the legendary rhetorical confrontations of the Postwar, and one which the Oxford Union and posterity has declared Baldwin the winner. Back in Berkeley, in 1963, Richard Moore, who introduced the debate on “educational” television, calms Baldwin down for a radio interview in his house on Oregon Street by drawing him a bath and opening a bottle of Johnny Walker Black.</p>

<p>By 1965 the Postwar was happening in California, most tumultuously at the University of California, Berkeley, where the administration was still registering the shock of the Free Speech Movement. In Thomas Pynchon’s<em> The Crying of Lot 49</em>, Oedipa Maas is coming</p>

<p>A moment comes, O’Brien testifies, when sheer eventfulness and drug-related epiphanies open a transit into eternity. “It is still early 1967. In fact, it’s beginning to seem as if it will always be early 1967, as if such things were now really ready to melt into the new timelessness.” Meanwhile, the biggest event on Earth was the top-down “cultural revolution” in China.</p>

<p>Sober historians deplore the journalistic superstition that history occurs in decades—which, however, history in the 20th century tends to encourage: 1918-1919, end of World War I; 1929, the Wall Street Crash preluding the Great Depression; 1939, World War II (1941, Pearl Harbor). In 1950 the Cold War turned hot in Korea, seeming to confirm the pattern that continued in the “<em>tranquillized</em> Fifties” (Lowell), followed by the riotous ‘60s; and “we did have a sort of consciousness of living in the ‘Sixties’ while they were still going on,” Christopher Hitchens concedes in <em>Hitch-22</em>. “But the Seventies were only the Seventies because they had to have a name. Nullity and anticlimax appeared to close in on all sides.” It took a few years for the walls of the city to stop shaking.</p>

<p>Nicholas von Hoffman wrote of January 20, 1969, that if Nixon had ridden to his inauguration on a horse-drawn gilded carriage the sense of restoration couldn’t have been stronger. But the antiwar movement actually crested during the invasion of Cambodia in spring 1970, and Nixon’s presidency was consumed by Watergate, whose congressional investigation entailed many alarming revelations about the earlier Postwar.</p>

<p>“Is there something our rulers know that we don’t?” Gore Vidal asked in the pages of the <em>New York Review of Books</em> in 1976. “Is it possible that during the dark night of our empire’s defeat in Cuba and Asia the American story shifted from cheerful familiar farce to Jacobean tragedy—to murder, chaos?”</p>

<p>The voters had by then replaced the unelected Gerald Ford with decent Jimmy Carter, whose modest portion of charisma would be unequal to his misfortunes. Reagan’s two terms (“It’s Morning Again in America!”) <em>did</em> constitute a restoration of sorts but more Louis XVIII than Charles II or Napoleon III; now there was a nullity at the center. Channeling T.S. Eliot, Joan Didion would title her account of the Reagan White House “In the Realm of the Fisher King.” Mikhail Gorbachev inadvertently presided over the liquidation of the Russian empire in what Americans called Eastern Europe. The Cold War ended punctually in 1989-91, with the breakup of the Soviet Union. The events inspired Francis Fukayama’s famous essay on “The End of History,” a subtler thesis than is usually conceded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Malcolm Cowley, who lived throughout this entire span, and might even have heard of the rumor of history’s end before he died, didn’t in the end venture anything as provocative about the future of American or world literature as George Steiner in his essays “A Pythagorean Genre” and “In a Post-Culture,” or Lionel Trilling writing on adversary culture. Rather by the bye, he conceded that printed literature might come to be written and read only by scholars, and the public might read “picture books,” and consume tape-recorded stories, or dramas and serials for television, “or the new medium that will come after it,” all of which were common expectations at the time, and have been, usually in disappointing ways, perfectly fulfilled, according to McLuhan’s perception that the “content” of any medium is another medium. We have enjoyed since the Postwar a second “golden age of television,” which consisted of episodic dramas recapitulating night-time soap operas, and are now supposed to be enthralled by cinematic “universes” based on comic books from the 1930s and ‘40s. As an old-fashioned person of letters, Cowley hoped in his heart that the future of American literature would belong to another great innovator like Hemingway or Faulkner: “the lesser but talented men and women surrounding him will arrange themselves into a new configuration, like iron filings around a magnet.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>California fulfilled Cowley’s expectations of playing a larger role in literature, in part because of his own efforts, most famously shepherding Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> into print. The Beat movement’s <em>anni mirabili</em> were 1955-57 in San Francisco and Berkeley, and the Beats remain the only literary movement in America that readers take any sustained interest in except the Lost Generation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But back to the mid-century. In the teeming pages of Gunther’s <em>Inside U.S.A.</em>, there is no more poignant statistic than the fact that after the war “a recent Gallup poll showed that more Americans would prefer to live in Kentucky than anywhere else in the union.” Kentucky! the author wondered, Kentucky, which notwithstanding the legend of Daniel Boone and the gold in Fort Knox, was the 47th state in literacy (only Mississippi was more illiterate). Kentucky, where 97% of farms had no indoor toilets, and population had actually decreased during the war. Why, then, were people going to California when they really wanted to live in Kentucky? It’s a mystery, like so much of what happened in the Postwar; something had gone wrong in the dark fields of the republic. “Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny new car?” Ginsberg asked. Not Kentucky.</p>

<p class=""footnote"">Sources and further reading: Louis Menand’s <em>The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War </em>(New York, 2021) is a monumental intellectual history of America from the war to c.1965. In his notes Menand acknowledges, among other contemporary writers on the period, W. T. Lhamon, Thomas Crow, David Belgrad, Morris Dickstein, Mark Greif, and George Corkin; interestingly he fails to mention early surveyors, once of considerable fame, such as Harold Laski (<em>The American Democracy</em>, 1948) and Max Lerner (<em>America as a Civilization</em>, 1957). Arthur Marwick’s <em>The Sixties: Cultural Revolution in Britain, France, Italy, and the United States</em>, <em>c. 1968-c. 1974</em>) (Oxford and New York, 1998), has a span and a scope comparable to Menand’s. Eric F. Goldman’s <em>The Crucial Decade: America, 1945-1955 </em>was re-issued in an expanded version as <em>The Crucial Decade—and After, 1945-1960 </em>(New York, 1960). Other period histories are John Patrick Diggins, <em>The Proud Decades: America in War and Peace, 1941-1960 </em>and Marty Jezer, <em>The Dark Ages: Life in the United States, 1945-1960 </em>(Boston, 1982). Of the books published in the midst of things, or soon thereafter, Godfrey Hodgson’s <em>America in Our Time: From World War II to Nixon </em>(New York, 1976), still seems to me the most vivid.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">When I spoke to Sarah Schulman last December, an ice storm had turned Seattle into an urban rink and cars were hydroplaning down the hills in slow motion. Of course, neither of us had to go anywhere to connect. Sarah joined me via Zoom from her apartment in Manhattan’s East Village where she was preparing for a reading of her new play, <em>Free Ali! Free Bob!</em><br>
<br>
“It’s an update of a Chekhov play,” she said. “This idea of the provincial bourgeoisie who are very comfortable on top of their tiny world and dream of going to Moscow, but they never go.” The play probes the “gay art clique phenomena.” “I travel a lot,” she said, “and every town has a gay art clique and they rule with an iron glove.” She was also gearing up for a workshop of her play <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and a musical adaptation of her novel <em>Shimmer</em>. And it was in the land of the novel—Schulman is, first and foremost, a novelist—that our conversation began. From there we covered lesbian publishing, the professionalization of the artist, and other markers of the postwar milieu. This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sarah Schulman is the author of more than twenty works of fiction (including <em>The Cosmopolitans, Rat Bohemia</em>, and <em>Maggie Terry</em>), nonfiction (including <em>Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP: New York 1987-1993</em>, <em>Conflict is Not Abuse</em>, and <em>The Gentrification of the Mind</em>), and theater (<em>Carson McCullers, Manic Flight Reaction, </em>and more), and the producer and screenwriter of several feature films (<em>The Owls, Mommy Is Coming</em>, and <em>United in Anger</em>, among others). Her writing has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The New York Times, Artforum, </em>and many other outlets. She is the Ralla Klepak Professor of English at Northwestern University, a Fellow at the New York Institute of Humanities, the recipient of multiple fellowships from the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, and the New York Foundation for the Arts, and was presented in 2018 with Publishing Triangle’s Bill Whitehead Award. She is also the cofounder of the MIX New York LGBT Experimental Film and Video Festival, and the co- director of the groundbreaking ACT UP Oral History Project. A lifelong New Yorker, she is a longtime activist for queer rights and female empowerment, and serves on the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM:</strong> You published your first novel, <em>The Sophie Horowitz Story</em>, in 1984. It’s a detective novel. But I’m wondering if it’s a parody of a detective novel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SS:</strong> At that time there were very few queer detectives because it was a popular cultural genre, and most lesbian fiction was pulp or underground or coded. So the idea of taking a popular cultural form and inserting a lesbian character was a brand new idea and sort of arrogant. It was like saying, “Oh, we don’t just have to be in these marginal forms. We can also be in popular cultural forms.” I think that was about the third lesbian detective novel. The two previous ones were <em>Angel Dance</em> by M. F. Beal, which is obviously a pseudonym, and <em>Murder in the Collective</em> by Barbara Wilson. So it started out as a radical impulse and got co-opted very quickly because the industry was more willing to accept genre fiction with lesbian protagonists than mid list or literary fiction. And that is still true today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer""><em>The Sophie Horowitz Story</em> was published by Naiad Press.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naiad was started by Barbara Grier, who was the book critic for <em>The Ladder</em>, the magazine of the Daughters of Bilitis. It published pulp—romances and things like that—and serious books, like Patricia Highsmith’s <em>The Price of Salt</em>, which had been published under a pseudonym. It was based in Tallahassee, Florida, and really the only option for me. That first book had about 60 rejections and most of them were because of the lesbian content. I had letters saying, “Can’t you change the sexuality of the protagonist?” One guy wrote me and said, “This book would offend librarians,” which is funny because the Gay Librarians Association was the very first gay professional organization. So this guy was out of touch with librarians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within five or ten years there were hundreds of gay and lesbian detective novels and very few gay and lesbian literary novels. And this has been true all along. All of the forms that I work in don’t allow the content. You can have performance art with a lesbian protagonist, but getting productions for full character plays, the “blue ribbon” format, with lesbian adults is almost impossible. In books and film and on stage, the genre is the place where people are allowed to live. But in 1982 when the book was written—it was published in ‘84—that was unknown.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How would you describe the American publishing scene for women and lesbian writers in the 1980s?</p>

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">That surprises me. What do you mean by that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was dynamic. There was a rich and complex small press world of feminist and gay and lesbian presses that were selling quite well and had an impact on the culture. Their books were very widely read and created an “alternative” literary world. And there were a couple of openly lesbian editors in commercial and mainstream presses who were committed to publishing sophisticated, formally inventive lesbian literature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither of those things exist now. The lesbian literature published today by corporate presses is usually a variation of a well-tread, well- worn format that preexists. But there’s very little development of the literature itself. And, of course, the “alternative” sphere doesn’t exist at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>That gap is the thing. It’s true for plays, for movies, for television, for all kinds of art—except poetry.

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Would you say that the fiction being written today from a lesbian perspective or with lesbian characters is stagnant, or not inventive?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have no idea what’s being written. All we know is what’s being published. And what’s being published is, for any marginalized group, never representative of what’s being written. Even me. I’m like this bourgeois white woman in my sixties now—I have a professorship and all that stuff—and there’s no one like me in American publishing who is acquiring, even now. That gap is the thing. It’s true for plays, for movies, for television, for all kinds of art—except poetry. That gap is where the literature lives between what the people are creating and what the system is allowing the public to have.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You were born in New York City in the postwar boom fifties and you grew up in the sixties and seventies. Was the “alternative” gap bigger during that period of time?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The film critic Vito Russo talked about how even negative depictions of queer people gave the gay audience the knowledge that there were others, that they were not alone, even if the representations were distorted. I would say the books that I got some kind of lesbian subtext from were not intended for that purpose. I was born in 1958, which is 13 years after the end of the Holocaust, and every girl, every Jewish girl of my generation was given the <em>Diary of Anne Frank</em>. Everybody. They gave it to us with an intention. But I think that the actual consequence was that we got the message that girls could be writers. My whole generation wrote diaries. Of course, later I found out that there was lesbian content in her book that had been censored out. Maybe that was sensed somehow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other book was <em>Harriet The Spy</em> by Louise Fitzhugh, which is still in print. It’s for girls, but it’s about a tomboyish girl who is a writer. Fitzhugh was gay, and she told the truth about the people around her and they punished her for it. This was a very popular book. Those would be the beginning of my exposure to lesbian literature. But the first real lesbian book I ever read was <em>Rubyfruit Jungle</em> by Rita Mae Brown. It was published by a women’s press in California called Daughters Incorporated. It was part of that sort of underground alternative culture. Later it was bought by Bantam. There was a commercial paperback edition.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">I’d like to get a sense of what’s disappeared, of what you have written about as having disappeared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing is the economy has changed. The city is too expensive and that’s why there are so many homeless people here. There are a lot of empty storefronts and empty hotel rooms and empty offices and thousands and thousands and thousands of homeless people with nowhere to go. The seizing of the city by real estate is really the difference. Anything else is a consequence of that.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>When you have a gentrified city, the kinds of people who can live there tend to be from wealthier backgrounds. They have a more intact relationship to capital. There’s space, but the people who are using it may not represent difference. They may already be mass produced in their thinking.... Now there’s a selection process where people get professionalized and “branding” dominates everything. It’s detrimental. It homogenizes form. It homogenizes influences.</p></blockquote></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">In your book <em>The Gentrification of the Mind: Witness to a Lost Imagination</em>, you argue that this was a direct consequence of AIDS, that all of these vibrant, queer countercultures and spaces disappeared when people died of AIDS.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a tiny argument inside this book. I’m just trying to explain that what makes cities great is urbanity, and urbanity means difference. People who live there are aware that they are different. They see that other people are different. And this is why cities produce political movements and art ideas for the world. All the great political movements of women’s liberation, Black power, gay liberation do not come from the suburbs. These movements come from cities and, when you homogenize the city, that can get lost. Cities stop being places that produce new ideas for the world because the very nature of difference—difference in relationship to each other—is removed. You have a gentrified dominant culture that codes itself as progressive or hip or whatever. But actually it’s quite boring because it’s very mass produced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">In the book you argue that with the disappearance of art spaces where people could hang out and make things, the art and culture became commercial and less challenging. Is that right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not really. Let me say it a little differently. There are two elements that you’re bringing up: the space and the people. When real estate gets seized and artists or immigrants or people with new ideas who are not wealthy cannot live or work, then they can’t be there or they can’t be themselves. But when there is space available, who can access it? When you have a gentrified city, the kinds of people who can live there tend to be from wealthier backgrounds. They have a more intact relationship to capital. There’s space, but the people who are using it may not represent difference. They may already be mass produced in their thinking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of it is professionalization. When you have an artist—what is an artist? Let’s start with that. I would say my definition is a person who makes art, who thinks about art, who looks at art, who talks about art. That’s an artist. You’re involved in some kind of discourse with other people and with yourself. But now there’s a selection process where people get professionalized and “branding” dominates everything. It’s detrimental. It homogenizes form. It homogenizes influences. It creates networks of power that give people access because they’ve been branded in a certain way. Artists are about individual voice, so it’s counter-indicated to actual art-making to have everything be mass produced and highly selected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">So then what is interesting is what happens underneath the professionalization: the inventiveness, the reinventing of language that the artist is responsible for in alternative spaces. Only there are fewer alternative spaces now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>I’m going to have an interesting experience right now. I taught at the City University of New York for 23 years and now I’ve gone to Northwestern in Chicago, which is a private university. I’m having this shift from open admissions, where anybody with a GED, anybody with a high school diploma could be in my class, to a highly elite, highly selected student group where we take four out of 300 people. I’m experiencing this as evidence that open admissions is better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, sometimes things that are rewarded are actually good. But usually something is rewarded because it fits the needs of the apparatus that controls the reward system. They’re marketing themselves with who they reward or what they reward. But just walking into a room where everyone in your writing class is there because they have a high school diploma, I think it’s better for the culture. That’s the problem with this reduction process. It makes being heard almost impossible. Now, you started by talking about the alternative publishing of the seventies and eighties. That was a subculture. But subculture is hard to build in a reward economy. Now most marginalized people learn about themselves from corporate media. It’s complicated. It’s less visceral.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You published your second novel, <em>Girls, Visions and Everything</em>, in 1986. It has a great first line: “Lila Futuransky always knew she was an outlaw, but she could never figure out which one.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The title comes from a Jack Kerouac novel. I was born on 10th Street and I live on 9th Street. Our local bookstore was 8th Street Bookshop. It had all the Beats. When I was very young, I heard Herbert Huncke give a reading at St. Mark’s Poetry Project. I was always thinking about the Beats. They were so male, right? So I guess the idea of <em>Girls, Visions and Everything </em>was, What if you’re a gay girl and you’re going on the same adventure? Well, it’s totally different because just going outside is so much more dangerous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">The protagonist, Lila Futuransky, carries a copy of <em>On the Road</em> in her back pocket. Did the Beats influence your own writing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think so. The whole book is a reaction to reading their books. But it’s so long ago. The weird thing is I’ve published 20 books and written more than that, and I don’t re-read them unless they’re reissued. Right now <em>Shimmer</em> is being reissued. So I have to re-read it to write an introduction. <em>Girls, Visions and Everything</em> has never been out of print. I’ve never reread it. It’s hard to remember what I was thinking at the time.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What about this idea of bohemia? Henri Murger wrote, in the introduction to <em>Scènes de la vie de bohème</em> (Scenes of Bohemian Life), that “Bohemia only exists and is only possible in Paris.” He was wrong, surely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was very exposed to that as a kid. My father’s best friend wore a beret and he was the fifties beatnik guy who played chess and taught me how to play chess and how to play the recorder. I remember being a kid with my grandmother and seeing hippie runaways in the Village, dressed in black velvet clothes and barefoot with their faces painted. The hotel across the street from our apartment was called the Albert Hotel, and it had a lot of trans. Bohemia is something I was always aware of.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In those days, as a young person in New York, you could run around wherever you wanted. There were no helicopter parents. We got train passes when we were in first grade, so we could go anywhere, and we did. I could discover whatever I wanted, and bohemia has been there since I was born. It’s always been part of my landscape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, Vivian Gornick, who’s someone I respect enormously, wrote a bad review of <em>Rat Bohemia</em> in the <em>Women’s Review of Books</em>. And she made a very important point. She said, These people are not bohemians because they were thrown out. Bohemians are people who choose to leave the bourgeois class. And she’s absolutely right. It took me until then to actually make that differentiation in my mind.</p>

<p>Well, it’s interesting in terms of the East Village. The prices for living in the East Village are ridiculous. I mean, nobody that I would want to have living in this city can afford to live here. However, people who feel like they’re outsiders come and walk around here. I see the goth kids and the trans kids and the crusties, and they’re just walking around, hanging out, even though there’s really nothing happening. But <em>they’re</em> happening with each other, so it still has this weird meaning to people, even though they could never afford to live here and probably couldn’t afford to eat here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My friend, Kathy Danger, just called me this morning. We call it the “Colonial Williamsburg Effect.” It’s like the Museum of the Seventies that still coexists with East Village. Kathy’s downstairs neighbors were just raided for drugs, for selling magic mushrooms, and we’re like, “Oh, that’s so seventies! That’s still going on!” You can’t kill it. You can try, but it still has that meaning of belonging for people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Retrospectively, I’ve realized that the job of a novelist is to show how people understand their own lives. Not how we wish people would understand their lives, not how we think they should understand their lives, but how they actually do. And when people are in the middle of a cataclysm, but a collective cataclysm, there’s a practical side, there’s a crazy side, there are jokes. That’s how people deal with their own experiences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">I remember when Rita describes a male character in a casket who has just died of AIDS. You write, “There was this wafting of embalming fluid, and it was horrible. It didn’t smell like dead animals. It smelled like chemistry or the inside of a xerox store.” Which leads me to your most recent nonfiction book, <em>Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP New York, 1987- 1993</em>. It’s like a distillation of things that you saw while you were involved in ACT UP at that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a book that I had to write. I really didn’t want to, but I had to because the whole period was being misrepresented. My novels from the AIDS period already existed, but this book was not just about me. I wanted people who were being written out of history to be heard. Jim Hubbard and I had spent 18 years interviewing 188 people. We had created all this data. And despite all this evidence, these false histories were being produced and praised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What kind of false histories are you talking about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I talk about it in the introduction, and I don’t want to say names of other people’s work here. It’s like when the gay character is all alone and is dependent on the straight person to rescue them, which is a trope in some of our most rewarded works. This is false because gay people helped each other. Fake stories of people abandoning each other, which is really not what occurred. Stories of a handful of white individuals who single-handedly changed the world, which is impossible. It’s not just inaccurate, but impossible. It was making me crazy. And we had hoped that by creating the data, other people would rise to the occasion. But it’s very, very hard to go against iconic works that are false, that are embedded in the reward system because you’re considered a terrible person if you even question these things. They’re so over-praised. And so used to not being analyzed that simply asking, What is this work actually saying? and, What values is it actually representing? is considered a terrible assault. But actually it’s what should be happening from the beginning, because people should make whatever they want to make, but works are received in certain ways. And this gets back to the question about the difference between what’s being written and what’s being published. Things are received because they make the apparatus comfortable. I’m never questioning the artist making what they want to make, but we have to look at why certain things are elevated and other things are repressed. Unfortunately, once you do that, then the apparatus gets mad at you and then they try to punish you. It’s a vicious cycle. But that’s the reality.</p>

<p>Nobody would publish that book. I mean, nobody. I went high and I went low. I tried every element of American publishing that I had ever had a relationship with—corporate publishers, left wing publishers, university presses, feminist presses. I mean, everybody. The only place that would publish it was a small publisher in Vancouver, Canada. Now, you’re in Seattle, but in New York, people don’t even know where Vancouver is. I thought, “This book is gonna go down the rabbit hole and no one’s ever going to see it.” But I had no choice because nobody else would publish it. So Brian Lam at Arsenal Pulp published it, and today he has sold 45,000 copies. It’s been translated into French, Italian, and Spanish. It showed that even today you can beat the machine. The problem was that it was too far ahead. This is always the problem. You have something that’s too far ahead and gatekeepers are limited personalities. If they were imaginative, future-seeking people, they wouldn’t be doing what they’re doing now.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And you’re talking about the way the oppressed becomes the oppressor. Is that right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean, there are a lot of ideas in there. Which is why at the beginning of the book I say this is not a book to be agreed with. I think the idea that you’re going towards is that people who are endangered—Black people killed by the police, people with AIDS in Canada subjected to HIV criminalization, Palestinians—are misrepresented as dangerous when they are actually endangered. In this way, the actual perpetrator presents themselves as though they are the victim. It’s a false positioning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost all of my books have been reviewed by <em>Publishers Weekly</em>, but they didn’t review <em>Conflict Is Not Abuse</em>. That’s how on the margins Arsenal Pulp was. But because it was published in Canada, Arsenal had money from Canada Council. In the United States, there are no federal funds for the arts, really. There’s a very tiny map and most people don’t have any government money to help create<br>new ideas. But in Canada they do because it’s a country with a lot of oil and very few people. And if they didn’t fund Canadian culture, there wouldn’t be any, because it would be steamrolled by Hollywood and America. So, because it was a Canadian press, they had money from Canada Council to send me on a book tour. If it had been published in America, that never would’ve happened. So they sent me on a Canadian book tour.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started in Montreal and I moved west and I had quite large audiences from the beginning. Very quickly I noticed that the audiences were very young. People in their twenties who were concerned about what’s now called “cancel culture.” But I didn’t really know about it. I wasn’t thinking about that. I wasn’t writing about that. But they were experiencing this kind of shunning and incredibly inflated, escalated attacks about nothing at an intense emergency level. And that was why they were coming. So this whole dialogic conversation was something that could only happen in person. And by the time I got to the West Coast, I had 400 people. This was all internet. I know a little internet, but a lot of it is beyond me. You know, I’m old. So a lot of this was going on in spheres that I don’t even know how to access.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, there was so much buzz or whatever about these ideas that <em>Publishers Weekly</em> ended up having to review it five months after publication, which never happens. It’s supposed to be three months before the book is published. But it became a phenomenon. The machine got beat, but nobody tried to beat it. It just happened because it was on the nose. And with <em>Gentrification of the Mind</em>, it’s hard to understand why it’s so popular now. I mean, I couldn’t get it published for 10 years. I finally got it published. And it’s cited all the time. I don’t know why now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have this other book called <em>Ties That Bind</em>, which is about homophobia in the family. That’s another book I couldn’t publish for 10 years. I wrote four books during those 10 years. And then they all got published at once. I mean, the New Press kind of printed it. There were no readings. It just existed. Now people are quoting it, now people are reading it. People who, I don’t know why—I don’t know what’s happening in people’s families. I guess that young people have expectations that are beyond the behavior of their families, even though it’s all on a very different scale than what I was talking about. But they’re relating to it. Sometimes these things happen and I don’t totally understand why.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">I wanted to ask you about one of your plays. You wrote about Carson McCullers (Lula Carson Smith), who had her major moment during publishing’s postwar boom, and who seems wildly bohemian. It’s called <em>Carson McCullers (Historically Inaccurate)</em>, and I’m curious why you have “Historically Inaccurate” in parentheses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that time, most of the theaters in New York City had all male, all white seasons. It was very hard for any woman playwright to get her play produced. I was afraid that they were going to find a way to take it down because all the critics were men. And in fact, they did take it down. But I was trying to protect myself. I thought that they would complain that it wasn’t historically accurate. I put “Historically Inaccurate” so that they couldn’t say it was not historically accurate. Actually, it was so hyper accurate and so ahead of how people understood Carson McCullers. At the time—I wrote it in 2000—I perceived that she was what we now call trans, but that she didn’t have language for it. And I wrote the play saying that, and this was an unacceptable idea. This is before the trans revolution, before <em>Transparent</em> and before popular cultural trans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the time, her estate was controlled by the same people who had been her agents when she was alive. They were people in their eighties. They were so angry that I was making this claim that they actually didn’t show up on opening night. And there was a row of empty seats in the middle of the theater. Then their machine, their apparatus, started writing things about how stupid and terrible the play was. But years later, because of <em>Transparent</em>—and whatever people think of <em>Transparent</em>, it did change the world—I was able to write an article in the <em>New Yorker</em> explaining, and this is like 15 years after the play was trashed, that Carson McCullers was trans, and that legitimized the idea. And then the estate, which was now run by new people because the old people had died, invited me to give the keynote at her centenary. I went and I said she was trans. Her psychiatrist had just died at 103, but her surviving partner was there, and I asked her, Do you think I’m on the right track? And she said, Keep going.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Is Carson McCullers someone that influenced you as a person or writer in some way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, as a person, she was a mess. She died of alcoholism at age 50. I met a lot of people who knew her. I met Tobias Schneebaum, the writer who knew her. And Anne Truitt, the sculptor who knew her, and every story that anyone had about her was crazy. You know, she showed up with four drunken sailors. She sat in the corner in her kimono and wouldn’t talk to you. It was like no one had a story about her being nice or helping somebody. So she had all kinds of conflicts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think her writing is incredible, absolutely incredible. And it’s too good to influence me. The only writer I’ve ever read who can do what she can do is Caryl Phillips. He’s a writer from St. Kitts and he’s also able to inhabit any kind of person from any perspective. It’s phenomenal. But, you know, that’s the gold standard.</p>

2533,"In Conversation: Susan Chen","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">Susan Chen (b. 1992, Hong Kong SAR, China) is a New York-based artist who has used oil paint and other materials to reimagine the representation of communities from the Asian diaspora in thickly painted and boldly colored figurative portraits. Her current exhibition ""Purell Night &amp; Day,"" which runs until August 18, 2023 at Rachel Uffner Gallery in New York, takes the concept of purification in a time of tragedy, as symbolized by the Purell bottle, to its limit. We spoke in July and our conversation was condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>SKY O'BRIEN:</strong> How did you come up with the idea to paint bottles of Purell hand sanitizer?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>SUSAN CHEN:</strong> I don't know about you, but I see Purell everywhere—in restaurants, schools, and shops. It's this little figure, a bit ghostlike, that's just lurking around in the background now. I thought about how this “99.99%” stuff is supposed to mass disinfect humanity and the entire world. I remember getting on a plane and they were dishing out Purell wipes to everyone. It was a 300-person-full flight, and I thought there was something peculiar about it. Like, Oh, you’re all going to squish in this small condensed space for 4 hours and these wipes are going to stop you from getting a disease from the person next door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I picked Purell because it seemed like the most popular brand of hand sanitizer—Purell and hand sanitizer are kind of interchangeable. When I started doing the pastels, I was actually nervous—if I didn't put in the Purell words, would people read them as Purell? I realized that they could be read as soap bottles or something else.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The last global pandemic happened 100 years ago, but I've personally lived through SARS in 2005 and Swine in 2009. The coronavirus felt like a third version to me, on a grander scale. SARS and Swine killed a lot of people, but in the aftermath I witnessed how everyone seemed to forget the period. For example, there were no policy changes in the controlling of wet markets. Society moved on quickly. Covid is obviously on a grander scale, and I wonder if we will similarly forget it in a few years time. But for now, this hand sanitizer is like a ghost lurking in the background.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Did these feelings shape your color choices and composition? Your Purells are not representational.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's more of an artist’s challenge. It's easy to paint something realistic, the challenge is always, how do you paint something abstract or different? And how do you paint the same thing in a hundred different ways? I did a version of the clock where each hour was a different color and it just didn't look right. Something I learned from the show is how to limit my color palette. Less is more—and maybe writers have this too, as a challenge of growth. As a painter, I’m always trying to ask, How can I say the most with the least amount? Sometimes I think of Matisse's cutouts at the end of his life—you know, they're very simple, but they get to the point. For a painter to grow in the long run, I wonder, how do you edit things out?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">There's one piece in the show, <em>Purell Tower, 2023</em>, that’s more figurative and almost surreal, where hordes of sanitizer bottles make up a person’s body. You’ve made a few self portraits in your career and I was wondering if this is another self portrait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could definitely be a self portrait, but I purposefully shaped the canvas into the size of a full length mirror. So there’s an element of reflection. And I wanted it to be a tower. At first, I wanted to make a really, really big painting, but I only had two months to put the show together—you know, when the gallery shows up in March, and it’s like, could you take this slot in June. So I asked myself, What can I do in two months? It was good because it put me under pressure. I thought, this is a summer show, and summer's about experimenting. This is a good time to try a bunch of different things and if it fails, it's summer, no one will really see it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented""><em>Purell Tower </em>is related to Covid, but also metaphorically it could represent any woman. Sometimes society puts greater pressure on women to seek perfection or a higher standard of cleanliness. Even just hours spent on domestic cleaning. I think Bill and Melinda Gates did a study and found that on average women do seven extra years of domestic work than men—in that time, you could get a PhD! Looking back at previous paintings, this theme seems to pop up here and there. I'm always fascinated by cleaning products and how they're related to being a woman. Like why are the two inextricably tied to one another? We're lucky we live in a more progressive country, but in other parts of the world, the two are very much intertwined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Did the way you look at Purell change over the course of those two months?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the beginning, I was amazed that this tiny bottle could hold an entire world's sense of disaster and paranoia and grief—and it all fits in the size of your hand. This thing carries a lot of weight for its size. I painted three Purells every day for two months. I did feel like I was going a little crazy by the end. But did I see a change? I’m not sure. I was curious to discover that Purell is a third generation and now female-owned brand. This idea of branding capitalism and the question of who wins during a war was something that crossed my mind. During Hurricane Sandy, all these roof shingle companies were like, Oh, it would be great to have more storms so that we can sell more roof shingles. During a pandemic, so many people are losers, but who are the possible winners?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Painting these things every day, there was also an element of hoarding that is very reflective of what was happening during Covid. I also did clocks because I wanted to cast a time marker, whether it's the time marker of the end of a journey or just a time marker of an element of stillness that was in everyone's lives for a period. There was also this idea of night and day. I didn't realize that “night and day” was an English idiom that meant things were getting better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Will you talk about the arrangement of <em>Purell Clock: Day</em> and <em>Purell Clock: Night</em>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Originally, I wanted to do a clock where I was reflecting the different hours of the day and capturing the time of day. However, I quickly realized this was very hard technically. Also, 1:00 PM and 1:00 AM are different. So I turned it into a night and day clock. The clock is a symbol of something ongoing, you know, like 24 hours of disinfecting that's happening around the world. I don't know, there's something uncanny about the mass disinfecting of society. The idea that this is going to fix all of us, like a universal savior. There’s some dark humor there.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">When I look at these paintings, I'm reminded of Andy Warhol's soup cans and Wayne Thiebaud’s cakes. Did Pop Art shape how you painted and drew this series?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, absolutely. Warhol's soup cans were very much about American consumerism, commercialism, branding, and entering into the age of advertising, like in <em>Mad Men</em>. And Wayne Thiebaud is very much about looking—just <em>looking</em> at things—and capturing color at different hours of the day under California light. I haven't seen his pastels in real life, but I know he's made them, and I know he's had pastel shows in the past. Of course, we always think about Morandi when we think of still life. It's funny because Morandi was painting these vases and bottles back then, but in contemporary art today, it's like the Purell bottle is a replacement for these simple ceramic structures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got into pastels because I saw a Paula Rego retrospective for the first time last year. Her work blew my mind. I realized that the majority of her works are pastels mounted on aluminum panels. That’s how I got into soft pastel. But I didn't know I was allergic to them. I started using these soft pastels and I was like, Why do my lungs feel like they're on fire? I had to take an allergy test for something else that happened around the same time and turns out I'm really allergic to pastels. I had to wear a PPE bubble helmet the whole time I made those works. There’s some sort of irony that I was painting Purell bottles in PPE. But I guess it didn’t stop me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also thinking of Sam Messer’s series of typewriters that are really beautifully painted in oils. And Chris Ofili had this watercolor practice where every morning he'd spend 30 minutes drawing a little head on paper. I like the idea of joining a lineage of artists who were making work by looking at something really mundane and amplifying it. I don't know if anyone else has looked so closely at sanitizer.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Sanitizer is such a modern invention, and you're creating a new way of looking at it in the context of the pandemic. You also used foam as a material in this series, is that right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two or three paintings in the show with foam. In my studio I went down this rabbit hole of impasto painting and ways of building up surfaces and making paints thicker. I thought I would experiment by cutting out foam and preparing the surface with acrylic and oil ground and then painting on top of that. I thought this would allow me to make some interesting paintings on a larger scale. But cutting foam is pretty tedious. Either you have to cut it with a hot wire cutter—this is insulation foam used in homes—or you're using sculpting foam and that also creates a lot of toxic dust. It didn’t leave me as satisfied as I thought it would. It almost felt like a gimmick. Maybe I just didn't enjoy putting that surface together. Epoxy is hardcore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">So you wouldn't use it again?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Using foam for small paintings is doable. But for large paintings it would definitely take more than one person to try to build the surface, or just a long time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">You entered the art world at the start of the pandemic, and a lot of your work has responded to the way the pandemic has shaped culture in the United States. What’s next?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently moved into a commercial studio space that is not in a school setting or in a home garage or artist residency. I'm working on my next show due in March and it's mostly themed around women’s advocacy. It feels easy and there’s a kinship to working with women, especially during a time when abortion laws have changed. It’s been really reassuring to have different women come through the studio to share their personal stories, and that collectively we are creating an exhibition together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think I make work in response to real time: what's happening around me and what I see in the news. I don't think all artists work this way, that is, reacting so directly to the news, and sometimes there is a lag time between what I see happening in society and then getting it down on paper.&nbsp;I equate my job sometimes to feeling like a journalist. I’m often amazed by market-successful artists who can keep painting the same subject matter for 5-10 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming out of graduate school, I am adjusting to what it means to be an artist working in the market. I feel like I came into this sort of naively. It’s easier to make art when you don't have market pressure and can make whatever you want to make. Part of making these Purells again and again and again might be subconsciously related to being like, Oh my God, I actually have to pay studio rent. I have to be able to afford rent this month. And so my hours of being able to generate something completely new gets cut short.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is something I'm trying to get used to. Suddenly, I understand why someone <em>would</em> make the same work for 10 years. Sometimes you just have to pay for things, you know—like your life and kids and studio rent and stuff like that, your priorities also shift at different stages in your life. And sometimes collectors just want oil paintings (auction-friendly works), or collect “what you are known for,” and there can be little room for experimentation when you need to cover real life expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It really changes my idea of what it means to be a successful artist. I’m trying my best to keep making work with intention at the core of my studio practice, but I can see how this gets difficult, and you really have to protect it.</p>

<p><strong>EARLIER THIS SUMMER</strong>, Art Queen Gallery in Joshua Tree presented <em><a href=""https://spacecowboybooks.com/butterworth-exhibit-at-art-queen-gallery/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Circularisations</a></em>, a collection of thought-provoking works by Michael Butterworth originally published in the British New Wave SF magazine <em>New Worlds </em>in 1969. Curated by Space Cowboy Books, the show blended the elements of alternative art, poetry, science fiction, and New Wave music that have defined Butterworth’s five-decade output as a genre-bending artist and writer. Based for all of his career in his native Manchester, Butterworth is best known for his science fiction novels and experimental poetry, his role as co-publisher (with David Britton) of Savoy Books, and collaborations with bands like New Order and Hawkwind. Far from the UK in a high desert town, this latest presentation of Butterworth’s distinctive and sometimes daunting works has bolstered an already formidable underground reputation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exhibition offered viewers an unusual gallery experience, as the displayed artworks were in fact poems, adapted into diagram-like visuals. Alternating between black and white backgrounds, seemingly nonsensical lines of poetry were assembled in circular motions, set against the dizzying, reflective aluminum panels of the gallery walls. At first glance, the works might have seemed cryptic, but when examined long enough, their meanings became visible. Once adjusted to the unusual placement of the words, the viewer could then draw correlations between phrases in whichever order they chose. Ultimately, these were literary experiments which questioned how we might receive both visual and textual information at once: If words became images, might their symbology change?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">According to Butterworth’s artist statement, “Circularisation came about in part from an Aldous Huxley-inspired LSD experience during which the word ‘anarchy’ in a front-page newspaper headline about strikers in a car plant had the explosive effect of literally enveloping me in an explosion of images of chaos—far more than reading a newspaper normally would have done.” Butterworth was spurred to break down language from its usual frame of reference and challenge the linearity of the written word. His works in this series focus on anti-war sentiments, especially in response to the war in Vietnam. Poetic fragments such as “Atom war – A no-truce sequel” and “Remarque trench fire darkness” crossed with sensory-specific phrases like “Edged calm warmth” added for emotional effect, and perhaps even a bit of cognitive dissonance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s apparent that various influences and affinities also connect him to the Dadaists and other revolutionists of the word in the earlier 20th century. Butterworth originally intended for these stationary images to be moving graphics, in which the individual lines intersected and rotated in clocklike fashion, to vanish and then reappear at the start of each loop. Although this series only ended up in print, the exhibition honored his vision by featuring a visual and audio installation of an untitled piece where a conversation about Christmas love and trench warfare on screen was accompanied by the sound of crashing waves.</p>

Notably, the film touches on Butterworth’s co-ownership of the eponymous “House,” a bookstore apparently named after a horror novel by William Hope Hodgson and the affiliated Savoy Books, a publishing house, which, in the 1970s, published and sold works persecuted for obscenity. Titles such as Charles Platt’s <em>The Gas</em> and Samuel L. Delaney’s <em>The Tides of Lust </em>were among the “black-jacket” line of edgy erotica which quickly attracted the attention of local authorities.<strong> </strong>These iconoclastic publications led to skirmishes with British law that resulted in police raids and battles over censorship. Butterworth, who at one point was jailed for a month, remained unrelenting in his advocacy of freedom of expression in the arts, eventually founding <em>Corridor8</em>, a journal of contemporary arts and literature.</p>

<p class=""indented""><em>Circularisations</em> coincided with the release of Butterworth’s <em><a href=""https://bookshop.org/p/books/complete-poems-1965-2020-first-hardback-michael-butterworth/19442423?ean=9781732825772"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Complete Poems 1965-2020</a></em>, published by Space Cowboy Books. The collection offers a personal window into the artist’s polychromatic life, with topics ranging from outsider<strong> </strong>life in 1960s Manchester all the way to the tender reflections of a grandfather in the present day. There are also underlying apocalyptic and environmentalist themes meandering their way through many of its pages, solidifying Butterworth’s connection to a deep foreboding tradition in science fiction, extending from Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and Poe to Burroughs, again, and J. G. Ballard, who also published in <em>New Worlds</em>.</p>

<p>In the poem “These Strange Things Called Trees,” for instance, he warns of trees going extinct should we continue our destructive behavior towards the environment:</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">These strange things called trees<br>
Like missiles thudding<br>
Nose-down in the earth<br>
Stuck unwavering like brown knives,<br>
Or darts, their alveoli flights<br>
Sprayed like twisted limbs<br>
In intricate array.<br>
Inevitably, like the rest of Nature<br>
They will succumb<br>
To a grim determination.<br>
In their museums<br>
They will look even stranger.</p>

<p>Additional elements of the exhibit included photographs, magazine covers, and other memorabilia given proper museum-style treatment inside a shiny glass case.

2628,Lamentations,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>THIS</strong> <strong>YEAR, WE EXPERIENCED </strong>an unprecedented event at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, just days before Tisha B'Av. One of the most significant fast days of the Jewish calendar, Tisha B'Av—the ninth day of the month of Av—mourns the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem as well as a series of other tragedies that have befallen the People of Israel. It is the only twenty-five hour fast that’s observed according to rabbinical rather than biblical edict, and is generally considered the saddest day of the year, commemorating every major historical event that led to the oppression, dispersion, or mass annihilation of Jews.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Israel, Tisha B'Av usually happens around the time that the Knesset takes its summer recess. And, usually, the two events have little to do with each other. But this year the governing coalition—the most fundamentalist government Israel has ever seen—passed a bill that limited the Supreme Court’s ability to review governmental and ministerial decisions—a direct attack on the state’s fragile democratic fabric. Our society had been upended ever since the so-called judicial overhaul was unveiled in January, which many of us saw as an attempted legislative coup. By July, in the days leading up to the bill’s passing, the political situation in Israel had deteriorated to what many felt was its first existential crisis engendered by internal rather than external forces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did not grow up religiously observant. For me, Tisha B'Av had little significance until I moved to Jerusalem, when I began to learn about the deeper meaning the day has for Jews both in Israel and the Diaspora. The loss of the national home combined with the extreme hardships of millennia of exile made for an especially poignant day of reflection. It wasn’t just about losing an edifice. It was about being a people that was repeatedly wronged by greater powers—including those held by our leaders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tisha B'Av, we recall that the reason for the fall of the Second Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE, 517 years after the first, was not merely the attacks of foreign powers, but <em>Sinat Hinam,</em> or the baseless hatred among Jewish groups. Jews believe that we are collectively responsible for our own fall as a nation. And Tisha B'Av, as a day of mourning, theoretically represents a way of coming back together by repairing our broken relations. As long as we observe Tisha B'Av, we can possibly remind ourselves that our baseless hatreds have continuously weakened us as a people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Living in Jerusalem for fifteen years has changed my connection to Tisha B’Av. At first, I approached it more or less at face value: as the symbolic loss of our nation's sense of unity as well as the physical palace where we recognized divinity and its place in our spiritual lives. Later, the more I settled into the city, the stranger it felt to mourn something so present. So I began to focus on the Holocaust, which is an approach practiced by many. Slowly, as I used the evening hours to reflect on the mass annihilation of Europe's Jews, I cut my fast to midday, especially since fasting as a form of thanksgiving didn't seem right. I felt actually <em>grateful </em>to call Jerusalem my home. I was mourning a past that felt contrary to the reality before my eyes. I, for one, did not need a Temple to feel connected to the sense of divinity that draws so many people from so many religions to this place.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I have never personally identified with most government or security policies, and I have always been aware of how problematic Jewish sovereignty in the Holy Land could be. I'd always voted left and was repeatedly angered by facts on the ground. I also understood that the State of Israel was an existential reality for millions of Jews who, like myself, were born here. And many of us worked as a society toward increased justice and equality among our demographics, both through individual actions and through support for parties that backed liberal policies. As critically-minded individuals, these were the ways we contributed to an open society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister in 2009, I waited patiently—if frustratedly—for the next election, before being disappointed by his reelection in 2013. I waited again and, though encouraged when his government fell only two years later, was ever more embittered when he became Prime Minister in 2015. Then came a criminal indictment and five elections in less than three years, all through which Bibi—as he’s known to Israelis—strengthened every undemocratic element in the Knesset to keep himself in power. He had done something unimaginably destructive. He'd ruined the nation's appetite for democracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By finding all kinds of legal byways and workarounds to use the system against itself, he kept the political echelon under his control, refusing to step down despite being the main obstacle to democratic consensus in the country. He repeatedly sided with power over social concern, and like all leaders who emphasize personal gain over the collective good, incited a level of baseless hatred that has reached biblical proportions. This year, as the Knesset debated the bill that would endow the executive branch with near-unchecked power, and as tens of thousands of people formed a human chain from the Western Wall to the Knesset, the sense was that we were barreling, in the lead up to Tisha B’Av, toward a destruction unlike anything seen for generations—and one which we would have no one to blame but our own people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As this year’s Tisha B'Av approached, I thought about how I would frame my observance. But I also experienced an unusual sense of resentment, which led me to one facet of the historical story of the Second Temple's destruction that I hadn't singled out before: the anger that people must have felt at the nation’s leaders, whose baseless hatred drove them to so much destruction and loss. The idea that I was supposed to mourn the loss of something that had been destroyed by people who claimed to have my own good in mind—but who were actually causing irreparable harm to the society in which I lived—was driving me mad. Powerful people were dictating our lives and we were supposed to mourn the results of actions by people just like them?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I sat with this anger for a number of days. I knew that anger was only a small step away from hatred—that the governing coalition’s methods were succeeding in fanning the flames of destruction within myself—but I couldn't help it. It happened to be my wife's birthday, so I took her and our little girls to Bethlehem of the Galilee, a German Templer colony that was established in the early 20th century and that became a Nazi-pit in the early 1930s. The village was depopulated by the British during the outbreak of the Second World War and repopulated by Jews after the first Arab-Israeli War ended in 1948. It was in this surreal setting, at a food truck set up outside a Templer building that housed a local family, that I spoke to a woman who'd come from a nearby town to taste the homemade pastries.</p>

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>She seemed to be suggesting that by having to fight for something that feels so basic, we had somehow lost it already.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">As we sat at neighboring tables scattered between the food truck and the Templer house, I lamented the political crisis and suggested that these trucks, which had popped up across the country, functioned as liminal spaces where we could rest from the anger, hatred, and oppressiveness that had seeped into most of the private and public places where we spent our time. She agreed, noting they had become popular when the coronavirus pandemic created demand for outdoor spaces where people could gather. I thought her association likened our national crisis to the outbreak of a deadly disease, contributing to a sense that no place was ultimately safe. She strengthened this impression by adding that, even in her own home, she and her husband were on opposite sides of the issue. “We try not to bring arguments home,” she said, “but it's hard.” Then, sighing, she added, ""What I mostly see around me is that people are very sad.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She seemed to be suggesting that by having to fight for something that feels so basic, we had somehow lost it already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked at a young couple ordering coffee from the truck and I understood something I had not grasped earlier: that Tisha B'Av was not just about loss, it was about the pain of injustice—the tragedy that accompanies a destruction so great it's beyond blame. When Jews lost Jerusalem, they experienced the loss of a place that had itself been founded by millennia of injustice and violence—the way of humanity. Jerusalem had always been a city ruled by power, whether by the Israelis, the Jordanians, the British, the Ottomans, the Crusaders, the Mamluks, the Byzantines, the Romans, the Hasmoneans, the Egyptians, the Israelites, or any of the over thirty documented rulers who controlled the city on the hill for the last five thousand years. But no ruling power, including Jews, could claim the city’s special spirit. That belongs to no nation, no ruler, no power—no matter how much Jewish, Christian, Muslim, or any other creed try to call it their own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My family and I returned from our weekend away to tens of thousands of marchers who had spent four days making their way on foot from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The messianic fundamentalists who had brought this coalition into power were nowhere to be seen. But the pluralistic group of people who believed in an open society made the pilgrimage up to Mount Moriah to pray for the peace of the land. <em>Yerushalayim</em>, one of Jerusalem’s over seventy names, is based on a phrase meaning <em>a vision of peace</em>. It's meant to remind us that peace is ever within reach—if only we open our eyes.</p>

<p><strong>I WAS AT THE KICKOFF RALLY</strong> for the first Aldermaston March in 1958—the first march against nuclear weapons in England and the beginning of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. It was the foundational event for left-wing baby boomers in the UK and my own first step into politics. I was 14. I was there by accident, invited along by my surrogate family, the Abramskys, who lived at the bottom of our hill in Highgate, northwest London. The Abramskys were: Chimen, the father, a stout little Russian-Jewish gnome; Miriam, matching but motherly; and my buddy Jack. Chimen and Miriam<br>were old communists from the East End of London, where my family was also from, and they were the first of a long line of surrogate parents who put up with me during my adolescence. All of my surrogate parents were communists or ex-communists of one kind or another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was just into puberty at the Aldermaston rally and wearing my new duffle coat. I stuck my chest out and proudly displayed it to the marchers as they straggled out of Trafalgar Square to begin the four-day trek to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother had gone to Laura Place School in working-class Hackney with Miriam Abramsky and they had rekindled their friendship when my parents moved to Highgate in 1953. My father, prospecting for a house in some place quieter than the huge Edwardian house he’d leased cheaply in Notting Hill Gate during the war, ran into a herd of sheep coming down off Hampstead Heath into Highgate and decided immediately that this was the place for him. It wasn’t the place for my mother. She wanted to be on the other side of the Heath in Hampstead, where the intellectual life of London buzzed and where my parents had lived in the 1930s as students at the London School of Economics. In those days she taught English to glamorous, left-wing German refugees. (One of them was John Heartfield, the photo-collagist. Much later I saw my mother in an entirely new light when I heard her refer to Heartfield as “Johnny.”) Nevertheless, life in our family was organized around protecting my father’s peace of mind—he was the director of the Government Social Survey, a department of the Ministry of Information—and we ended up in Highgate. I spent my teenage years walking up and over the green hump of the Heath to Hampstead, where the action was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents did not come to that first Aldermaston rally in 1958. The official position in the family was that my father’s civil service job meant he had to keep his distance from politics. This wasn’t communicated directly because things weren’t communicated directly in our house, but as CND, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, became the focus of my teenage social life, I noticed that, unlike other parents, my parents never came to CND events. I knew this had something to do with the Communist Party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don’t know if my parents were ever actually in the Communist Party. If they were, they were probably long out of it by 1958. My father told me he joined when it looked like the Germans were going to invade England, because he thought the Communists were the only ones who would fight. But later, when I tried to check with James Jefferys, who had been London University Student Organizer for the CP in the ‘30s and was the uncle of my best friend Joe (named after Stalin), James said thoughtfully “Louis? No, no... Winnie, maybe.” I was staggered because I wasn’t accustomed to, or even capable of, thinking of my mother as the dynamic parent. But she was: She was a working-class girl from Hackney who had married up into the professional ranks. She would hate me saying she was working class, though I thought it was a credential, which annoyed her. The words “working class” made her toss her head in irritation, and one time when they came out of my mouth she thumped me on the arm in anger, a rare example of direct communication in our family and the closest she ever came to inflicting pain. I still find it hard to believe she was the one in the CP. But years later, when the MI5 surveillance files on my friend Joe’s aunt Nan drifted up into public view, there my mother was, in Nan’s phone taps, squabbling with the other surveillees over who would get the nice flat overlooking Primrose Hill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1958 my father’s brother Baron was probably still in what, in their branch of the family, they called “The Party.” Baron had been a miner and a CP branch secretary in the Nottinghamshire mines in World War II and then a graphic artist at the Daily Worker, the Communist Party newspaper (we received the Worker when I was a kid, but by 1958 it had disappeared from our doorstep). Nobody quite knew when Baron left the Party. His wife, my aunt Joan, left it around 1956 and my cousin, trying to figure out the mysteries of her family, obtained from her mother the following bizarre quote: “We never talked about those things.” Presumably by the 1960s, when Baron was organizing forecourt promotions for a large gas-station chain and driving around the suburbs in a Bentley, he was out. (He was also on the Nobility List at Fortnum and Mason’s, the classy department store in Piccadilly, because they thought he was The Baron Moss.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Baron had been a miner in the war (his helmet and lamp and his crossed hammer and pickaxe were displayed on the wall of their house in the stockbroker belt south of London), and because he went to meetings with the hard-nosed Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen when the British fascists were acting up, I gave him points over my father. Other uncles on both sides had been in the Air Force but my father was exempted because of his Civil Service job. I thought this was wimpy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a good thing your father didn’t have to go in the army,” my Aunt Anne said. “He’d never have been able to kill anyone.”</p>

<p>I had no social life in 1958 because I was at St Paul’s School, far away in Hammersmith, in west central London. I got up every morning, walked down Highgate West Hill to the 214 bus at Parliament Hill Fields and rode it to the Kentish Town underground station. Then I traversed diagonally across London by Northern line and Piccadilly line to Barons Court Station, then trudged past the Sadlers Wells Ballet School and around the St Paul’s playing fields to the school itself. Up on the second floor, in the big studio windows of the Ballet School, the Sadlers Wells students posed angelically. I would catch glimpses of them during rugby practice and think of them as higher beings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I liked going down into the warm and womblike embrace of the underground, although passengers would occasionally recognize the severe black St Paul’s blazer with its silver badge (and John Colet’s motto: <em>Fide et Literis</em>) and chide me for looking scruffy in public. I liked the underground because it had saved us Londoners in the war—though when I was a babe in arms during the V-1 attacks in 1944 my mother and her sister Molly had refused to go down into the deep Belsize Park station because it was too much trouble. (“What did you do?” I asked. “We got under the table.”) The underground was part of the nostalgic package we children of the ‘40s inherited from the war, along with the bomb sites down the street (two bombs in my childhood block in Notting Hill Gate) and the flowers of rose bay willow herb on the bomb sites and the gray dome of St Paul’s Cathedral rising triumphantly up over the bombed city. “Rubble children,” the Germans say: <em>trümmerkinder</em>. You could see the dome of St Paul’s from my bedroom on the Holly Lodge Estate, half way up Highgate West Hill, where I was experimenting with masturbation. (Here in California, all these years later, I miss the war. I miss that background melancholy that permeated everything in London when I was a child. I still think of myself as a son of the Northern line and I still feel safe in any city with an underground.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1957 I had moved over to the “big school,” the turreted, blackened, Gothic Revival St Paul’s main building, built in 1889 and destroyed a couple of years before John Betjeman made Victorian architecture fashionable. It loomed up over a nervous 13-year-old like Count Dracula’s castle. It was black like all the other public buildings in London. I thought they were supposed to be black. I was amazed when they cleaned up the Natural History museum and it turned out to be built of pale limestone with a delicate blue band along the facade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now in 1958, it was the age of Sputnik and at St Paul’s they wanted us to become scientists. Shortly after that first Aldermaston march, I announced I was going to be a nuclear physicist. I didn’t know what a nuclear physicist was and I didn’t connect it with what was happening behind the fence at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston (I was mostly in CND for the social life). My father, who approved of science, brought home the Ministry of Information What-is-Nuclear-Physics? pamphlet for me: I managed to avoid reading it. A few months later, when the Queen came to celebrate the school’s 450th anniversary, we scientists were hidden away in the lab of the junior school physics teacher Tombstone Peters, a stately man with the green-tinged face of a Hammer Films corpse, because we were swots who weren’t civilized enough to be presented to Her Majesty. The school built the regulation private toilet for her visit and painted the first floor of the blackened, gothic main building, the only floor she was going to be exposed to, in pastel colors. These incredible feminine touches, not like anything ever seen at St Paul’s, made us giggle and speculate about her private functions. This was early 1959 and I was still a sniggering little boy. But by the end of the year I had smoked my first joint.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the eleven plus exam—the exam that sorted you out for life in those days—most of my friends from north London had gone to the local independent school at the bottom of our hill. My friends at St Paul’s were a few swots who lived south of the river, which might as well have been Greenland for me. My social life consisted of occasionally going to Richmond to watch my classmate Ian digest food with his chemistry set, producing a brown sludge. On the way back from Ian’s—a long voyage across London in the top front seat of an empty double decker bus, out above the sodium-illuminated streets like the Flying Dutchman on his bridge—you had to watch out for random thugs looking for middle-class kids to intimidate. This was all part of London life, like playing English v. Germans on the bomb site at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shortly after First Aldermaston (as one came to call it) my mother figured things out. She put me in contact with a group of kids in northwest London whose parents had organized them into a social group called the “Chums.” The Chum parents were all communists or ex-communists: old LSE friends of my own parents, American refugees from the blacklisting in Hollywood and a group of South Africans, many of them well-padded doctors. Now that I think of it, I realize that it was my mother who was friendly with all the communists. The Chum parents were mostly Jewish. The South Africans lived in the affluent end of Hampstead near Finchley Road, a region I subconsciously identified as too Jewish. I understood Jewish geography. West Hampstead, where my grandmother had a baker’s shop, was marginal, but Golders Green was definitely too Jewish. I didn’t think of myself as Jewish because my self-image came from St Paul’s and schoolboy literature.</p>

<p>Well, I did. That was what St Paul’s did for me. I had decided I was going to assimilate. My role models came from Hotspur and Magnet, the antique weeklies that were still going strong 20 years after George Orwell wrote his famous essay on boys’ magazines. I was an aspiring British Gent. I was two thirds of a Public School Twit.</p>

<p>Some time in early 1959 my mother gave in to her Hampstead cravings and signed me up for the Rona Hart School of Ballroom Dancing in Gayton road, off Haverstock Hill, Hampstead’s main street. I walked there on Saturday afternoons, over the Heath then right at the mixed swimming pond on the Hampstead edge of the Heath and through the parking lot where the fair was held on August bank holidays. Then up the hill, past the architect Erno Goldfinger’s house with the sailboat in the window (my parents had modernist leanings and admired the house), then via the old Public Bathhouse to Gayton road, just below Hampstead Village. This was the Walk Past Paul’s House, the Swann’s Way of my youth. My friend Paul, at 40 Parliament Hill Road, had been signed up for the Rona Hart dancing school too but I was cruelly distancing myself from him as the Chums got more important in my life: Your parents weren’t in the CP!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The route by Paul’s house led onwards via Hampstead Village, where the Everyman Cinema was about to become the center of Chum life, to the home of my new surrogate family, the Jaffes. The Jaffes, replacing the Abramskys, were South African Chum parents who had left The Party at the time of Hungary and lived an expansive ex-colonial lifestyle over there by Finchley Road. I pretty much lived there myself on weekends, flirting with Peter Jaffe’s mother and admiring his father’s collection of modern paintings. Was it the expansiveness I liked or just the fact that they seemed to be a happy family? I was trying to get away from something pinched and crazy at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Peter Jaffe was at St Paul’s too but his strategy was different from mine. Since I was trying to pass I had signed up for everything, including rugby and the Cadet Corps. Well, everything except the Church of England, the one thing actually required for you to rise to the top. It was well known that a secret society of future rulers took confirmation breakfast together every month; you couldn’t get to be Head Boy if you weren’t one of them. The Cadet Corps was also necessary for success, but in the Cadet Corps at least you got to shoot guns. (This came in handy in California during the Sixties. In 1968 I was the only person in the Stanford SDS who had fired fully-automatic weapons.)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bravely, Peter Jaffe refused to join the Cadet Corps, marking himself as a Bolshevik, and spent Monday afternoons doing PT with a band of religious objectors and foreigners. I had to spend valuable weekend hours polishing brass and freezing the silicon shine on my boots in the refrigerator. If I was too stunned by a week of rugby, the Cadet Corps, and homework to walk to Rona Hart on Saturday afternoon, I would play on my mother’s guilt about sending me to St Paul’s in the first place and make her drive me around the south side of the Heath to Hampstead. She had a small, square, black Ford, one of the first cars on our street. She drove, my father didn’t. In fact she drove with aggression and finesse, and later she taught me to drive, her idea of teaching being to throw me into the insane central London traffic at Hyde Park Corner. My father’s not driving was a mark of his weirdness. He was from the Kafka generation, the oversensitive sons of successful Jewish businessmen. He’d had huge fights with his own roaring father and now, we were given to understand, he was to be treated gently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pubs on the walk past Paul’s house: the Magdala on Parliament Hill, with a bullet hole in the front where Ruth Ellis shot her lover, last woman to be executed in England. The hostile Railway Tavern in South End Green. The Freemasons on Downshire Hill (my mother liked the elegant Victorian houses on Downshire Hill with their filigree iron balconies). The Wells, the Flask (vaguely intellectual), the Cruel Sea (tourist), the White Bear (proletarian) and finally the Holly Bush, a low- ceilinged hobbit hole on Holly Bush Square at the top of the hill. The Holly Bush was the jumping-off point for the publess trek through leafy residential Hampstead to the Jaffes’ house near Finchley Road. I walked from the Holly Bush to the Jaffe’s because the walk was sociable, and also because by closing time I would be too drunk to ride a bicycle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The White Bear was the first pub that would serve us, beginning in the summer of 1959. It was a no-frills boozer in what was then the working class enclave of New End, above the Public Bath House. It was patronized by thin, stunned, narrow-chested men in flat caps who didn’t seem to mind 15-year old boys (unlike the Railway Tavern, where the clientele was younger and more aggressive). They reminded me of my grandfather in Brighton, an old soldier who had just died of lung cancer (gassed in World War I plus about a million roll-up cigarettes). I knew there was a class gulf between us and the relatives in Brighton; my mother would go down there and come back depressed because they wouldn’t take any money from her. But I went to my grandfather’s funeral wearing my St Paul’s black blazer anyway; I was so pleased with the blazer and its silver badge that I hardly realized he was dead. As at the Aldermaston rally, I was more interested in my clothes than in the event.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the White Bear, they would serve anybody. Later in 1959 I bought that first joint at the White Bear, from Mick Roach, a thug. Mick was also rumored to have a gun for sale. Although he was a thug he was one of our thugs because he had been at the Aldermaston March—Second Aldermaston by this time and the first time the march came back to London from Aldermaston, ending up with a tremendous crescendo in Trafalgar Square. We, the Chums, were on the march, escaping from home with our sleeping bags and rucksacks. Mick sold me a standard North London joint, carefully hand-assembled with mostly tobacco, a little hashish shaved in and a filter neatly inserted in the end. (My grandfather, who favored Rizla Red papers and Old Holborn tobacco, used a rolling machine.) The price of that first joint was two shillings, same as a pint of beer, and, of course, it had no effect. We talked casually about the Aldermaston March—or at least I was trying to be casual. Mick wondered if X had done it to Mary Jane Smithers with a right hand screw or a left hand screw that night on the march. He demonstrated and I flinched internally; I had tried to get it on with Mary Jane myself but she had asked “Are you a virgin?” and my confidence had collapsed. Of course I was a virgin.</p>

<p>At the Rona Hart School of Dancing I tensely held on to an equally tense fat girl while keeping my feet in the footprints of the foxtrot diagram in my head. I was too embarrassed to ditch her. Besides, the long-legged Hampstead girls were too classy for me. I knew I was the wrong sort of person at Rona Hart. Perhaps, I told myself, it was because we lived in desperately unhip Highgate; anyhow, I couldn’t see how to rise in the ranks. Fortunately, right about then, right about the moment I met the Chums, rock and roll kicked in. Paul bought two 78s, the first rock and roll records I ever saw: Jerry Lee Lewis’s “Great Balls of Fire” and the Big Bopper singing “Chantilly Lace.” I see, as in a dream, us ballroom-dancing students, magically transformed, waltzing anarchically up Haverstock Hill like the boys escaping from school in Jean Vigo’s <em>Zero de Conduite</em>, to merge with the Chums at the El Serrano coffee bar in Hampstead Village. “Peggy Sue” is on the jukebox:</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>Launched in 2021</strong> at the California College of the Arts, San Francisco, in robust rivalry with the world pandemic, our Centre for Aesthetics and Politics (CAP) hovers—like Sufi Ibn Arabi’s “<em>fedeli d’amore</em>”—in a perpetual state of “perplexment.” Perplexed by ambiguities within Frankfurt School Critical Theorist Walter Benjamin’s case against “aestheticization of politics” (<em>Ästhetisierung der Politik</em>) that he extracted from Fascism’s signal cunning to fascinate the masses with show, display, ornament while firming their chains of subordination to autocratic governance. Ambiguous because instead of wholesale denial of the entire apparatus of such possible exploitations of art and the aesthetic, Benjamin championed instead— whatever it might portend a cabalistic Marxist of Benjamin’s vintage— the “politicization of art” (<em>Politisierung der Kunst</em>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upon this airless confrontation of apparent opposites, post-World War II thought has rushed in to scatter its bevy of neologisms: “paraesthetics,” “aesthetic politics,” “aesthetic statism,” “aesthetic community,” even “kallipolis.” Perhaps the least tilted terms come from Michel Foucault when in his positive readings on behalf of a contemporary “aesthetics of existence” he has cheered on the “politico-aesthetic choice” for our contemporary ethical life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like most substantive movements of spirit the “aesthetic-political” carries its rousing origin. Confronted by the challenges of the French Revolution while appreciating its underlying republican motivations, German poet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller in 1794 rang out the aesthetic-political clarion call: “If one is ever to solve the problem of politics in practice he will have to approach it through the aesthetic, because it is beauty by which man makes his way to freedom.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strong words. Backed by considerable competence in Kantian aesthetics and poetic practice, Schiller fired up legions of European thinkers, poets and “free spirits” to carry through the vaster implications of his proposal over the next century, widening the goals of societal and political change to bring in such presumably creative dimensions as spontaneity, dance, performance, even Play. Yet vulnerable at the same time to the usual gamut of doubt, skepticism, and liberal caution uncomfortable with the positive tonalities to Schiller’s theory and rhetoric.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps with at least occasional good reason. Heading off our Special Section on aesthetics and politics in the postwar era, Martin Jay calls on the postwar aesthetics of the Frankfurt School’s prime “negative theorist” Theodor W. Adorno to bolster the case against directly politically redemptive resonances behind the works of artists by showing how Adorno’s sponsorship of idiosyncrasy for art, as against sublimation, successfully cuts off any promising cooperation between art and the political. For her part, Amy Sims thoughtfully explores politics and art in the context of revolution. Revolutionary leaders have recognized that the arts can be a powerful language in helping the disaffected visualize the possibility of transforming their “reality,” and have equally understood art as a social power capable of binding diverse social groups together into a common vision. They have used and abused the arts as an inspiration for change and as a force for control. Looking specifically at the process by which Mao Zedong’s call for a new, truly Chinese proletarian art in the postwar period degenerated during his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of 1966 into the simple propaganda of a political power grab, readers are invited to ponder the difference between art in service to a creative vision, and art as simply propaganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In qualified contrast Robert Pirro draws from Hannah Arendt’s postwar political philosophizing the benign inference, leavened by the lasting standard of the classical Greek polis, of an aesthetic judgment capable of formulating promising forms of democratic individuality and community. Acknowledging the intense political oppositions and violences of the late 1960s and 1970s while struck by the redemptive power of pop-rock musical creations during that same period, Peter Murphy explores some of the key factors that musically counter the dystopian tendencies in contemporary politics and allow for recognition of an “instinctive classicism” transcending “decadal vortices and critical divisions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our final contributions push the buttons of radical interpretation in significantly different rhetorical registers. Thomas Haakenson’s fervid endorsement of the effect of the postwar Black Arts Movement (BAM) stemming from Oakland, California to decolonize European monopoly over concepts of revolutionary artistic practices not only takes on central moments in that effort, but raises critical questions of what the concept of an artistic avant-garde might entail when widened beyond its historical European articulations. Conversely lowering tonalities, Lydia Degarrod imaginatively knits together poetic expression, historical narrative, and poignant imagery to evoke mourning over the ramifications of the nuclear destruction of Hiroshima for a family whose home it had once been, as she touches on the fragility of “dwelling in this world.” Discursively calling upon the resources of the poetical, Degarrod’s essay itself becomes poetry—a fitting resonance to close out our Special Section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That our contributors offer such disparate perspectives and positions to the proper relationship of art and politics need not surprise. Perhaps then the safest option that our maiden Special Section finally suggests is to adopt Foucault’s recommending the criterion of agonism as: “less of a face-to-face confrontation than a permanent provocation.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>""Artists do not sublimate,""</strong> Theodor W. Adorno, a leading member of the Frankfurt School, asserted in <em>Minima Moralia</em>, the collection of aphorisms he wrote in California during the postwar years and published in 1951. The idea “that they neither satisfy nor repress their desires, but translate them into socially desirable achievements, their works, is a psychoanalytic illusion... Their lot is rather a hysterically excessive lack of inhibition over every conceivable fear; narcissism taken to its paranoiac limit. To anything sublimated they oppose idiosyncrasies.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among the many inferences that can be drawn from this provocative statement, the one that previously drew my attention concerned the limits of Adorno’s acceptance of psychoanalytic theory. Despite his general blessing of the arranged “marriage of Freud and Marx” sought by the Frankfurt School, when it came to aesthetic creativity, he balked at the reduction of works of art to the transfigured psychological fantasies of their creators. For to do so would both spiritualize the unfulfilled needs of the desiring body and turn works of art into affirmative consolations for the actual denial of those needs. It would also disregard the integrity of works of art as more than the projected daydreams of artists, and thus rob them of the ability to challenge the status quo through their formal qualities and material non-identity with the constitutive subject. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As it happened, there was a place for sublimation in Adorno’s understanding of art, albeit not of transfigured libidinal desires. He claimed instead that artworks sublimate suffering rather than desire, and that the posterior aestheticizations of prior devotional or cult objects could be seen as sublimations of the original mimetic impulses indirectly preserved in them. But what I want to address now is something entirely different: the implications for the relationship between art and politics in his ancillary claim that what artists really do is oppose their idiosyncrasies to sublimation. Valorizing idiosyncrasy was, in fact, a frequent gesture in Adorno’s work, and has been recognized as well in the work of other Frankfurt School figures. Walter Benjamin, a heterodox member of the School, has been praised for his “aesthetics of idiosyncrasy,” and Axel Honneth, the leading member of the School’s third generation, argued for “Idiosyncrasy as a Tool of Knowledge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the literary critic Jan Plug warns in an insightful discussion of the role played by “idiosyncrasy” in the Frankfurt School’s analysis of anti-Semitism, treating it as a positive concept is futile, even impossible, for once it becomes a generic category, it performatively contradicts what it substantively seeks to promote: the need to subvert abstract conceptualizations. “And yet,” he writes, “this impossibility remains an absolute necessity for any possibility of liberating societies from anti-Semitism.” It marks “the limits of conceptuality. Thus it posits an irrecuperable outside, in fact the idiosyncratic as that very outside. The idiosyncratic, then, demands its conceptualization (destined to ‘failure’ as it is) in order to posit itself as such, as idiosyncratic to that very theorizing.” Idiosyncrasy, in fact, functions in Adorno’s “negative dialectics” as a synonym for “non-identity” and “non-conceptuality.” Resisting the logic of subsumption, fungibility and commodification, it apophatically gestures to what it cannot positively signify without contradicting itself performatively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In their analysis of anti-Semitism in <em>Dialectic of Enlightenment</em>, Adorno and his colleague Max Horkheimer interpret hatred of the Jews as a primary example of the intolerance of idiosyncrasy, the pressure to eradicate the non-identical in the name of totalizing identity, understood in communal, national and racial terms. Freedom from anti-Semitism is thus entangled with the even more ambitious task of undoing the damages of identitarian totalization in whatever form it may appear. Among its manifestations, they argue, is the ideal of a fully integrated, balanced, autonomous subject, which is able to master the unruly demands of nature both within and without.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Jews, to the extent that they have resisted the possessive individualism of bourgeois culture and retained a trace of the 15 mimetic comportment that the instrumentalization of reason sought<br>to snuff out, can be said to embody a particularity that is not limited<br>by propriety. That is, they have escaped being caught in the trap of the entirely immanent subjectivity posited as a normative ideal in Western thought ever since Descartes by never fully assimilating to the dominant norms of the cultures in which they find themselves. To quote Plug once again, “understood in this way, not only as a simple <em>resemblance</em> or <em>adaptation</em> but as the mechanism by which these are achieved, idiosyncratic mimesis denotes the moment at which the subject is no longer, or not yet, a subject. It marks, at the very least, the body’s escape from intentionality, the body’s <em>freedom</em> and <em>independence</em> from subjectivity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is not the place to evaluate Horkheimer and Adorno’s characterization of the Jews or their explanation of the sources of anti- Semitism. Whether or not they escape the trap of positing yet another version of the “the figural Jew,” to borrow Sarah Hammerschlag’s term for metaphoric interpretations that homogenize the disparate realities of actually existing Jews, is not something we can adjudicate now. What is more important for our purposes is to note their claim that the idiosyncratic qualities of the Jews, so often denounced by their enemies, reflect a kind of non-intentional adaptation that never turns into a perfect duplication of what is resembled mimetically. For what this stubborn refusal to jettison idiosyncrasy in the service of subjective integration helps us to understand is the logic behind Adorno’s rejection of Freud’s theory of sublimation to explain artistic creativity. That is, when he links that creativity with hysteria, paranoia, the overcoming of inhibitions and extreme narcissism, he is arguing that the artist—like the unassimilated Jew—should never be understood as a balanced, self-possessed subject able to transfigure his unruly desires in the service of cultural transcendence. Although Adorno and Horkheimer do not address the Zionist alternative that sought to integrate Jews into a society and polity of their own making, the logic of their argument is that it too would entail a loss of that idiosyncratic resistance to sublimation they so highly valued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Casting doubt on the actual existence of such an integrated subject, not to mention positing it as a normative ideal, of course, became commonplace in late twentieth-century theory, even in the psychoanalysis of Lacan and others. Whether or not this implies that all of us are inherently no less idiosyncratic than Adorno’s artists and that those who claim to possess integrated, sublimating subjectivities are actually ideologically deluded (remaining in Lacanian terms at the mirror stage rather than taking on the full implications of entering into the symbolic) is difficult to say. What is more certain, it seems to me, are the implications that can be drawn for the relationship between art and politics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Frankfurt School always argued that marginality might provide a critical vantage point on the status quo. In his essay on “Idiosyncrasy as a Tool of Knowledge,” Honneth continues this tradition: “The disposition social criticism requires is the hypertrophic, the idiosyncratic view of those who see in the beloved everyday of the institutional order the abyss of failed sociality, in routinized differences of opinion the outlines of collective delusion.” He adds that idiosyncratic social criticism requires the help of theory to challenge the assumptions underlying conventional wisdom and the naturalization of historically variable givens. In this sense, it complements the rejection of culturally affirming sublimation that Adorno attributes to idiosyncratic artistic creativity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how, we must ask, does idiosyncrasy serve to enable the political action that can lift us out of the “abyss of failed sociality” that is the deeper truth underlying the ideological “beloved everyday of the institutional order?” Although artistic creation, like theoretically informed social criticism, may ultimately inspire action in the political realm, neither, after all, is directly equivalent to transformative political praxis itself. Nor can praxis be reduced to “applied” theory or the literal realization of aesthetic imagination, as if it were simply following a recipe to cook a meal. Despite the glib slogan that “everything is political,” it is important to avoid reducing everything to a night in which all cows are black.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his essay on “Idiosyncrasies: Of Anti-Semitism,” Jan Plug attempts to address this issue by invoking the distinction, originated by Carl Schmitt and popularized by a number of European theorists in the 1980’s, between <em>die Politik</em> and <em>das Politische</em>, <em>la politique</em> and <em>le politique</em>, and <em>la politica</em> and <em>il politico</em>. The first term of each pair is normally translated into English as “politics,” while the second, based on the portentous translation of an adjective into a noun, has become “the political.” Whereas the former implies the messy, mundane realm of electoral contests, coalition-building, legislation, policy-making, and transactional compromises, the latter suggests a purer, even ontological rather than ontic realm where the agonistic struggle for power is an end in itself. Referring to the way in which the dominance of the centered, coherent, autonomous subject is undermined by the unsublatable impulses of the body expressed by idiosyncratic behavior, Plug argues that:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">It leaves open the space, the very space of a radical mind/body split, that refigures the political space as other than the site of labor or “political” action as it is customarily conceived. This is the space of the political, the opening without which political action in this narrower sense could never be thought, the space of the political as the resistance to the logic that allows for the subsumption of body to mind, for subsumption <em>tout court</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we replace “subsumption” with “sublation,” both of which contain and domesticate the expression of idiosyncratic, corporeal impulses, we can see the way in which Adorno’s dictum about artistic creativity may suggest an affinity between art and a certain ontological notion of “the political.” In both, the autonomous, centered subject is denigrated in favor of the impersonal, often erratic forces that disrupt settled order and challenge reified categories, opening a “space” for something radically new to appear. Rather than a takeover of one by the other—either the “aestheticization of politics” or the “politicization of art” famously posited by Benjamin as a fateful choice—each is valued for sharing a common potential for liberating transgression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But is the putative commensurability of art and “the political,” we have to wonder, really sufficient? If “idiosyncrasy” is understood to be an “impossible” concept, always gesturing to its “outside,” how does it comport with what at least in Schmitt’s usage was defined precisely as “<em>the concept</em> of the political?” Can one, moreover, pass so easily from the everyday world of mundane “politics as usual”, with all of its tawdry compromises and disappointing imperfections, to a purer, more essential alternative that, like artistic creation, opens a space for idiosyncratic freedom from constraint, institutional as well as conceptual? However laudable heroic resistance to subsumption and sublimation may be, it is hard to imagine it serving as the basis for viable action in the everyday world of <em>die Politik, la politique</em> or <em>la politica</em>. If we identify the latter with what Hannah Arendt famously called “acting in concert” or more narrowly in terms of the “deliberative democracy” based on rational discussion advocated by Jürgen Habermas, it may well be necessary to valorize the intersubjective ability to achieve consensus through persuasion or even the transactional skills of compromise. These may well involve a certain culturally acceptable sublimation of libidinal and other demands of the body, including ones that express aggressive feelings. The results are likely to frustrate hopes of opening a new political space for radical change. But can we, at a time when Donald Trump has shown us all too clearly what a de-sublimated politics looks like, be so confident that it will automatically have more emancipatory effects?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much more can be said about all of these issues. But what seems clear in conclusion is that if Adorno is right about artistic creation’s reliance on idiosyncratic resistance to sublimation and the expression of “narcissism taken to its paranoiac limit,” it is not surprising that a perennial tension exists between art and politics. Or at least it does so when the latter is understood in its imperfect quotidian form rather than as the idealized notion of “the political.” Although a passage from one to the other may be fashioned, it is never smooth or without intractable contradictions. Poets, <em>pace</em> Shelley, are not really the “unacknowledged legislators of the world,” nor should we expect them to be. Despite the yearnings of those from Friedrich Schiller on who dream of a harmonious conflation of the two, the idea of an “aesthetic state” may well therefore remain an oxymoronic impossibility. And thankfully so.</p>

<p><strong>Why are revolutionary leaders</strong> intent on the control of culture, especially art and artists, as a vital aspect of their revolution? Mao’s discontinuity from using art to help create a communist society to weaponizing art in his power struggle to establish totalitarian control during the Great Proletarian Revolution raises several questions including: Where is the line between art in service to a cause and art as propaganda?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Revolutionary leaders suppose themselves to be engaged in creating a better future, and believe that “reality” is malleable, something that can be demolished and reconstructed. They clear the way for this destruction and rebuilding by promoting a sense of boundless possibility or what historian Robert Darnton calls “possibilism” which they offer in contrast to widespread discontent with existing conditions. As revolutionaries, they try to frame reality by articulating existing problems, specifying the next steps that need to be taken, and using forms of visual culture (as a powerful form of communication), to weave together a common goal capable of binding diverse societal groups. In his article “Nomos and Narrative,” law professor Robert Cover explains that in any given society there is a nomos or a vision of an ideal social order that laws are expected to create. And behind every nomos is a narrative clarifying how the creators of that society envision the ideal they want to build, a vision to inspire people and explain why they should do what is expected of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chairman Mao Zedong wanted to create such a nomos (with art as a crucial aspect of it) to advance the cause of his revolution in China. He believed that art is a social power, that artists are transmitters of cultural values, and that art can help prepare the ideological groundwork for creating a new national will and a new vision of people to inhabit a new, utopian Communist community. Mao repudiated a traditional view (as expressed by Thomas Mann and many others) that art is the ultimate form of independent creativity, eternal, concerned with beauty, and demanding unhindered expression. As Goethe had put it, a good work of art can have moral consequences, but to demand moral or political intentions from artists is to ruin their work. Mao, on the other hand, saw art as an instrument of control, a way of first persuading, and later intimidating the Chinese public. He had no doubt that art served ideology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike another 20th century revolutionary dictator, Adolf Hitler, whose passion for the visual arts was intense, Mao had no deep interest in music, painting, sculpture or architecture. He did have some interest in poetry, calligraphy, and western ballroom dancing (primarily with underage teenage girls), but he did not consider himself an artist of any sort; his interest in art was pragmatic. While hunkered down in Yan’an at the conclusion of his Long March, and confident of the ultimate success of his revolution, Mao articulated his expectations for Chinese artists. In a series of lectures in 1942 and published the following year as <em>Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art</em>, Mao declared that there is no such thing as art for art’s sake and that all literature and art belong to definite classes and are geared to specific political aims. Artists must form a “cultural army” to ensure that “literature and art fit well into the whole revolutionary machine as a component part, that they operate as powerful weapons for uniting and educating the people, for attacking and destroying the enemy, and for helping the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pointing out that 90% of the population of China were workers, soldiers, and peasants, he argued that art should be geared expressly for them because they are the class that leads the revolution. But the problem facing workers, soldiers, and peasants, according to Mao, was that they were illiterate and uneducated as a result of many years of rule by the feudal and bourgeois classes. Consequently, they were eagerly demanding education and works of art that were easily understandable, that would strengthen their enthusiasm for struggle, and that would build their confidence in victory against the enemy. Artists must therefore shift their allegiance away from petty bourgeois reactionaries and move to the side of the people through the process of studying Marxism-Leninism. Only in that way, Mao asserted, will China develop a truly proletarian art—an art that creates characters out of the real life of people suffering from cold, hunger, and oppression, and that helps the masses to propel history forward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Mao’s proclamation in Tiananmen Square of The People’s Republic of China in 1949, he could actually accomplish his goal of creating a new visual culture for a new China, art that was accessible, no longer just for the wealthy elite but for all the people. Socialist realism was introduced in the 1950s by Chinese artists who had been sent to Russia to be trained in oil painting, while Soviet artists such as the famed Konstantin Maksimov came to the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing to train Chinese artists in Russian style realism. Paintings in this new style were reproduced as posters and widely distributed to factories and workplaces so that this new visual culture could permeate everyday life. Previously, almost all the important teachers at Chinese Art academies had studied overseas in Europe or Japan and the Chinese Art schools structured their curricula to resemble those of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris or the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. Now under Mao, however, Socialist style oil painting was promoted as a replacement for the centuries- old Chinese art of ink painting which was seen as too elitist and as the product of the rotten old society that needed to be replaced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All Chinese Art academies established Communist Party committees that had top level decision-making power in all matters. New courses such as the political history of the Chinese Communist party, and dialectical materialism, became a required part of the curriculum. Political campaigns were used by the CCP as a means to attack and purge those with different viewpoints. One early example was the “Purge Counterrevolutionary Elements” campaign (1950) during which students were expected to spend entire days facing the designated counterrevolutionary targets and denouncing them instead of attending classes. Also newly required for both students and teachers was the obligation to “enter deeply into life” by spending some weeks or months each year in farming villages or factories to collect material for depicting “real people” in their creative works. Of this time, Zheng Shengtian (a 1958 graduate of, and then professor at, the Zhejiang Art Academy) later wrote (as co-curator of the New York 2008 exhibition “The Art of China’s Revolution”) that for young people like himself, it was a dynamic and idealistic time. The Communist vision of a harmonious, classless society appealed to him and his fellow students, and the idea of creating a new art was something that resonated with their idealistic aspirations. Art was placed in service to an ideology in which they believed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Art and all aspects of Chinese culture changed when Mao launched his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966— ostensibly to prevent China from deserting the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist path, but in actuality a pure and simple power grab by Mao having nothing to do with sustaining communist principles. In the aftermath of Mao’s failed second Five Year Plan, “The Great Leap Forward” (1958-1963) during which 45 million people were disastrously killed in the worst man-made famine in history, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping and Vice Chairman of the CCP Liu Shaoqi advocated more moderate and practical policies (that were highly successful). When Nikita Khrushchev denounced his predecessor, Stalin, first in his “secret speech” at the closed 1956 Soviet Party Congress, then repeated publicly at the open 1961 session, and began a process of de-Stalinization, Mao became paranoid that he would meet the same fate as Stalin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Under the pretext of preventing “reactionary bourgeois revisionists” from undermining Communism, Mao launched the Great Proletarian Cultural revolution as an instrument to remove power from the CCP in order to reassert absolute loyalty and power to himself. The two intertwined elements of the revolution were creating a cult of Mao and emphasizing class struggle to ferret out class enemies (some of whom were his closest comrades). China had been governed for more than 2000 years by an emperor who was revered as both leader of the country and its spiritual authority. Mao appropriated this tradition, appearing “godlike” by remaining remote and mysterious while expecting others to implement his goals, and “revered political leader” by promoting hatred of class enemies as “capitalist roaders, ox devils and snake demons” who would certainly drag China back to the bad old days of the Kuomintang were it not for Mao’s leadership. Art was weaponized to play a role in both facets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To enable his Cultural Revolution, in May 1966 Mao set up a powerful new body, the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG) which had direct control over culture and which consisted of strong Mao loyalists: Jiang Qing (his wife), Chen Boda (his personal secretary), Kang Shen (his intelligence chief) and Zhang Chunqiao (writer and propagandist). He also worked with Defense Minister Lin Biao to promote the cult of Mao in the People’s Liberation Army. The Cultural Revolution began later that month when faculty at Beijing University created the first big wall poster (dazibao) criticizing university administrators for trying to suppress the impending revolution. Immediately hundreds of such character posters sprang up all over the university and at other schools. Schools and universities suspended classes but mandated that students remain on campus to engage in revolutionary activities. Art magazines and art journals stopped publication to encourage art students to engage in creating posters and lead “struggle sessions” and denunciations. Groups of armed Red Guards (teenagers, typically the children of high communist officials who were self-appointed revolutionaries and were granted Mao’s “warm and fiery support”) searched homes and studios, smashed antiques, pianos, violins, and records, tore up paintings, toppled statues, and raided museums, palaces, temples, ancient tombs, pagodas, and tea houses. Mao had also instructed that grass, flowers, and pets were bourgeois habits and were eliminated by the Red Guards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Authors Jung Chang and Gao Yuan, former Red Guards, gave detailed accounts in their books (<em>Wild Swans</em> and <em>Born Red</em>) of the epidemic of scapegoating and widespread random violence that swept China during the Cultural Revolution. Professors and artists, along with communist officials, were the most frequent targets—they were beaten, sometimes fatally, forced to kneel on broken glass, have ink poured on their heads and faces (to turn them black, the designated color of the class of landlords and counter-revolutionaries), forced to remain for hours in the painful “jet plane” position (pushed to one’s knees, arms twisted and pushed up behind the back as if to dislocate them), confined in cowsheds and other “prisons” where they were tortured, had their heads shaved in yin-yang patterns, and paraded through the streets with dunce caps on their heads and slogans written all over their bodies. Many artists, forced to witness their work being destroyed, committed suicide. Famous traditional artists such as ink painters Lin Fengmian, Li Keran, and Pan Tianshou are examples of those who were denounced as class enemies and badly treated because of their age and level of expertise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Red Guards vowed to “launch a bloody war against anyone who dares to resist the Cultural Revolution, who dares to oppose Chairman Mao,” and enthusiastically carried out Mao’s command to destroy the “four olds”—old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. The expectation of enemy figures had been planted in the population, and it was necessary to find and destroy them. For the Red Guards, a proper revolutionary was aggressive and cruel to class enemies; any form of humane consideration was considered bourgeois. Every morning or evening, the Red Guards made “a report to Mao” by gathering in front of his portrait, waving his <em>Little Red Book</em> above their heads, and wishing him an infinitely long life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artists participated in creating the cult of Mao by displaying their approved works in art exhibitions. In February 1967 more than 20 Beijing colleges provided art works for the exhibition at the Beijing Observatory, “Smash the Lui Shaoqi-Deng Xiaoping Counterrevolutionary Line.” The exhibition began with a quotation from Mao and the first work displayed was a portrait of Mao waving his hand in a gesture that symbolized his leadership in launching the Cultural Revolution. A brief sample of exhibitions held thereafter is: “Long Live the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought” (National Art Museum); “Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” (Tiananmen Square) which had more than 16,000 works on display; and “Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao’s Revolutionary Line” (National Art Museum). These exhibitions then traveled to factories, communes, and army units.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Red Sea” (<em>hong haiyang</em>) was an artist’s movement to create and spread Mao’s image everywhere (including schools, farms, factories, villages, offices, and newspapers) and turned Mao into the main subject of the art of the Cultural Revolution. Red Guards in the Central Academy of Fine Arts published a small booklet in 1967 that consisted of 54 woodcuts of Mao and it became the most important source for portraits of Mao. The most influential and the most frequently copied of all Mao images during the Cultural Revolution was a woodcut by Shen Yaoyi, “Chairman Mao Waves, We Move Forward” which depicts Mao’s first meeting with Red Guards at Tiananmen Gate in 1966. Many other influential images of Mao during this period came from Shan Yaoyi’s woodblocks and were present everywhere: The surface of nearly every public space in China was covered with portraits of Mao along with his quotations, no one could dare to discard old newspapers for fear of being labeled counter-revolutionary because every front page had a picture of Mao and every few lines of print were quotations from Mao. Propaganda posters became the most widespread form of visual art, most of them reproductions of paintings from the major exhibitions. One of the most famous paintings was Tang Xiaohe’s “Strive Forward With Wind and Tides,” depicting an energetic Mao waving after he completed his famous swim in the Yangzi River. Although Mao actually swam with his bodyguards, in the painting he is surrounded by Red Guards, workers, and soldiers. The point was to depict Mao’s vigor and suitability for leadership, and his close connection to the fervor of the Red Guards. As Kuiyi Shen has written for the “Art and China’s Revolution” exhibition, one of the hallmarks of the Cultural Revolution was that all art was propaganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the death of Mao in 1976, the Cultural Revolution ended with the arrest of the CRG, including Mao’s wife Jiang Qing. Former Red Guards Jung Chang and Gao Yun quoted people they encountered during the revolution: “What revolution? Do you call what you are doing revolution? It’s beating, smashing, and looting” (Gao); and “there is nothing cultural about it! There is only brutality” (Jung Chang). Departing from his initial vision of using art to destroy the old to establish the new, Mao destroyed much of China’s cultural heritage without constructing anything new, and he weaponized art as a helpful means to do so. There is indeed a difference between art in service to a cause and totalitarian control of art as propaganda.</p>

<p><strong>HANNAH ARENDT: DEFINING THE POSTWAR AESTHETIC POLITICALLY RATHER THAN GEOPOLITICALLY</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In locating the postwar era </strong>between the years 1945 and 1991, convention has defined that period as one primarily structured by the ideological struggle between two globally-active nuclear powers who manage to compete politically, economically, and militarily for almost a half century without destroying one another or humanity. That world of bipolar rivalry and contention between the United States and the Soviet Union, which began after the final defeat of Nazi Germany facilitated the parting of these strange bedfellows and ended when one of them gave up the ghost, left its mark on major developments of postwar American society and politics, including the rise of the national security state, saber rattling nuclear confrontations, costly political and military interventions across the world, and the space race. A postwar seen through the perspective of Hannah Arendt’s thought would not be defined by the drama of superpower rivalry but by a drama of human agency bounded by world historical developments demonstrating how concerted action could extinguish individual freedom, at the start of the period, and, at its end, promote individual freedom’s fullest political expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arendt’s career as an American political theorist began in the mid-1940s as she endeavored to understand in real time Nazi Germany’s unprecedented continent-wide campaign to exterminate European Jews. In important respects, that career had its posthumous culmination more than forty years later with the peaceful self- mobilization of ordinary citizens against Communist authoritarian regimes across Central and Eastern Europe, a development whose fullest significance Arendt’s works of the 1950s and 1960s prepared us to see. In aiming to teach her readers and listeners to recognize the existential significance of politics, Arendt developed an aesthetically-attuned form of political reflection fundamentally different in its premises and approach from the realist, liberal and Marxist scholarship of her day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Arendt never formulated her thought under the rubric of “aesthetic politics,” the distinctiveness of her political theory can be understood by appreciating its concern with both the aesthetic dimensions of politics and the political dimensions of aesthetics. Deeply informed by a youthful immersion in ancient Greek poetry and inspiring personal exposure to the philhellenic ruminations of Martin Heidegger on the disclosive aspects of “Being,” Arendt came to see politics as an activity whose existential significance was crucially dependent on the presence and response of actor- spectators relating to each other and to a world modified by their interactions. Guided in part by Immanuel Kant’s modeling of the faculty of judgment, she sought to emphasize what we might call the political dimensions of aesthetics by calling attention to how spectatorship of, and involvement in, public affairs served to invite plurally-situated actor-spectators to share and compare judgments of political events and developments. In general, her unique approach to understanding politics and its significance for human life enables us to define the postwar, one might say, <em>aesthetic</em>-politically rather than geo-politically.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arendt’s fullest appreciation of the aesthetic dimensions of politics or the disclosive effects of political spectatorship was preceded and importantly shaped by her confronting the radical scope of Nazi Germany’s attack on European Jewry. While reports of Nazi massacres of Jews began to appear in American news columns in 1942 and were urgently discussed in the intellectual and social networks of New York City in which the newly arrived refugee Arendt came to participate, what would become known as the Holocaust did not become front page news in the United States until after elements of Patton’s Sixth Armored Division stumbled upon the concentration camp at Buchenwald in April 1945 and Eisenhower arranged for a group of influential journalists and editors to tour the deadly facilities at Buchenwald, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen. Once Arendt set to work on understanding what had happened to European Jewry during the war, she was faced with a fundamental problem: how to understand the Nazi fixation on exterminating every single Jew in Europe, from infants to the oldest seniors, even when the pursuit of this continent- spanning mass murder project undermined Nazi military efforts. To her mind, this phenomenon was so unprecedented in its apparent irrationality that it resisted conventional modes of understanding and common sense. “The incredibility of the horrors is closely bound up with their economic uselessness. The Nazis carried this uselessness to the point of open anti-utility when in the midst of war, despite the shortage of building material and rolling stock, they set up enormous, costly extermination factories and transported millions of people back and forth.” Her response to this challenge was to engage in “an historical investigation that employs imagination consciously as an important tool of cognition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In her first major American work of political theory, <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em> (1951), Arendt located the radical novelty of Nazi evil in the regime’s establishment of an institution—the Nazi concentration and extermination camp system—which defied all precedents. “The camps are meant not only to exterminate people and degrade human beings, but also to serve the ghastly experiment of eliminating, under scientifically controlled conditions, spontaneity itself as an expression of human behavior and of transforming the human personality into a mere thing.” With the concentration camp’s establishment of an environment of “absolute terror,” Arendt suggests that we had passed an existential threshold; culturally educated Europeans, living in a highly differentiated society with a complex division of labor, and employing the highest levels of technical proficiency, had organized a form of collective life aimed at eliminating human spontaneity and making individual human beings absolutely superfluous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One indicator in Arendt’s breakthrough book of her appreciation of the radical challenge posed to existing modes of understanding, whether in the form of conventional political analysis or traditional categories of political philosophy or even popular common sense, was her adoption of narrative techniques lending themselves more to literature and the arts than to the behavioralist modes of analyzing large scale patterns of behavior then coming into vogue in academic social science. She drew upon the fictive worlds of novelists to call attention to the circulation of racist and imperialist ideas in Europe later picked up by totalitarian ideologies. She also employed narrative devices such as oxymoron and moral hyperbole to evoke the denaturing cruelty of the camp system. In addition, she evoked the history of Western art (“medieval pictures of Hell”), tropes of Expressionist film (“gruesome crimes in a phantom world”), and devices of Gothic narrative (“an evil spirit gone mad”), to muster a sense of the unprecedented and disorienting horror of the conditions and effects of the concentration and extermination camps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In theoretically confronting the experience of totalitarian domination in these unconventional ways, Arendt’s work of the 1940s and early 1950s called for a political response attentive to how radical attacks on human individuality and solidarity in Europe undermined prevailing categories of understanding in the West. Her assessment of the epistemological challenge raised by the advent of totalitarian mass murder would eventually find expression in thought-provoking recommendations to acknowledge the loss of “the Ariadne thread of tradition,” to confront “the abyss of freedom,” and to “think without a banister.” In these theoretical moves, she anticipated the later emergence in postwar American academia of intellectual movements (among whose avatars were Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Richard Rorty) which challenged the foundationalist premises of American philosophy, political and social theory, and the humanities, more generally. Eventually turning in her work to notions of aesthetic judgment as a way of conceptualizing viable forms of democratic individuality and community—“it is as though taste decides not only how the world is to look, but also who belongs in it”—Arendt can also be seen to anticipate postmodernism’s robust influence in the fields of aesthetics and cultural theory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Arendt, who died in 1975, did not have the opportunity to engage with the arrivals of postmodernism and deconstructionism on American shores. And, anyway, her theoretical interests remained focused on the status of, and prospects for, pluralistic and meaningful political agency in the aftermath of Nazism’s catastrophically murderous rule. Mapping out the Western tradition’s ordering of human activities in <em>The Human Condition</em> (1958), she moved on to excavate the founding moments of the American republic in <em>On Revolution </em>(1963) for insight into how a politics of voluntary concerted action carried out by strongly individuated citizens might be reinvigorated and disseminated in the modern world. Her discovery in that latter book of a lost tradition of revolutionary agency signaled a homecoming of sorts, whereby she connected the revolutionary actions of late colonial British North Americans with the activities of political councils and clubs spontaneously formed during European revolutions from 1789 onward. This theoretical work enabled her later to recognize and mostly welcome the popular mobilizations of the 1960s, whether for civil rights or against the war in Vietnam, as yet another discovery by everyday people of the joys of “public happiness,” that when a person “takes part in public life he opens up for himself a dimension of human experience that otherwise remains closed to him and that in some way constitutes a part of complete happiness.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No less significant in her book on the American revolution was her choice to conclude it with an extended quotation, in ancient Greek script no less, of choral verse and dialogue from Sophocles’ tragedy, <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em>. This return to the Greek poetry which she had loved from the time of her youth hinted at the never fully realized aesthetic- political basis of her theoretical affirmation of living a life of public action and commitment: the ancient Greek civic institution of tragic theater. To be sure, her many, scattered references to the characters, plot lines, and language of Greek tragedy and its successors and to the various theorizations of the political significance of that performative and literary tradition were never developed into a systematic theory of the politics of tragedy. Perhaps she was too mindful of the possibility that German intellectuals’ long standing attentiveness to tragedy and tragic forms of thought may have facilitated German citizens’ moral collapse and abdication of political responsibility under the Nazis. In seeming recognition of this danger, she chose her words carefully in her wartime and early postwar essays and preferred such terms as “catastrophe,” “annihilation,” or “destruction” to “tragedy” when referring to the consequences of Nazi rule. Yet, toward the close of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Arendt’s theorization of a participatory vision of politics, in which political action and relationships unfolded in a public space between plurally-situated citizens, was accompanied by proliferating references to elements of Greek tragedy, its modern successors and to the traditions of criticism inspired by them. These references enrich our understanding of Arendt’s formulation of the “space of appearance,” “where everything that appears in public can be seen and heard by everybody and has the widest possible publicity.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Arendt analogized the space of appearance manifested by concerted action to the tragic theater in several ways. In places, she reworks Aristotelian concepts related to Greek tragedy, including catharsis, pathos, and drama, to emphasize the profound emotional rewards promised when one engaged in free political action with one’s peers. In other places, she mentions tragic characters or cites tragic verse to suggest the lasting dignity of even failed attempts at concerted action in order to hold out historically-fleeting episodes of citizen activism as both a consolation for great political disappointments and as an inspiration for future attempts at exercising political freedom. In the background of all of these evocations of the politics of tragedy was the exemplary role played by Greek tragedy in fostering the emotional self-possession, civic solidarity, and political education of citizens of ancient Athenian <em>demokratia</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Had she lived long enough, Arendt would have appreciated how the 1989-1990 collapse of Soviet-style Communism in the face of increasing popular mobilization vindicated the answer Sophocles’ Theseus gave to the pessimistic wisdom of the tragic chorus of <em>Oedipus at Colonus</em>, “Not to be born prevails over all meaning uttered in words.” His answer, that “it was the polis, the space of men’s free deeds and living words, which could endow life with splendor,” serving as it did as a coda to her 1963 book on revolution, would have served her equally well in explaining the willingness of hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens to engage in political action and risk arrest, injury, or worse as participants in Solidarity and Citizens’ Committees in Poland, the Committee for Historical Justice in Hungary, the church peace prayers held in East Germany, the Civic Forum in Czechoslovakia, as well as the Roundtable discussions, negotiations, meetings and marches across all of these countries. In them, Arendt would have seen resonant expressions of the popular genius for political self-mobilization and self-organization whose historical remnants she had traced in the revolutionary tradition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the world-transforming emergence of those councils, she, who had faulted the American founders for failing to provide the revolutionary spirit with a lasting institution, would have also anticipated what was to happen in the aftermath of the revolutions of 1989-90. The robust forums of public protest, discussion, and discussion, which had been formed by the mostly spontaneous action of so many ordinary citizens in Central and Eastern European countries and which had led to the dissolution of longstanding authoritarian regimes, were replaced by parliamentary democracies, one of whose primary interests lay in narrowing citizens’ political agency to the act of voting in periodic elections. Living as we do in an era when the transactional spirit of representative politics has facilitated ever deepening levels of corruption among political elites and an ever spreading sense of alienation among citizens, we could do worse than to revisit Arendt’s salutary vision of a public realm of free citizens actively engaged in shaping their common life.</p>

<p><strong>Politics divide while music unites.</strong> This is a truism that also happens to be true. Take the case of the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was an era of intense political divisions. Mass protests, vociferous polemics, and political violence were common. Yet the soundtrack to the era was filled with gorgeous harmonies and infectious rhythms that became, in time, a widely-shared culture. Its legacy is one of the few bits of common culture today that transcends political and moral divisions. 1965 to 1975 was an exceptional time of musical creation. A rich vein of pop-rock music rose to the surface. Like all golden ages, this one was short-lived yet its influence continues to reverberate decades later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you observe politics for long enough you begin to realize that it is decadal in nature. In my life-time we have segued through the anti-communist 1950s, the anti-war 1960s, the militant 1970s, the free-market 1980s, the information age 1990s, the terror-inflected 2000s and the populist 2010s. For sure there are continuities in politics. But those more often than not are continuities of division. We disagree and we repeat <em>ad nauseam</em> those disagreements. We are like mice on a spinning wheel. Debates between left and right, liberals and conservatives, centrists and socialists, institutionalists and activists recur. Round and round we go, without necessarily resolving very much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when we seem to agree, we disagree. The anti-communist liberal of the early 1960s and the illiberal progressive of the 2010s are very different creatures. Likewise the classic liberal free-market conservative differs sharply from the national-populist conservative or the illiberal social conservative. Neo-conservatives and libertarian conservatives clash bitterly over the wisdom of war as do anti-war leftists and national-security liberals. To a large extent politics is a function of judgment. It establishes lines for or against, pro and anti. Every judgment creates a distinction and each distinction sub- divides into ever-more minute distinctions. In fact it is division all the way down. Music is different. With each political faction and sub-faction armed with its own furious critical judgment, no one can tolerate sitting in the same seminar room with anyone else. Yet you can still find these squabbling individuals at a concert enjoying the same music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Immanuel Kant, philosophers have often argued that aesthetic preferences are a matter of taste. In other words, these preferences lack universal validity. To an extent, this is true. Whether you like the Beatles or Led Zeppelin (or neither) is a matter of taste. Listeners sometimes defend their tastes quite aggressively. As do cultural critics. At times both behave like political partisans. The recurring problem experienced by everyone is not judgment as such but rather tunnel-vision judgment. The faculty of judgment is the way we carve up the world analytically. We separate one part from another. However separation lends itself to fixations and monomanias.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fortunately though our judgments are qualified by our intuitions. No amount of critical music analysis for example can overcome the brain’s immediate intuitive recognition of ingenious chord progressions, diverting ways of getting to a tonal center, or mischievously seductive rhythmic patterns. Immediate judgments, whether they are musical or political, are also qualified by the judgment of time. As time passes the influence of fads and fashions dissipates. A tacit but ruthless sorting process takes place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of music, the residue left behind is a broadly consensual catalog of works of enduring value that has survived the greatest aesthetic test of all: Is a work still worth listening to after fifty years? The simple fact is that a remarkable number of records of the pop-rock golden age have passed this test. Compare that number with pop-rock artifacts from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Each successive decade has produced comparatively fewer works of lasting value, works that bear repeated listening over time and that transcend their own immediate era of creation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is it about golden-era works that gave them such staying power? Part of the answer is the generic power of music. Music taps into the synthetic part of the brain. Harmony, melody and rhythm in their different ways create the types of abstract unions of opposites that appeal deeply to the pattern-recognition right-hemisphere of the brain. Music unifies because it stimulates, in the right hemisphere, patterns that we find very satisfying. Whereas politics and criticism tend to be left-brained and analytical. They separate, divide and dissect. In politics we argue; in music we harmonize.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most interesting music embodies a paradox. It offers familiarity combined with strangeness. It draws us in with something we recognize as familiar. Then it takes us to surprising aural places. 1960s and ‘70s pop-rock excelled in doing this. It contained a lot of ingenious chord, melodic, and rhythmic patterns, brain teasers and ear-worms that made us want to listen to something again and again. The art of this was to take a surface layer of familiar sound elements and then twist and turn these in surprising ways. The key is to simultaneously fulfill and defy listener expectations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artists and composers use innumerable techniques to combine the familiar and the strange. Among these are modes, breaks and ambivalent tunings; the flattening, sharpening, sliding or bending of notes; counter melodies, rhythmic shifts, polyrhythms; distortion, dissonance and muting; combinations of static and moving lines; quirky phrasing and fills; shifts between chord tones and tension-inducing extensions; feedback and chordal note suspensions; chord inversions, phrase endings, swells, fades, tension notes, and octave jumps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The golden age of pop-rock offered an additional intriguing kind of synthesis. This was genre synthesis. It took a huge range of pre-existing popular genres and the occasional classical or archaic genre—and merged these. Imagine a multitude of liberal and conservative political genres being fused. Unimaginable? Well, yes, in the sense that politics is predominantly analytic not synthetic. Music is the opposite. It harbors a natural impulse to synthesize. This happened to a remarkable degree in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The original creative musical fusionism of the golden era drew on rock-n-roll, rockabilly, folk, blues, jazz, gospel, soul, funk, R&amp;B, Brill Building pop, and country genres. Diverse currents converged in singular visions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Epitomizing this were Bob Dylan’s amalgam of epic surrealism, sardonic folk, garage rock, lovelorn pop, Memphis and Chicago blues, psychedelic country and New Orleans’ brass band on <em>Blonde on Blonde</em> (1966) and the Beatles’ <em>White Album</em> (1968) with its amalgam of musique concrète, music hall, country pastiche, ska, parodic blues, orchestral lullaby, heavy metal, and Beach Boys styles. The incantation, stream-of-consciousness, jazz, chamber orchestration, blues and Celtic folk of Van Morrison’s <em>Astral Weeks</em> (1968) and the country-folk, epic drama, apocalyptic-folk, plaintive ballads and muscular rock of Neil Young’s <em>After the Gold Rush</em> (1972) display similar artful fusions. Led Zeppelin’s <em>Physical Graffiti</em> (1975) segued between brutal hard rock and delicate acoustic folk, blues swagger, metallic-gospel, pop, boogie, keyboard prog, cinematic orchestral epic, lilting country-pop and ribald funk-metal. What makes these works stand out is not just their stylistic breadth but the way that each stylistic allusion is melded into an instantly recognizable whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Creation appears in many forms. Brilliance can emerge from the ingenious application of musical techniques. Joni Mitchell’s use of unorthodox guitar tunings and her exploration of tonal possibilities on the album <em>Blue</em> (1971) and the Bacharach-David-Dionne Warwick combination’s use of complex chords and asymmetrical melodies for their ‘66-71 pop singles are prime examples of this. Other artists can be credited with the early development of a distinctive music genre. Ray Charles is a key figure in the evolution of soul music in the 1950s. Similarly the Maytals pioneered late-‘60s reggae and Marc Bolan ‘70s glam music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But something supersedes all of these. This is the inventive artist who assimilates multiple genres. What makes the ‘65-75 era exemplary is the repeated incidence of these uncanny syntheses— among them Elton John’s <em>Tumbleweed Connection</em> (1970), The Who’s <em>Who's Next</em> (1971), Genesis' <em>Foxtrot</em> (1972), David Bowie's <em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust</em> (1972), the Rolling Stones' <em>Exile on Main St.</em> (1972), and Bruce Springsteen's <em>Born to Run</em> (1975). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All creativity ebbs with the passage of time. That is true of both collective and individual creativity. Golden eras wane. So it was with the gilded pop-rock era. Typically, creative personalities are very productive. All the major figures of the golden era continued to produce music on a large scale. On occasions they would manage to reach the creative heights of their iconic period. However the mind is not indefinitely elastic. Repeated stretching ends in a loss of elasticity. That’s the Achilles heel of the creative personality. Greatness is fleeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the golden era had an unusually high percentage of gifted fusionists with their impeccable talent for unexpected genre combinations, each decade since has had their own tally of fusionist works. Among them The Clash’s punk-pop-soul-R&amp;B-ska-reggae- rockabilly-jazz laced <em>London Calling</em> (1979), Elvis Costello and the Attractions’ <em>Imperial Bedroom</em> (1982) blend of baroque pop, torch song and wall-of-sound, and Prince’s <em>Purple Rain</em>’s (1984) mix of rock, electronica, and R&amp;B. Later on there’s Suede’s 1994 glam-rock, baroque-pop, art-rock, cinematic, and orchestral <em>Dog Man Star</em> (1994) followed by the vast looping collage of alt-rock, wall-of-sound, grunge, orchestration, heavy metal and art rock on The Smashing Pumpkins’ <em>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</em> (1995), and Radiohead’s dense blend of electronica, sampling, alt-rock, atonality, cinematic ambience, jazz-funk-psyche-rock fusion and musique concrète on <em>OK Computer</em> (1997).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notably though, each decade since the golden era has produced proportionately fewer classic works. An aesthetic classic is a work that transcends its own time. A golden era produces a lot of such works. When they first appear they are transformative. Yet they prove durable. In contrast, with the passing decades pop-rock music has continued to proliferate genres, most with short-lived moments of intense popularity: baroque pop, mod, power pop, psychedelic pop, punk, reggae, new wave, art pop, heavy metal, heartland rock, blue eyed soul, electronica, hip-hop, ambient, disco, trip-hop, alt-country, alt-rock, industrial, indie-folk, dance pop, standards, Latin, Celtic, alt-rock, dream pop, Britpop, jangle pop, K-pop, garage, dance punk, and more. With new genres come new production styles which also tend to date badly. Few production styles transcend their own time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fusionism is open to a wide range of genre styles but it also has the musical challenge of integrating eclectic music forms into a compelling unity. The act of creation has to be able to make divergent genres converge. If the artists who do this successfully were simply eclectic in their behavior, then their work would be idiosyncratic. Albums would be little more than a random menu of an artist’s personal tastes rather than a synthetic unity. Artists who have a real talent for fusionism are rare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of politics is like a lot of second-tier and third-tier pop-rock music. It is ubiquitous in its time but also trapped by that time. In every decade the tenor of politics changes. Yet, like musical genres or production styles, the debates and divides of each decade are transient. To a large degree political ideas are over-determined by shifting psychological moods. Political actors adapt to this. They appear in public behind a wide variety of evanescent rhetorical masks. They adopt transient public personas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Past decades have seen many well-rehearsed mask styles including those of the patrician, Machiavellian, boss, patron, confessor, idealist, amiable dunce, avuncular helper, hyper-partisan, and so on. The most recent decade, the 2010s, saw a remarkable rise of personas based on types of personality disorder. These included narcissistic, paranoid, anti-social, a-social, magical-thinking, impulsive, histrionic, avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive types. The entire political spectrum from left to right was tainted by these bizarre personas. In step with this, the 2010s was the weakest decade ever of pop-rock classicism. The essential breadth of imagination evaporated from music and politics simultaneously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is interesting to observe the changing psychological styles of politics. Decennial forms of analysis (the ‘60s, the ‘90s, etc.) yield insights. Yet what is commonly missing from these analytic diagnoses is an understanding of the synthetic dimension of mind and society. In its seventy years of existence, pop-rock music has produced decennial innovations that the ear is analytically attuned to and responsive to (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively) along with a much smaller number of works and creators that transcend the powerful decennial demarcations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Culture critics and political partisans alike are drawn to decennial waves like moths to light. They find them irresistible. One day we have ‘60s-prog; next day ‘70s-punk is king. That’s how culture and politics work. The shifts occur rapidly. One day the Republican Party is dominated by Bush institutionalists; the next day by Trump populists. For years Clinton centrists controlled the Democratic Party; then mercurially it was Obama-era progressives. This is not new. Shakespeare’s history plays are full of such political swing-shifts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The styles of decennial politics are reminiscent of the decadal turn-over of pop-rock music genres. Genres have a pattern of rising rapidly to ubiquity and then quickly fading. The singer-songwriter in the 1970s; disco in the late ‘70s; grunge in the 1990s illustrate this. Genres don’t die. They enter a (now) vast musical pool that can be drawn on at will. Past genres offer semantic units that creators use as scaffolding for their works. Politics is similar. It operates with ubiquitous decadal styles that rise and fall. These styles are distinctive mixes of psychology, policy and performance just as music genres are distinctive mixes of harmony, melody and rhythm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Music genres tap our analytic faculties. ‘80s disco and new wave pop genres were distinctive compared with '70s blues rock or '60s chanteuse pop. Successive generations as they come of age have a desire to demarcate themselves from those who have come before. Just as sixties folk-rock fans parsed themselves from the cool jazz, rockabilly and rock-n-roll styles of the 1950s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the wheel of music turns so too does politics. Analytically distinctive mixes of personality, psychology, and performance rise and fall swiftly. They appear all-consuming until they abruptly disappear from sight. Occasionally though a figure with a synthetic rather than analytic style of politics will emerge. Winston Churchill, the genre-transcending liberal-conservative, is a brilliant example of this. Such personalities, however, are the exception not the rule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exceptions, though, are important. Analyzing and judging are key functions of the human mind. These are inescapable and necessary. However they are also inherently limited. A world filled with criticism and bereft of harmony is dystopian. In politics this dystopia is remarkably seductive. The incessant creation of political styles, like musical genres, draws us in. These styles though quickly run out of puff. Their ubiquity lacks durability. As with music, what ultimately matters is that, from time to time, we come across a small number of political figures whose instinctive classicism allows them to transcend decadal vortices and critical divisions. These are rare souls who are crafted for all seasons.</p>

<p><strong>Public libraries have seen better times</strong>. In many parts of the United States, they are no longer the center of intellectual and community life that they once were—or, at least, once aspired to be. It is surprising then, given the decline of the public library in general, that in the San Francisco Bay Area, one public library serves not only as an educational resource but also as a gestating archive, a living body of sorts, pulsating and breathing and energizing anew. In the case of the Oakland Public Library, this seemingly breathing, pulsating body continues to serve as a living reminder of the role the Black Arts Movement played and, in many ways, continues to play, in the Bay Area. In the postwar period and especially in more recent decades, the Library has become a nutritional conduit, connecting key elements of Oakland’s political and artistic past and continued struggles in our national and global present. Today, the Oakland Public Library serves to remind not only of the significant role that the Black Arts Movement has and continues to play, but also the way in which this movement was an early effort at decolonizing Western ideas of what constitutes revolutionary artistic practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Black Arts Movement—a movement whose name is often abbreviated with the succinctly impactful, three-letter onomatopoeic imperative “BAM”—began in 1967. BAM perhaps reached its most powerful form by 1980. Its association with the Civil Rights Movements, as well as its affiliation with the Black Panther Party and the Black Power campaigns, gave BAM in its earliest days, its focus on revolutionary cultural reconstruction. The Black Panther Party and BAM sometimes appear almost inseparable. As such, it may not be surprising to find that the Oakland Public Library is part of an ongoing effort to bring the artistry, the effort, the emancipatory struggle visualized and nurtured by the art, to contemporary efforts to end systemic racism and racial injustice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overshadowed to a great extent by San Francisco’s iconic status as a center of social transformation in the 1960s, Oakland was nevertheless a center for cultural revolution. The East Bay, in general, never seems to get the recognition it deserves as an epicenter of artistry, something that films like <em>Black Panther</em> (2018) attempt to address. But it is Oakland Public Library that is at the vanguard of this effort to honor BAM as an underappreciated avant- garde art movement. Dorothy Lazard’s entry on the Library’s website offers up some of the key dimensions of BAM as manifested in the Bay Area broadly—and, more specifically, in Oakland and Berkeley. Lazard notes the way in which BAM echoed some of the celebrations of Black culture associated with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. Yet Oakland in the 1960s proved to be fertile territory not only for a similar embrace of the arts in the name of solidarity, but also for presenting a superstructural message, an ideological imperative, to think about Black culture and the Black body differently. Lazard makes clear that with its emergence in 1967, BAM helped fuel these energies into a future-oriented project: “As the Black Arts Movement grew, galleries and cultural centers sprouted all over the East Bay in storefronts, church basements, and private homes. African Americans were hungry for representation, and African American artists took it upon themselves to make art that expressed what they were feeling politically and personally.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yet in the voluminous literature on the (European and North American) avant-garde, there is rather little, comparatively speaking, about the Black Arts Movement. Part of this absence is the term itself: avant-garde. The idea of an artistic avant-garde was articulated in 1825 in a text most often attributed to the French Utopian Socialist Henri de Saint-Simon. Saint-Simon saw in the role of the artist an important figure for transforming the existing social order, even as he—and more specifically, associated members of the nineteenth century Utopian Socialist movement—engaged in colonizing practices of their own—for example, in Algiers. Here is a brief excerpt from the text attributed to Saint-Simon, showcasing what he believed should be the newly significant role for the arts in the realm of social and cultural change:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">It is we artists who will serve as your vanguard; the power of the arts is indeed most immediate and the quickest. We possess arms of all kinds: when we want to spread new ideas among men, we inscribe them upon marble or upon a canvas; we popularize them through poetry and through song; we employ by turns the lyre and the flute, the ode and the song, the story and the novel; the dramatic stage is spread out before us, and it is there that we exert a galvanizing and triumphant influence.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">The immediacy of the arts, its power as “the most immediate and the quickest” form of spreading, popularizing, influencing is still crucial for us today. How else do we explain the continued allure of aesthetic experiences as well as the deleterious effects of social media forms, from Twitter to TikTok, with their powerful visuals, often full of detailed information but also very short on facts?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recognizing, perhaps even celebrating, the continued power of avant-garde criticality, we cannot and should not ignore the ways in which certain Utopian Socialist ideas, and European Enlightenment ones as well, became so readily aligned with colonialist and racist ideologies. Yet there is something both critical and communal in Saint-Simon’s concept of the avant-garde which has great use today, still, in thinking through what decolonizing the European avant- garde might mean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Amiri Baraka’s 1964 poem “Black Dada Nihilismus” represents the kind of simultaneous examination and disruption of European avant-garde traditions, a simultaneous examination and disruption that is evident in much of the work of the Black Arts Movement. Born Everett LeRoy (LeRoi) Jones in 1934 in New Jersey, Baraka changed his name in 1967 to Imamu Amiri Baraka (“spiritual leader, blessed prince”) in response, according to some, to the murder of Malcolm X in 1965. Baraka would later drop “Imamu” from his name. His iconic poem, “Black Dada Nihilismus,” is ideally played from the 1964 recording the poet made with the New York Art Quartet, an all-Black jazz group. But in written form, the poem showcases the ongoing tensions between conceptions of the “avant-garde” as an artistic and revolutionary concept and the concomitant, ongoing Western exploitation that allowed for both colonialism and system racism: As Daniel Won-Gu Kim suggests, Baraka’s language—not only in his poem, “Black Dada Nihilismus,” but in others of his works as well—is far from radical when situated in the tradition of the European avant-garde in general, movements like Dada (1916-1923) in particular. Baraka’s words provoke, they shock, they challenge, they are violent—but they also show ineffectiveness of language, of art, alone. Baraka was jailed for poems like “Black Dada Nihilismus,” poems that were deemed incendiary. This imprisonment seems today, but perhaps not for Baraka at the time, ironic: An imperative for silence in spite of the history of slavery and racial injustice to which he was responding and to which he was trying to bring broader public attention. Baraka was successful in his provocations in other ways as well; Won-Gu Kim suggests that Baraka found in Dada key tools for, “destroying the degraded language logic of bourgeois Western rationality.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The troubling bind in Baraka’s poem “Black Dada Nihilismus” of using language, using art, even if they are not weapons in the sense of a military avant-garde, finds expression in the work of the Black Arts Movement broadly, and in BAM’s Bay Area manifestations more specifically. Here BAM reminds us that a revolutionary avant- garde might need to be rethought as a “vanguard.” The etymology is important here, though, for even as writers and scholars try to disassociate BAM from a Western-centric, colonial idea of an artistic avant-garde, the term “vanguard” still alludes to the same structures, the same system, the same language—in this case, French—that justified colonial ideas of exploitation, theft, rape, murder under the disgustingly hypocritical guise to “civilize.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were a great number of artists affiliated with BAM and working in Oakland, Berkeley, and the Bay Area in general. The writers Ishmael Reed, Marvin X, J. California Cooper, and Reginald Lockett, offered engaging, inspired words. The Bay Area Black Artists (BABA) Collective became a prominent force. Creatives such as cartoonist Marie Turner, mixed-media artist Maria Johnson, musician John Handy, as well as many others—James Lawrence, Carol Ward Allen, Casper Banjo—all exhibited or performed. Bay Area college factory, too, brought revolutionary visibility to the issue of racial justice and in hopes of challenging systemic racism—Claude Clark at Merritt College, among them. Ted Potiflet, a graduate of my own institution—then known as California College of Arts and Crafts—became a notable printmaker and photographer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exhibition venues and opportunities for community gathering flourished in the Bay Area as a result of the influence of the Black Panther Party and the Black Arts Movement. Notable in the East Bay were the Rainbow Sign on Grove Street in Berkeley, Samuel’s Gallery—owned by Samuel Fredericks—in Oakland’s Jack London Village, and the Ebony Museum of Art owned by Aissatoui A.Vernita in West Oakland and which, for a time, had a second space also in Jack London. The Rainbow Sign was a particular standout, hosting an impressive array of performers and artists as part of the cultural center’s programming: the singer Nina Simone, the writers Maya Angelous and James Baldwin, and the sculptor Elizabeth Carlett all visited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notable among this impressive list of East Bay figures is Emory Douglas, now 79 years old, a member of the Black Panther Party beginning in 1967 and its original Minister of Culture. Douglas’s artistic influence can be seen in its historical context in the ongoing Black Power exhibition in the Gallery of California History at the Oakland Museum of California as well as in recent work, including in the posters for Spike Lee’s 2020 film <em>Da 5 Bloods</em>, and in appearances at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, an institution which only recently acquired a collection of some 30 issues of the Black Panther newsletter, dating 1969-1970, many of which feature Douglas’s now iconographic work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The vanguard, if not also avant-garde, work of BAM is undoubtedly the reason that contemporary cultural institutions turn to the Bay Area, and to the East Bay and to Oakland in particular, to showcase the continued cultural but also social and political influence of the Black Panther Party and the 20th century efforts at addressing, ideally eliminated, systemic racism and racial injustice. Even if these goals at times seem far from achieved, a variety of venues and associations in the Bay Area—the Eastside Arts Alliance, the Black Cultural Zone, the Malongo Casquelourd Center for the Arts, and the Art of Living Black exhibitions—all show BAM’s continued influence. Oakland Public Library’s ongoing commitment to documenting not only BAM’s history but also its continued Bay Area presence is itself part of this vibrant landscape— a living, breathing monument, an enduring and active reminder of what decolonizing the “avant-garde” can look like.</p>

Sometimes it would be the way that somebody would stare at us in the street, or the tone of voice that a salesclerk would use when talking to him. We knew that it was because we looked different from most people in Santiago, Chile. As descendants of Japanese immigrants, we stood out in a country where Asians were rare. My mother had taught us to ignore the stares, the way that kids would call names behind our backs.

<p class=""unindented""><strong>Growing up in the 1960s</strong> in Santiago, Chile I witnessed among my parents and maternal grandfather different expressions of their diasporic selves created by the conditions of their migration. Both of my Japanese grandfathers, natives of the city of Hiroshima, dreamed of Japan and planned to return with their families at the end of World War II. But on August 6, 1945, the bombing of Hiroshima by the US destroyed their ancestral home and killed all their relatives, ending their dreams of going back to the homeland. In the postwar era they became exiles in Latin America. My parents, who were teenagers, had to reconcile with the notion that Chile, a country in which they felt unwelcome, was their home. They dealt differently with the stresses created by the racist attitudes of a country that had little experience with Japanese people, and with their own sense of estrangement and sense of belonging. My father never felt comfortable in Chile, because he grew up in Lima, Peru in one of the largest Japanese immigrant communities in South America. On the other hand, for my mother, Chile was the only country she knew, and she was willing to adapt to Chile. My maternal grandfather, like my father, expressed nostalgia for Japan and disillusionment over his broken dreams.</p>

Through my family's experiences I was able to observe the creation of two different diasporic selves: my father’s uniexperiences growing up in Peru, a country with the earliest migration from Japan, and at one point with the largest population of Japanese in Latin America, and my mother’s and grandfather’s experiences in Chile, a country with the smallest number of Japanese migrants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1899 Peru was the first country in Latin America to receive Japanese migrants to work on the cotton plantations. Life in the plantations was hard and after a few years, most Japanese had moved to the cities. By the 1930s the Japanese migrants lived primarily in cities and were part of an affluent middle class, mostly as the owners of shops. They created an insular community where they maintained their language and culture with their own schools, newspapers, and clubs. During World War II this insularity worked against them because they became the scapegoat of many of the country’s social and economic problems. Japanese homes and businesses were the target of violent attacks. This culminated with the Peruvian government, following the US policies, declared all people of Japanese descent to be enemies of the state, confiscated their properties and deported over 2,000 Japanese Peruvians to camps in the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, Chile has one of the smallest populations of Japanese descendants in Latin America. The first arrived in 1903 to work in the mines. The lack of opportunities for Japanese immigrants, combined with a strong anti-immigrant and anti-Asian bias which officially banned migration from Asia in 1925, discouraged Japanese migration to Chile. Japanese settlers in Chile never surpassed 900 between 1910 and 1940. Most were men who primarily married Chilean women because they were unable to bring their wives or brides to Chile. After World War II there has been a slight increase of migration to Chile, but it continues to be one of the Latin American countries with the smallest Asian population.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><em>Creating the Artwork</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scattered Seeds of the Cotton Bolls consists of 75 handmade paper flowers hanging on barbed wire from the ceiling occupying a space of 10x20x10 feet (Figure 1). I chose flowers for two reasons: to symbolize cotton bolls, as the first migration of Japanese to Latin America was to work in the cotton plantations in Peru, and to pay a tribute to my Japanese ancestors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The creation of the flowers entailed a series of techniques and manufacturing stages during which I recalled memories, reflected, and symbolically healed past emotional wounds. The first stage was the creation of the papers used for the flowers. I chose to handmake the papers, not only because it is a traditional Japanese craft but also because I associated handmade papers with my maternal grandfather, who as a merchant exported silks and papers from Japan to Chile. As a child, I used to play with the boxes of Japanese mulberry paper napkins that my grandfather had imported from Japan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote""><em>I used to see my maternal grandfather crying on April 29, the day commemorating the birth of Hirohito, emperor of Japan (1927-1988). Every year, he would get together with his only two Japanese friends at his house and spend the evening singing traditional songs and crying. He rarely drank alcohol, but on this occasion, he would drink sake and his cheeks would get red and his eyes glassy. As a child I didn’t fully understand my grandfather’s sorrow. But I sensed it was associated with what I perceived as our differences and with the place that brought nostalgia to both my grandfather and my father. A place that I didn’t know but resented because I knew that I didn’t belong to it.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Overcome with a desire to assuage these painful memories, I chose two types of fiber to symbolically unite the rift that my Japanese grandparents’ generation felt regarding Peru and Chile and the possibilities for healing when seen from the perspective of my own hybrid ancestry as the descendant of Japanese grandfathers and Spanish grandmothers. I mixed mulberry, a fiber used for making <em>kozo</em>, a Japanese paper known for its strength, to represent the Japanese migrants in Latin America, and <em>yerba buena</em>, an herb used in Latin America for soothing pain. Grinding and mixing both fibers in a vat of water, seeing the whitish slender mulberry fibers and the dark green small smudges of the yerba buena first float separately in the water, later blending as I lifted them using a bamboo screen while gently shaking them, I experienced a sense of unity and comfort. I then wove together the different fibers, creating a fine layer of pulp that later I pressed, creating a finished sheet of textured paper.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Using the paper lithograph method, I printed on each of the petals flower images depicting the themes of Japanese migration to Peru, work on the plantations, World War II and the incarceration of Japanese Peruvians in camps in Crystal City, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. I embroidered each petal using <em>Sachiko</em>, a traditional Japanese mending technique, and European embroidery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The act of embroidering created an interactive and dynamic system in which the stitching created a movement forward to new memories, emotions, and reflections and in turn these activated each other bringing more memories, emotions, and reflections. As I was invaded by memories and feelings, I felt a desire to soothe, symbolically, these emotions by changing the pattern of the stitching. For example, during the embroidery of the petals of one of the flowers representing my father’s life in Lima, Peru, prior to his forced migration to Chile to escape deportation to the United States, I adjusted the pattern of the stitching to experience a form of touching or caressing the streets where my father used to walk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I contemplated the printed image of the street where he lived. I stitched parallel lines of mending Sachiko embroidering covering the streets where he had walked over to mend his suffering. As I pierced the paper with the needle, I felt that I was simultaneously following my memories while projecting my feelings of compassion towards my father (figure 2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote""><em>I recalled his nostalgia for Lima, a city that had been so hostile to my dad. He missed, however, a different Lima, and a different life. He used to recall the promise made by his father that he would attend the Imperial University of Tokyo, like his own father has done, but the bombing of Hiroshima had ended his dreams. I relived his sadness, his inability of blending in, or accepting life in Chile where he was a stranger.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I had a similar emotional experience while creating the flowers depicting the bombing of Hiroshima, which made me reflect on the erasure of my Japanese past. To depict the bombing, I made image transfers using red and black etching ink, of photos of the bomb exploding, maps of the trajectory of the US bombs destined for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and print photos of the only building standing in Hiroshima after the bombing. I stitched the paper with French knots using red threads to mark the deaths and white to portray the ashes of the bombing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As with the petals of flowers I made to represent my father’s life in Lima, I expressed my feelings of compassion and sorrow for the deaths in my family by stitching white lines in Sashiko that run par- allel to the trajectory of the planes carrying the bombs to be dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki (figure 3).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2708,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Similarly, in the creation of <em>Family Memories of Forced Migration</em>, a sculpture made of paper which summarizes my family’s migration to Latin America, I used stitching to express my feelings of sorrow as well as a desire for healing. Two petals show the poster used in Japan to promote migration to Latin America, another the cotton plantation fields where many Japanese migrants worked. Two more petals show the bombing of Hiroshima, and the last 3 petals show my family. I expressed my sorrow in the poster that called for Japanese to leave the country by surrounding the main figure with red stitches symbolizing the pain and suffering that many migrants experienced, and I covered the map of South America with French knots in yellow symbolizing the xenophobia that they experienced. I surrounded my parents’ faces with blue and red mending stitches, whereas for the petal showing my sister and mother and I holding hands at the beach, I surrounded us with yellow French knots emphasizing our unity and my mother’s strength in helping us deal with racism (figure 4).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the time I worked on these artworks I was affected like the rest of us by the Covid-19 pandemic. I found that the repetitive activities of crafting the papers, embroidering them, and printing them gave me a sense of dwelling in this world that makes our stay so fragile, and how so often our sense of confidence in a secure future is illusory.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Artmaking served as the conduit for tracing memories and at the same time enacting symbolic moments of empathy, compassion, and healing. In the process of tracing these memories through the act of creating, I captured the experience of continuous becoming.</p>

2716,"A History of the History of Empire, IV","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>IN AD 330 CONSTANTINOPLE</strong>, rising at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, was inaugurated as the New Rome. In 615 Jerusalem was lost to the army of Chosroes II, the Great King of Sassanid Persia. After slaughtering almost all of the Christians and burning down the church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Persians carried away the True Cross as a trophy for their shah. Within a decade, the Persians and their “barbarian” allies, the Avars, were besieging the City itself. It was the climax of what J. M. Roberts calls “the last world war of antiquity,” resuming as it did a thousand-year-old clash of civilizations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Led by the soldier-emperor Heraclius, the Byzantines thrust back the invaders on land and sea, sending the Great King into a flight that ended at his capital Ctesiphon. Deserted by his disillusioned troops, Chosroes was deposed by his son Kavahd, who had him shot slowly to death with arrows. In the peace talks that followed, Heraclius recovered the True Cross, which was transported to Byzantium and stood upright on the high altar of Santa Sophia in a triumphant mass. After this miraculous history, the New Romans had every reason to believe that Constantinople had become even more a heavenly city, in fact, a type of New Jerusalem, inevitably eclipsing the significance, for them, of the original. In any case it was lost, in 635, to the caliph Omar, whose conquests reversed all that Byzantium had regained in the Middle East and enlarged an Islamic dominion which eventually extended in the West to Iberia. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the next five and a half centuries, while it remained under Muslim authority, the Latin West continued, albeit in a detached way, to regard old Jerusalem—King David’s city—as the center of the world, where in due course the Messiah would reappear, this time, ideally, in gilded armor and riding a white charger. Meanwhile, Omar had decreed a policy of toleration toward his Jewish and Christian subjects, which, continued over the centuries by his successors, was more than their sects accorded one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the 8th and early 9th centuries the emperor Charlemagne and the Abbasid caliph Haroun al-Raschid (of Arabian Nights fame) maintained a cordial long-distance friendship founded, says Gibbon, on “a similar supremacy of genius and power.” It was kept up by the regular exchange of gifts and embassies. Al-Raschid possessing the larger and more opulent domain, his gifts were grander, including a water clock, an elephant, and the keys to the Holy Sepulcher. The Frankish protectorate in Jerusalem implied by Raschid’s bequest led to benefactions by Charlemagne (a hospital, a library) and cultural exchanges between the Christian establishment in Jerusalem and the West, eventually giving rise to the legend that Charlemagne had actually reigned in Palestine as the first crusader.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The Fatimid age of tolerance, at its height during the reign of al’Aziz, the great builder of Cairo, did not survive the caprices of his son Ali Mansur al-Hakim, raised to the throne at the age of eleven. A “frantic youth” (Gibbon), whose mother was a Russian Christian, Hakim did not mellow with age. “His reign was marked with monstrous atrocities,” Philip Hitti details.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">He killed several of his vizirs, demolished a number of Christian churches including that of the Holy Selpulchre (1009), forced Christians and Jews to wear black robes, ride only on donkeys and display when in baths a cross dangling from their necks if Christians, and a sort of yoke with bells, if Jews.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">In Egypt, where men and women had always mixed freely, none of Hakim’s innovations aroused such turbulent opposition as the strict confinement of women: according to Gibbon, “the restraint excited the clamours of both sexes; their clamours provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the flames, and the guard and citizens were engaged many days in a bloody conflict.” Amidst such upheavals, the destruction of the churches of the Holy Sepulcher, built five centuries before by Justinian, horrified Europe’s Christians, and it must be said, Hakim’s carnage was thorough-going. Not only were the churches torn down to their foundations, the rocky cavern itself was broken up with “much profane labor.” Altogether, Hakim’s regime was a woefully prophetic one, anticipating the radical iconoclasm of the Arab Wahhabi in the 18th century, the stigmas of the Nazis in the 20th, and the prudery of the Taliban in the 21st. “Finally,” Hitti winds up the astonishing tale, “this enigmatic, blue-eyed caliph, following the extremer development of Ismailite doctrine, declared himself the incarnation of the Deity”; and was embraced as such by a newly organized cult, the Druze. Secular history records that Hakim was killed by assassins recruited by his sister, who wished to protect the succession of her son to the caliphate. The Druze, however, believe that he simply disappeared, closing forever the door of mercy behind him, and will reappear at the end of days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather than mounting an expedition against Hakim (again following Gibbon’s account), the West turned its indignation against the Jews in their midst, whom a conspiracy theory blamed for his actions, and those who escaped burning were banished. Hakim’s earthly successors restored the ancient Fatimid tolerance. The sepulcher was rebuilt, the Easter miracle of fire (a “pious fraud,” Gibbon sneers) promptly resumed, and the pilgrims returned in numbers. But the Fatimids were soon replaced as Palestine’s overlords by the Seljuk Turks. Having overthrown the Abbasids whom they had formerly served as mercenaries, the Seljuks were now contending with the Egyptians for mastery of the Middle East; and they were neither as lenient as Baghdad or as tolerant as Cairo had been to their dhimmi subjects. Gibbon once more:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted the Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect; the patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement and cast into a dungeon to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock...</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">These outrages were no more than Hakim’s. But this time Europe would show a “more irascible temper”: It appeared that “a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling; and the sensation was vibrated to the heart of Europe.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beset by Turkish invaders in Asia Minor, disconcerted to find vagabond Normans occupying ancient Byzantine territories in Apulia and Sicily, besieged in Constantinople itself by needy aristocrats whose Anatolian estates had been lost to the Turks, the emperor Alexius I Comnenus established a détente with the Latin church. Might the Great Schism between Orthodoxy and Catholicism, which had arisen as recently as 1054, be repaired? In a fateful hour, Alexius authorized an appeal for military assistance to be delivered by his spokesmen at a church council at Piacenza, with the pope, Urban II, presiding. At a subsequent council in Clermont, in central France, Urban responded with his famous call for a crusade, promising heavenly grace to the cross-bearers (thus, “crusaders”) who went to the rescue of their oppressed brethren and achieved the restoration of the Holy Sepulcher: “Rid the sanctuary of God of the unbelievers, expel the thieves and lead back the faithful,” Urban exhorted—or at least he did in the eloquent version attributed to him by William of Malmesbury. “No love of native heath should delay you, for in one sense the whole world is exile for a Christian, and in another the whole world is his country: so exile is our fatherland, our fatherland exile.” Here was the rationale for a thousand years of European adventuring abroad, without ever losing sight of heaven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Significantly, Urban issued his call not from Rome, which was inconveniently occupied by an antipope, Guibert of Ravenna, but from a conclave in his native France. In terms of soldierly manpower the Crusades would be a largely Frankish affair, invigorated by Norman bravura, but also manipulated along the way by Venetian cupidity (historically, the Serene Republic was the cultural offspring and nominal vassal of the Empire, but an ungrateful one).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the chapter on the Crusades in his Short History of the World (1922), H. G. Wells presents its tragicomic opening, the so-called People’s Crusade, as perhaps the first truly democratic movement in European history. At the inception Urban saw a crusade as a means of diverting Europe’s “superabundant fighting energy,” from selfish “private” wars into a unifying mission based on a universal truce, “God’s peace.” If successful, it would compel the gratitude of Eastern Orthodoxy and, ideally, its theological submission to Rome. Peter the Hermit—not a recluse, but an itinerant fanatic who had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem—added fervor to these cool calculations with harangues that stirred the barefoot multitude in northern France and Germany.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Such a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a single idea as now occurred, was a new thing in the history of our race,” Wells writes. “There is nothing to parallel it in the previous history of the Roman Empire or of India or China,” although such a collective feeling had been aroused on a smaller scale by the Hebrew prophets, Mani, and Muhammad. “The preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common people in European history. It may be too much to call it the birth of modern democracy, but certainly at that time democracy stirred.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, the People’s Crusade would materialize in “crowds rather than armies,” would blunder and murder along the way, and would end “very pitifully and lamentably.” As many as 40,000 men, women, and children followed their uncouth shepherd, as they marauded their way to Hungary. There, exasperated at being mistaken for pagans and evilly treated, the recently Christianized Magyars had massacred two earlier waves of crusaders, and now reduced Peter’s numbers. At last, a remnant reached Constantinople, where it joined the flock led by Walter the Penniless. The emperor Alexius, who had anticipated a foreign legion and got, in the first instance, a rabble, was aghast. In August 1096, “complaints were already pouring in of robberies, rapes and lootings.” Unimpressed at a meeting with the Hermit, Alexius had the luckless multitude ferried across the Bosphorus to fend for themselves. At length fearful about where his followers’ zeal might lead them, Peter returned to the City, no doubt to plead for protection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As related by John Julius Norwich, his leaderless followers continued to antagonize the local Orthodox Greeks with their crass behavior, “killing, raping and occasionally torturing” their fellow Christians, but probably not roasting their babes on spits, as rumor told. On October 21, they marched straight into an ambush, retreating in a panicky flight to their camp, pursued all the way by the Turks. Norwich:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">A few lucky ones managed to take refuge in an old castle on the seashore, where they barricaded themselves in and somehow survived, as did a number of young girls and boys whom the Turks appropriated for their own purposes. The rest were slaughtered. The People’s Crusade was over.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The crusade of the princes was meanwhile massing its forces, possibly 150,000 strong by the time they were assembled by their feudal lords outside the gates of the City and ceremoniously greeted by Alexius. Among these characters destined to figure prominently, if not always gloriously, in the history of Byzantium and the Crusades were Geoffrey of Bouillon, Baldwin of Flanders, and, most vividly of all, Bohemond, the younger son of the Norman baron, Robert Guiscard.</p>

<p class=""indented"">On the Byzantine side, the story is told by the emperor’s daughter, Anna Comnena, whose eulogistic history of her father’s reign, the Alexiad, is a unique document in the annals of empire; only completed on her death-bed in 1153, it has been claimed to be the first major work of history written by a woman. Gibbon accuses Comnena of having an over-elaborate style that “betrays in every page the vanity of a female author,” which is not only ungallant but unworthy. The princess was justifiably proud of the superb education she had received, mostly at her own insistence, as well as the extent of her researches; and it is true her style might strike a modern reader as excessively rhetorical, but it was also equal to diplomatic combinazione: battles at sea, riots in the capital, the insatiable ambition, ferocity, and blond-beast good looks of the Guiscards of Apulia. The Alexiad ranges far beyond the Blachernae Palace and its intrigues to Comnena’s father’s interminable campaigns, conveying a sense of plebeian discontent and far off shadowy figures: Turks, heretical Bogomils, restless territorial Normans, always with designs on the heavenly city. In the emergent West of the 11th and 12th centuries, and especially in Byzantium, its most civilized part, there was nothing but reversals of fortune.</p>

<p>In spring 1097, now leading a disciplined and well prepared army, the princes crossed the Bosphorus into Asia. Their line of march took them past the ghastly sight of the people’s whitened bones piled in heaps and left to the elements. Fortune favored the bold. Following the approximate route Alexander had taken into Syria 1400 years before, and Napoleon would partially retrace 800 years later, the crusaders took Edessa and Nicaea, the provincial capital of what the Seljuks called “al-Rum” (meaning Rome and pronounced “room”), and devastated the Turks in a pitched battle near Dorylaeum in deeper Anatolia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This victorious march,” writes Hitti, “restored to Alexius, who had exacted from almost all the Crusading leaders an oath of feudal allegiance, the western half of the peninsula and helped to delay the Turkish invasion of Europe for a century and half.” There followed the campaigns under the Normans Bohemond, Baldwin, and Tancred, and Raymond of Toulouse, in which the first Latin baronies in the Middle East were established—the months-long siege and occupation of Antioch, where Bohemond would proclaim himself prince, followed by entrance into Palestine and arrival at Jerusalem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hitti continues: “Hoping the walls would fall as those of Jericho had done, the Crusaders first marched barefoot around the city, blowing their horns. A month’s siege proved more effective.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the gates, the crusaders made the holy city a charnel house: all the Muslims they could find were slaughtered and the Jews were burned alive in their synagogue. The chronicles tell of streets coursing with blood in which the Christian soldiers splashed as they rode. “At nightfall, ‘sobbing for excess of joy,’ the crusaders came to the Sepulchre from their treading of the winepress, and put their blood-stained hands together in prayer. So, on that day of July, the First Crusade came to an end.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">Ruled initially by Geoffrey and then Baldwin, in its various forms Jerusalem would be the most enduring of the Crusader states, lasting some 200 years, and claiming at its peak approximately the territory of present-day Israel, while hugging the coastline all the way to Damascus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Contrary to the expectations of many, the First Crusade turned out to be a resounding, if undeserved, success,” John Julius Norwich summarizes. The early 12th century proved to be an excellent time for a European invasion of the Middle East. The possession of Syria and Palestine was being contested by the Shiite Fatimid caliphate in Egypt and the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, both powers on the wane. Their proxy wars were fought over the heads of an immemorial peasantry that occasionally indulged a mutinous spirit (there were the usual plagues and famines). As intruders and transient overlords the red-haired barbarians were just another nuisance, perhaps even a diversion. The ancient empires were slow-breathing, long-lived entities; the Crusader kingdoms waxed and waned in mere decades, becoming a byword for transience. A second Crusade, in which German knights were prominent, was mounted in 1147. It culminated in a failed siege of Damascus in 1149.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stalemate was theatrically broken in the 1160s by the Kurdish general, Salah-ah-Din, known to the West as Saladin, who burst upon the scene as the young conqueror of the enervated Fatimids—their dynasty died out in a series of boy caliphs, some as young as four and five—and as the romantic antagonist of the Crusaders. His army men tore down the golden cross on the Dome Rock, on October 22, 1187, eight decades after the Christians had taken Aqsa Mosque at a cost of 70,000 Muslim lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To this enormity the West replied with a unified front led by Frederick Barbarossa, the emperor of Germany (who unluckily drowned in a river in Cilicia on his way to the Holy Land), Richard the Lion-Heart, the Norman king of England, and Philip Augustus, the king of France. The Third Crusade, although it accomplished not much more, became and remains the matter of romance and legend. The heyday of chivalry was succeeded by a triumph of venality. A Fourth Crusade, mounted by the usual French princes in 1203, and destined for Palestine, was diverted with suspicious ease by the Venetians, led by the 90-year-old blind doge, Dandalo, into meddling in Byzantium’s usual dynastic intrigues—feuding brothers, scheming widows, mob scenes, blinded young princes—finally using the excuse of a riot in 1204 to occupy and ransack the City, defile Santa Sophia, the greatest church in Christendom, and install as emperor a crude Latin prince, Baldwin I, who, adorned in the imperial regalia, ascended the throne after an orgy of desecration, destruction, and mass rape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Children’s Crusade of 1212 was a pathetic affair, led in France by a youthful shepherd, Stephen of Cloyes, and in Germany by another youth, Nicholas of Cologne; their followers, possibly including deluded adults as well as boys, expected the sea would part for them when the time came. The masses paused, respectively, in Genoa and Marseille before their destruction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Stephen’s army was kidnapped by slave-traders and sold into Egypt; while Nicholas’s expedition left nothing behind it but an after- echo in the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No doubt, the slave-markets of the East, extending all the way to Baghdad, were capacious enough to swallow up without a trace both boyish armies. Pope Innocent, nursing the dream of a universal empire under the tutelage of a universal church, obliviously moralized, “the very children put us to shame; while we sleep they go forth gladly to conquer the Holy Land.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Crusades of a sort continued to be proclaimed, and even to be mounted, in the East for another two centuries; but their great age had passed. After some desultory back-and-forth, Jerusalem was restored to Muslim rule in the mid-13th century, where it remained for more than 600 years. Their haunted castles were the last remnant of the Crusader kingdoms. Western Europe’s Age of Empire waited upon time and tide.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">The last minute text read: “Looking forward to our meeting.” I was racing to the World Art Day celebrations at Gloria Delson Contemporary Arts Gallery Downtown after a morning at the TCM Fest in Hollywood and avant-garde theater in the afternoon at CalArts in Santa Clarita. A few days prior to April 15th, a friend told me there’d be a Turkish painter-writer-political rebel I had to meet, but I hardly expected an interview to materialize just like that. After notetaking compulsively during the Art Day speeches, I had a baklava and another glass of wine, caught up with some people I knew and a few I didn’t, and was introduced to the Turk. “Meet Bedri.” His handshake was firm, his smile embracing, his head of wild curls unmistakable. We quickly arranged a time to meet the next day before I carried onward to a party in Silver Lake.<br>
<br>
The next evening I arrived back at GDCA, on Spring Street just past Seventh, greeted by Portia, the gallery’s resident pooch—a big black lab—and Bedri, who looked studious in crisp jeans and a pullover. The interview commenced right away; the prospect of speaking with a Berkeley-based publication must have set off strong recollections in the man. After completing an MBA at the Sorbonne in 1980, Bedri enrolled at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland; his first studio in the US—after the facilities at CCA—was at 800 Pine Street in West Oakland. “In those days,” Baykam laughed recalling the milieu, “well, let’s just say the ladies weren’t having afternoon tea in the street.” Regardless of its distractions, Baykam considers his time in that once rough-and-tumble part of town to have  been indispensably formative, characteristic of his unflappable sense of purpose.<br>
<br>
Since the Gold Rush, the Bay Area has been a multicultural bastion, even if its provincial elites weren’t always ready to embrace its products.    Baykam’s seminal San Francisco Manifesto, penned at Caffè Strada in Berkeley, took a resolute stand for all non-Western artists’ right to self-determination, and was distributed by the 27-year-old himself and his cadre outside SFMoMA in protest of its obdurate Eurocentricity.<br>
<br>
From his first solo show in Bern and Geneva at the age of six as an artworld Wunderkind—son of a Turkish politician—to his tenure as a New-Expressionist par excellence and champion of a Democratic Türkiye, Baykam recounts his life as a self-styled political-artistic “guerilla” in the velvet halls of high art who’s gone from provocateur to president of the International Association of Art (or IAA, an official UNESCO partner) and back with a prodigious dose of showmanship and no shortage of no-nonsense wit. His career is a curious one—in one sense for its multifaceted dynamism and in another for the relative lack of attention he’s garnered in the U.S. compared to some of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>
Downtown L.A. was relatively quiet on that mild night after our conversation. I walked back to the subway under the amber streetlamps quite satisfied with the happenstance way art, personality, and history sometimes coincide. This interview was edited for length and clarity.<br><br>
<em>Special thanks to Jonathan Jerald for the introduction. Thanks also to Baykam's assistant Öykü Eras for furnishing biographical details and her assistance throughout the process.</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bedri Baykam (b. Ankara, 1957) is one of Türkiye's most internationally renowned artists and intellectuals. The son of Dr. Suphi Baykam, a politician, and Mutahhar Baykam, an engineer-architect, he was a prodigy who has had international exhibitions since the age of six in many cities including Bern, Geneva, New York, Washington, Paris, London, Rome, Munich, Frankfurt, Stockholm, San Francisco, Monaco, Cannes, Berlin, and Los Angeles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He studied at the Sorbonne University in Paris from 1975 to 1980. He also studied drama in L'Actorat, Paris. He lived in California from 1980-1987, studying painting and filmmaking at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC, now CCA) in Oakland. He returned to Türkiye in 1987 and has remained in İstanbul ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baykam has had 143 one-man-shows in various countries in addition to participating in numerous group shows. His works have been shown in museums and institutes such as Berlin Akademie der Künste, Barcelona Picasso Museum, Paris Roland-Garros Museum, Pinacothèque de Paris, Stedelijk Schiedam Museum in Holland, Museum der Moderne Salzburg, Osthaus Museum Hagen, Künstlerhaus Bethanien Berlin, Bahrain National Museum, Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, National Academy of Arts of Ukraine and in Biennales such as Cairo, Venice, İstanbul and Buenos Aires; his work has also been displayed in galleries worldwide, including Daniel Templon (Paris), Stephen Wirtz (San Francisco), Yahşi Baraz (İstanbul), The Proposition (New York), Gallery Siyah Beyaz (Ankara), E.M. Donahue (New York), Galerie Kuchling (Berlin), Lavignes-Bastille (Paris), Galerie Pages (Geneva), Opera Gallery (London), Gloria Delson Contemporary Arts (Los Angeles). </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baykam is one of the pioneers of New-Expressionism and of multimedia, political art. He has directed several 16mm films and videos and has acted in several feature films. He is the author of 31 published books, two feature film scripts and there are 51 catalogs and 8 books about his works. He is the co-founder and acting President of Uluslararası Plastik Sanatlar Derneği (UPSD-Turkish Plastic Arts Association), which is a member of International Association of Art (IAA)—an official partner of UNESCO. Baykam was elected as the World President of the IAA at 18th General Assembly in Plzen in 2015, with his term lasting until February 2023. In 2011, Baykam’s proposal during the 17th General Assembly of IAA World in Guadalajara/Mexico for a World Art Day on the birthday of Leonardo da Vinci was accepted unanimously by participant countries. Since then, every year a growing number of artist associations in several countries celebrate “World Art Day.” In 2019, UNESCO accepted the Baykam's proposal to make World Art Day one of UNESCO's International Days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Baykam has also been a columnist for several Turkish publications including <em>Tempo</em>, <em>Siyah-Beyaz</em>, <em>Aydınlık</em>, <em>Akşam</em> and <em>OdaTv</em>. He has written daily in İstanbul's <em>Cumhuriyet</em> for many years. He was a Party Assembly Member of CHP, the Turkish social democrats, during the second half of the 1990s and a Presidential candidate for the same Party in 2003.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bedri Baykam founded Piramid Publishing  in 1998 and Piramid Sanat, an art center, in 2006 in Taksim Square, İstanbul. He is married to Sibel Baykam and they have a son, Suphi (b. 1999).</p>

<p><strong>BB:</strong> Did you see yesterday the Royal Philharmonic and Royal Academy of Arts were putting up posts about World Art Day? Famous artists too, and most important to me, little kids! From all over the world. This is how I envisioned it. Not something official that has to be tight and constipated. See this logo—you can use it, a kid can use it, a school can use it, it’s not protected or anything. And on April 15th, everyone can use this logo and make posts… it’s a celebration of the love for art, art for universal peace, art for dialog, art beyond boundaries.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM: </strong>Especially since one of the more notable highlights in your rather prolific career is your tenure as President of the IAA (International Association of Art). Did you have this World Art Day concept in mind going into the presidency?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I became president of the IAA in 2015. I had my proposal for World Art Day accepted in 2011, when I was president of the Turkish association. We brought it forward as a proposal and it was accepted unanimously at the IAA World General Assembly in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 2015 I became world president of the organization. Because of Covid it lasted much longer than I thought. Instead of four years, it lasted seven.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And what was that process like—bringing a day of international art appreciation to fruition?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2018 I brought the proposal to the UNESCO director to actually get it into effect, and the office said we had to put it on the agenda before the General Conference. But because it had been initially accepted in Guadalajara, we had to talk to the Mexican ambassador. But also, as it was a proposal from the Turkish national committee, we had to talk to the Turkish ambassador and make it a joint effort. First the Turkish ambassador said, that’s very difficult…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">They didn’t want to get involved?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right, but here is somebody who doesn’t take no for an answer. We kept up the pressure. Finally, the Turkish ambassador got in touch with the Mexican ambassador and they managed to place it on the agenda, first to go to the Executive Committee of UNESCO. For that I went to UNESCO with my General Assistant Öykü Eras, my right hand for many years, and we lobbied like hell and talked to about 12 different ambassadors for them to help us. After it was accepted at the Executive Committee, it was accepted a few months later at the General Conference of UNESCO and thus became an official day.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">As a self-designated “guerilla” however, so much of your story actually begins in the Bay Area, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Berkeley has been a very decisive place in my career. When I was a working artist in Berkeley, I practically lived at Caffè Strada [formerly Caffè Roma] on College and Bancroft. Every morning I had the same routine. Living in North Oakland not far from CCAC, I would wake up, make plans, and hit the road to Strada. I always had breakfast there, talked to a few friends, flirted with a few girls, and then I would hit the road again for errands—the photo shop if I’d any contacts to be developed, or the laundry or the paint supply shop—and then every afternoon from 2:30 - 7:00 I would paint. After 7 pm I would go out. The next day it would start all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over several years—my visa allowed me only six months at a time—maybe I produced 100 paintings, around six feet by eight feet. It was a real working factory! I also wrote in Caffè Strada—I would read, I would sketch, take notes about the paintings I wanted to do. That all happened at Strada.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And you produced your San Francisco Manifesto. Penguin recently included it in its <em>Why Are We ‘Artists’? 100 World Art Manifestos</em>, right? How did this manifesto come to be?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was at CCAC I was doing large expressionist paintings. John Streetz [Vice President of Student Affairs] liked my paintings. One day he said there’s a show being prepared for next year at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoMA) on New Expressionism and I should contact this person at the museum so they can have a look at my work. So I wrote to the museum and they wrote back saying, we don’t have time to see your work, but if you have any other friends from the Middle East, maybe you can find an alternative space and do a show like, Middle Eastern New Expressionist Paintings from the Bay Area with, you know, your five artist friends… Something like that.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wrote back saying ""thanks very much."" Then I added, ""without looking or listening, just because we are from 'the Middle East' we should be grouped? First of all, do you think you can find New Expressionist painters from the Middle East in every region of the US? Like we’re biscuits from Safeway or something?"" I told him I couldn’t believe the level of prejudice, segregation, etc., and he actually wrote back offering some kind of apology but nothing about an opening. Not even a courtesy visit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This weighed heavily on me. I kept analyzing the situation, I kept looking back… so this is the way they build every decade of art history. They invite five countries, they call it “international”—and it’s always the same five countries, the same museums and galleries that deal with each other you know, “you scratch my back I scratch your back,” and they define the new names of the decade and hike the gallery prices up and everybody will be happy. Then the same artists are sent to Paris, to Rome, to London, etc. to earn their certificate of prestige or whatever. So I wrote a manifesto to denounce that. I opened by saying: “Is the Western World Once Again in the Process of Building Modern Art History as Solely the History of Occidental Artists?” The show was called “The Human Condition” but if you’re gonna behave like this you should have called your show “The Human Condition in Zurich and Chicago.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Is this what led to <em>Monkeys’ Right to Paint</em>? You seem to expand directly on that topic there…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I said, this made me realize how similar things had been done in the past. We had a very sterile art history full of the same countries. I continued researching in the field and in museums and books and the first part of the book is about what I found and experienced. I gave examples: Here is an artwork from Zaire, and here is Paul Klee, and here is [A.R.] Penck, an artist from around my generation. They all look essentially the same. If today I painted like this, they’d say, “This Bedri guy paints like Penck.” Nobody would say he paints like a Zairian. Because the behavior goes that if the Western artist touches something from Eastern or Southern cultures, he believes—and so do the curators and museum directors—that the copyright has passed on to him. When Western artists directly use work from other cultures, it’s an ""inspirational act,” when a non-Western artist works Surrealism into their own pieces, they're accused of “derivative art.” But in fact Surrealism itself owes so much to those cultures!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years, in the ‘80s and ‘90s, I encountered curators from the West saying, “You're Turkish, let’s see the Turkishness in your art.” Or if you’re Colombian, “Let’s see the Colombian in your art…” always looking for an ethnic, folklorist touch, you know, the kind of clothing or artifacts they would buy if they went there as a tourist. If you meet a French or Italian or English artist, do you ask to see their <em>Britishness</em>, their <em>Frenchness </em>in their art? So the book had to answer to all the Devil’s Advocates. It was defining our right to make and participate in Contemporary art… Do we have the right to make Contemporary art just like an American, or a French person? Or are we just their regionalized little monkeys?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s funny is that when American art was still fighting to be taken seriously in the ‘40s, the art establishment attacked Jackson Pollock for doing something that wasn't in the “American” vernacular! And Pollock’s answer ended up speaking for the rest of us, you know, saying that being just an American or Italian or otherwise “regional” artist means not having reached the universal level of art because art does not belong to any nationality. It is beyond the limits of borders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">[Jackson Pollock as quoted in <em>Monkeys’ Right to Paint</em>, 1994]: The idea of an isolated American painting, so popular in the country during the ‘30s, seems absurd to me, just as the idea of creating a purely American mathematics or physics would seem absurd … And in another sense, the problem doesn’t exist at all, or, if it did, would solve itself: An American is an American, and his painting would naturally be qualified by that fact, whether he wills it or not. But … the basic problems of contemporary painting are independent of any one country.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<p>The establishment forgot they’d first labeled this Abstract Expressionist work as non-American, or derived from Europe. Pollock, Motherwell, Rothko all had to fight to say this art is universal. As time passed, and here came commercialism, and the museums and history labeled and identified them as American to the point where people look at it and call it American art. But Pollock first said this is not American, it's universal.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Did you find that your book had the impact you set out to make?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That book was a pioneering book for the rights of non-Western artists. I think it did change—the manifesto and the book—the vision and spirit of many art writers. Particularly the two most prolific art historians in Europe and the United States: Edward Lucie-Smith, from Britain and Peter Selz in the United States. Lucie-Smith started really <em>looking</em> after encountering those ideas and talking with me, realizing the kind of misuse of rights that had been happening. He really enlarged his scope and started traveling much more to Middle Eastern countries, and to Asia, all around the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made my “Cultural guerilla raid” on the SFMoMA on June 30-July 1 1984. The first day was the opening of the exhibition. The second was the date of the symposium... there were many important speakers including Clement Greenberg and Marcia Tucker from New York, Achille Bonita Oliva from Italy, and Peter Selz from California. Henry Hopkins was the SFMoMA Director. I entered the symposium after distributing my Manifesto and the contents of it was raised by several persons. Hopkins was very evasive and apologetic and vowed to be open to all races. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some time later, I visited the office of Peter Selz at UC Berkeley. He was not there. I left him a note with my name and number. He called me back the next day and left me a message. Up to today I can hear his voice in my brain telling me his number. I called back. We made an appointment. He came to my studio. We became very close. Peter was so open with me, he was the opposite of all the walls I had encountered in my life in America. In 1986 he wrote an essay for the catalog of my show at the Atatürk Cultural Center. He also wrote about me in his famous book <em>Beyond the Mainstream</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that—until his death few years ago—we kept a close dialogue and friendship. He always invited me—and my wife when we traveled together—to his home for dinner and Carole, his wife, always prepared a great table for us. He introduced me to other writers, gallerists, etc. He was almost like a second father in the USA for me. He credited me for the contents of my Manifesto and said that he liked not only my art but also my revolutionary ideas as culminated in <em>Monkeys' Right to Paint.</em></p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How would you personally define the rights that you've been talking about, these rights of the artists? Is it the right to self-determination?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There have been so many shows called Expressionism, Pop Art, Postmodern Art, or Political Art that over the years were almost purely all-Western. In the last few years we’ve seen it changing little by little with curators now, as I said, looking more broadly. But when you look at the retrospectives chosen, you look at the monographs published, or the major feature articles in major art magazines, you see that 80-85% remain purely Western.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or take the purchases by major museums. In the Olympics, or better yet the football World Cup, Morocco can make it to the semi-finals and there’s nothing the rich countries can do. If they won they won. Or if this runner from some African country did the 100m in 8.7 seconds or whatever, he’ll get the gold and there’s nothing they can do. And it’s all visible data. On the contrary, in the art world everything happens behind closed doors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the past 40 years I’ve been to the same museums and I’ve seen the same artists: Basquiat, Haring, David Salle, Julian Schnabel—who’s my friend and I like his work, don't get me wrong. I’m not putting any of these artists down, I respect them. Or Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Frank Stella, etc. The point is that the museums have been taken hostage by the galleries. See if the galleries deal with the artists I mentioned, they can make the price go up, saying “You better buy Basquiat now, because he's about to have another retrospective in Zurich which will be followed by another retrospective in Chicago, followed by Vancouver. So, you better trust me, we might be adding another zero to that price soon.” The collector feels he has to buy right away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here in the US, in most of the museums, the state changes, the museum’s name changes but so much of the works on display are always the same! A few Warhol, a few Rauschenberg, a few Ellsworth Kelly, a few Basquiat (if they can afford them). And the American art public is condemned to see only them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, I look at my 4Ds [Baykam’s lenticular paintings]. I went to the Broad again recently and saw many nice works, but if those 4Ds were there, I think they’d attract a lot of attention because people have never seen them. Now there are some lenticulars popping up here and there but not comparable in size. And I’ve been doing them for 16 years! But only the people who went to my gallery or saw the minor museum shows in Berlin, Paris, and LA are even <em>aware</em> of them. I know there are many artists from Tunisia, or Colombia, or India, or Iran that are in similar situations.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You went back to Türkiye after CCA, when exactly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After ‘87. I started to do a lot of political art because I felt I had to make the public aware of the dangers of the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. I did very large live installations with sound and music and edited newspapers, with interviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These blockbuster exhibitions in Türkiye could be apolitical or political. I called them ""LivArt"" and they meant shows that could touch the five senses: things to smell, things to touch, things to see, plus humor, eroticism, theater, actors I’d place in situations in the gallery…&nbsp;Do you know how many contemporary art museums my country has? Atatürk erected a museum in Istanbul, and then after his death we erected one in Ankara. Since then we have opened <em>no</em> museums. <em>Zero</em>. And we have <em>111,000 mosques</em>. There are some private museums opened over the last 15-16 years. My art center is private, Istanbul Modern is private. But the state has done nothing. So the relationships between museums internationally that are so important to exporting work and raising awareness is zero.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">But you’ve still managed to have major exhibitions—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only from my own force and the art, nothing through the usual channels… I had big shows in Havana, at the Museum of the Revolution, and I had big shows about the ‘68 Generation—the famous 1968 movements. On the 30th, 40th and 50th anniversaries of 1968, I had big shows. The first one, the 30th, was my solo show. The 40th and 50th I had a couple of works in them but they were large shows I curated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The LivArt thing had a big press impact on <em>Le monde</em> in Paris, the <em>Guardian </em>in London. I also had an installation with real machine guns and cannons that were transported to my show that depicted Atatürk’s time in a large cultural center bearing his name. You had soundtracks of war, battle installations, in a way it was a political version of LivArt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">And where did you go from there?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years I worked on transparencies of paintings. I call them transparent layers. Then I did transparent photos, photos printed and laid out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">You were painting layers—image on image?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I was double-printing photography. Like the one called <em>My Mona Lisa</em>. The bed is made out of a photo of the ocean and then another photo of the girl. So before coming to those 4Ds, I worked on the transparency of paint, of photos, and the depth of materials. Like using mylar on some parts, or fabrics that are transparent and using them on the canvas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">How would you precisely define ""transparent layers""?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abstract canvas works with very many thin layers of paint overlapping each other. My best work from this series is in the collection of Istanbul Modern, called <em>A World on Its Own. </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right before the 4Ds, was my series Lolitart(e) that used some large collages, including textiles and mylar, with transparencies, as well as my collages. The most important work of that series is <em>Segolene, Ma Reine</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So after working on those when I met the lenticular surface I knew I’d met <em>bingo</em>! I knew it would reach a greater depth and I knew I’d succeed in rendering this depth. So those 4Ds are the result of, on the one hand, 30 years of collage work, but also, especially in the last 10 years this transparency concept. I’m an artist who doesn't like to repeat himself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">So you were, in a way, eschewing a signature aesthetic?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was 24, I wrote a manifesto—my first—saying I want to be recognized by my attitude, in constant development, always changing my line of thought. I didn't want to be recognized by a repetitive visual image that’s going to become my grave. In Türkiye there were a lot of fights in the ‘80s between abstract artists and figurative artists. But I laughed because I couldn’t be defined as a figurative or an abstract artist. According to my mood, sometimes I would paint abstractly, sometimes I would paint more of a story… it would be very real, according to what I lived or what I felt. There would never be any law that says you can paint with the figure or paint without the figure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I had to convince people about the political dangers in Türkiye I had to give them a touch of history, but with a slap in the face, with installations carrying heavy soundtracks and this and that. Then came LivArt. Or sometimes my ideas didn't have their counterparts directly in visual art so I wrote a novel, <em>The Bone</em>. Or when teaching an art history class three years ago… 30 years ago I had already done a summary map of this [pointing to the <em>Art History Map</em>]. But this time I decided to be very precise. The <em>Art History Map</em> developed itself in front of my students. In five months they saw it coming to life. When people ask, how long did that take you? It took me five months, but <em>50 years</em> plus five months, like Picasso said. 50 years of comparing, researching, visiting, thinking, agreeing, disagreeing… This map makes some interesting suggestions to anyone open-minded. For example, that Pop art starts with Hokusai.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">So that would be both an organic conception but also a concerted attempt to resist the ""global art history"" narrative—</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Right, the ""authoritative"" encyclopedic narrative, you wanted to resist that—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. For one, an American art historian could not have done it. They just don’t look equally at the West and the East. On the other hand, this generation works with computers. And on computers you could not develop it. You’re limited to a space like this [he outlines the size of a computer]. You had to create this piece in <em>space</em>, as an artist that works with his hands—his hands and his eyes and his brains. So I came up with this relatively tall and narrow map summarizing all art history and in parallel to that the political and sociological history of the world, mainly in detail from the Renaissance until the start of Covid.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And yet, you seem to be so heavily influenced by American popular culture. How were you exposed to American culture growing up in Türkiye? And was that something you culturally embraced at the time or was it something you were skeptical towards?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never resisted American popular culture. I embraced it. Turkish newspapers had many comics and cartoons, especially Western, particularly one paper I followed. This is how I learned to read and write before school, because my parents sent me to French school because they said “he’s going to become an artist.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Is that what drew you to the Kennedy assassination? [Baykam has produced a variety of works that touch on President Kennedy's Assassination on November 22, 1963.] </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To me that moment is so solidly engrained. I heard it on the radio—there was no television for me until I was 11. We heard it on the radio and everybody was in shock. The new generations would not know that, because American presidents are no longer much loved around the world. But Kennedy was like the president of the world. Probably 60 or 65% of Turks cried—including the Leftists. Because it was for us so taken for granted how much he was fighting for universal peace, he didn’t want nuclear war, he was bringing rights to Blacks, he was trying to defend the poor and the middle classes, it was obvious. We felt so close to him… Plus the way he handled his life was so attractive—he was on postage stamps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kennedy was even not just a part of political life but pop culture. In those years, Türkiye and the United States were very close. It was later, after Kennedy, after the Vietnam War accelerated, and the US' growing imperialism that we changed our perception… Nicaragua, the Iraqi invasion, etc. But all those years when I grew up the reception was total, we had nothing against American culture.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was obviously commanded by a religious sect.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a friend of mine, Mehmet Aksoy, who made a sculpture in Kars, in eastern Türkiye. There is a long line of struggles and misunderstandings between Turks and Armenians. But this was meant to be a “Monument of Humanity and Friendship” between Turks and Armenians.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Which is not the official line, correct?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Erdogan wanted to destroy this monument.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Because the state doesn't acknowledge the genocide—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s a long story. Let’s say this would turn into a different interview if I answered that in full detail. This was supposed to be a monument of fraternity between Turks and Armenians. We said, hey whatever happened in the past, please bring your archives and historians and we’ll bring ours and we’ll talk friendly and we’ll have an impartial meeting, bring a judge or what-have-you from some other country and we’ll see what happens and we’ll do whatever it takes. But Erdogan, who supposedly also wanted this big meeting between historians and archivists, wanted it to be destroyed. So we put on a press conference to protect this monument from destruction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the press conference, I was going back to my car with two of my assistants to put away my books and dossier, etc. Now two minutes earlier someone had asked me if I was going to my art center, they’re going in that direction. I normally take hitchhikers, but this time I was not going that way. In fact I had an appointment at the art center with a collector but by some miracle that day she canceled. So, I was going home to work on the catalog for my new series about the history of the Roland-Garros tennis tournament which I was preparing for the Roland-Garros Museum. If I had decided to go to the art center, this guy would have hopped in the car, behind my assistant and me, and he would have slashed our throats. At least mine for sure, as he stated later at the police station.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had been following me for a week or so. As he confessed later, he had heard us talking in the lobby before the press conference. He must have heard us joking “it’s crazy we gotta have bulletproof vests to defend a monument!” And because he didn’t understand jokes—thank God—he really thought we had vests. So he decided to put the Rambo knife he was carrying here [gesturing to his side] instead of into my chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So as I’m putting books in my car I feel this <em>boom</em> in my side. I didn’t think I was stabbed, I thought it’s probably some old friend, who hasn’t seen me in years saying “hey where you been!” with heavy hands. Suddenly I turned and saw the huge knife with blood that he had put in me and I realized I had been expecting that attack now for 25 years… exactly 25 years.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, since I came back from the States when I was raising hell in articles and speeches against Islamization. The doctor who saved me told me ""You have two birthdays now, not just April 26 but also April 18 because today I remade you."" He said it very bluntly.… The Rambo knife was so close to my main artery—three millimeters. In those years I was a little chubbier and that saved me life. The doctor said I would have died in one minute, two minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Now I’m a Turk, I’m secular, democratic. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk created the modern Türkiye, the secular, democratic Türkiye, with the universal rhetoric for peace and brotherhood. Those who follow his ideas are called Kemalists. When you're a Kemalist you can be killed with a bullet, you can be imprisoned, but they can never scare you. It's a different mentality. When I got stabbed, eight different writers who wrote for the same newspaper that I wrote for, <em>Cumhuriyet</em><strong><em> </em></strong>(like the equivalent of <em>Le monde</em>), had been murdered—eight of my close friends with whom I talked daily about politics. In 2008-11 hundreds of journalists were placed in jail, at least 15 of them my friends, Kemalist writers. They stayed in jail for eight years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The religious sect that infiltrated the state and made a failed coup d’etat in 2016 had also prepared a warrant for my arrest, but later they were arrested themselves some eight-to-ten years ago. But none of these things end up scaring you because you live in a geography where the art, politics, and the literary/journalistic life are intermixed. Because you have to be in a free country to have free expression. All these values are worth fighting or dying for. It’s difficult for the Western mind to really understand the depth of those problems. France, Germany, and the US have problems but they don’t become like Iran, Syria—like Türkiye, which is in a better situation compared to Iran, but it’s still bad—much worse than in Europe.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Do you consider yourself an artist within a specific lineage or progression?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Picasso is my “friend” from art history, and I have a big respect for him. His versatility, the way women influenced his art, the way he changes his style dynamically and can go between them, the way he doesn't repeat himself. He has several defining images, not one, not two. So all the work we do doesn’t look terribly similar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact that today I'm not in the same big museums does not change the state of my ambition. You know of course the big example is Van Gogh. If I was a tennis player and I didn’t compete in major tournaments for lack of funds or whatever after I turned 40, I would have said, shit I goofed. And I’d become a coach. Art is not like this. Maybe in 50 years I will be way ahead. What matters is the production of everything we talked about. What matters is the uniqueness in all these multiple struggles made simultaneously. It's like having a duel with five devils at the same time. Because good art gives you breath, gives you vision, and when you know how to handle it it’s as necessary as air in your system… it’s wind in your sails.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My work doesn’t look at all like David Hockney, but I like his work very much. I find him very stimulating. I like very much an American that not many know: Stuart Davis, who’s a precursor to Pop art… maybe 15, 20, 25 years before the birth of Pop in the 1960s. His famous matchbox and things like that. So there are artists like that or from past centuries. Like Marcel Duchamp. My work does not look like Duchamp and the readymades. But I do parallel works with Picasso and I do parallel works with Marcel.&nbsp;Right now I'm preparing a show in Paris of my interpretations of <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em>, all types of versatile works based around it. It has to do also with my work that's in the Istanbul Modern, <em>I wish I had a harem.</em></p>

<p class=""interviewer"">So you paint homages sometimes—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes. Especially since 1987. I did many works around Ingres, Gérôme, Picasso, Hopper, Van Gogh, Delacroix, Géricault, Picabia etc… I also had a joint show with Edvard Munch at the Pinacotheque Museum in Paris. Also, one of my most important series, EmptyFrame, is an homage to Duchamp.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">And yet you had quite a graffiti period in New York in the 1980s.  Where did that come from?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started doing graffiti as a reaction to the problems I mentioned surrounding my Manifesto and this fight against prejudice. I was a first-generation New Expressionist artist, but of course, none of my works entered the shows labeled as new German painting, new Italian painting, new French painting, or new American painting! Because I was a Turk and the Ministry of Culture in my country had no museum and no relation with foreign ministries or museums, they just had no idea what was going on. So I started spraying all over the streets of Soho in New York City, slogans like “Meet the Turk” since I, the Turk, could enter none of these exhibitions! Then my graffiti developed as full sentences, written with the spray can in Turkish. &nbsp;I wanted New Yorkers to see and feel languages and worlds they didn’t know.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Beyond pop culture and Pop art, your paintings allude to history and to literature, and you write as well. Two recent pieces include homages to Jack Kerouac and Charles Bukowski. I was curious why you chose them specifically. As writers they are diametrically opposed to the roles that you’ve espoused, which are more reminiscent of André Malraux or Vaclav Havel… Why’d you choose these misfits who eschewed public life completely?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a very good question. Sure, my political struggle can be viewed in the lineage of Malraux or Havel, but within my art, within my boiling brain, my influence zones would be much closer to Kerouac and Bukowski, and to Arthur Rimbaud or Baudelaire, or Kafka.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In CCAC, there was a wall done in the Siqueiros style, capitalism v workers, the way Russians would do anti-capitalist murals. Well, in the school newspaper I wrote an article against those murals. I said look, we’re in one of the most advanced schools of art in the world and these walls are always in front of the students, so dominating, so didactic, it kills me. Of course, the teacher who was responsible for the walls got angry and wrote a reply. And then I wrote back and there was this back-forth going on in the school campus—again the rebel-<em>agent provocateur</em> in action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So one day I was walking on campus and the literature teacher, whom I knew but I wasn't in his class, stopped me: “Are you the guy writing the articles about the walls and the murals?” I thought shit he's probably going to chew me out but what can I do? I said “Yes, that’s me.” “Well young man, keep on writing…. Don’t stop.” I was relieved and thanked him. The man was Michael McClure. In ‘82 I didn't know how big he was, that he was one of the big Beat generation names. But I felt I got this “go ahead my friend” from the Beat generation. I wish I had taken his class. There’s a Turkish equivalent to Bukowski in one of the 4Ds, the Turkish writer Erje Ayden, he lived in New York in the ‘60s and ‘70s. He was a friend of de Kooning’s. He had some cult bestsellers like <em>The Crazy Green of Second Avenue</em>. I translated them to Turkish and published them in Türkiye.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Do you believe there is a purely aesthetic or spiritual realm to art, as in art as play or art as prayer—a realm independent from the political—or is all art inherently political?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be very political or very down-to-earth, or very inclusive, or very solitary.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">So even as an outsider, a non-establishment, non-Western artist, with this emphasis on politicization you find you can have a private, spiritual artwork that exists outside the realm of the political?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah. I've been producing art for 60 years. For instance if a museum said Mr. Baykam, we'll give you a mini-mini retrospective with only ten works, one of them would have to be <em>The Prostitute’s Room</em>. On the right-hand side there is a broken mirror and you see yourself entering the room, one would be that.&nbsp;One would be <em>This Has Been Done Before</em>. Maybe one would be a drawing of <em>The Cavalry</em> from when I was six, one of them would be my <em>Empty Frame</em>. You know Kim Levin?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Yeah, she's an art critic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kim Levin wrote about the <em>Empty Frame</em> in 2013 following one of my show in New York. It would be one of them because of the way I criticize Koons and Damien Hurst for the way they keep taking this Duchampian readymade approach and try to endlessly overuse it to death. Here, I could just keep the chairs and make a new show with a bunch of chairs and put them in an installation, and I could call you and say, write an article that says, “Art, Is it for sitting?” Or is this readymade in use or not in use, or is it pure material? You can develop a thesis around all these lines and whatever else I can't even imagine…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I said, forget your obsession with Duchamp's object approach. Just go out into space, place a frame and it becomes a readymade moment. If I place the frame between us the frame is not empty because if I put the frame between us I see an image of you framed, as a frame would take in a painting. You could see a million different things, it would change all the time, with the light, the vantage point, your eyes… so the <em>Empty Frame</em> becomes a fabricator of images. Forget your obsession with the object and move on to space. Have readymade moments, not readymade objects. If Duchamp saw <em>Empty Frame</em>, he would have said, shit, I should have thought of that—I <em>could</em> have thought of that. But because he's not, in that regard, a competitive person, he would have smiled and said, listen young man, you played a funny mind game, I like it… There were ads in Asian magazines with me smiling mischievously which read: “Duchamp would have been damn jealous.”</p>

<p><strong>DISPATCHED BY MY EDITOR</strong> one afternoon in May to a private showing of paintings by Edward Biberman at a certain Gallery Z, I snaked my way up Benedict Canyon, awash with the vaguely Italian whites and greens and terracottas of the world above Sunset. “Gallery Z” was a mid-century house nestled somewhere high up Tower Grove Drive in Beverly Hills. In February, I caught the major Edward Hopper exhibition at the Whitney in New York that detailed—sketch by solemn sketch—the melancholy New Yorker’s journey from commercial illustrator to master of American urban alienation. From the one Biberman painting I knew, it was apparent that this Edward too understood something lurking within the very surfaces of <em>his</em> city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I parked just past my destination, across from a house where disgraced Universal Studios head, “baby boss” Carl Laemmle, Jr., lived in seclusion until his death in 1979. After lingering in my car to listen to the rest of an NBA playoff game while looking out at a sun-soaked canyon, I walked back down the road to the only open door on the block, greeted by the delicate hum of a small reception. Throughout, the off-white interior wore the Bibermans like a dame inseparable from her jewels, the walls clearly accustomed to the works of masters. Pairs and small groups of people middle-aged and older took in the spare, oil-on-canvas depictions of SoCal urbanism from the foyer through the dining room to the lounge and back again. Outside, more people gathered on the terrace and in the tree-lined garden which looked out to the smoggy sprawl in the distance rising out of the earth like some sullen mirage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I strolled I froze at one piece, narrow and nearly four feet tall, that depicted the white wall of a four-story apartment building stained by photorealist shadows of palm trees. A familiar enough scene, and yet I was overcome with a sense of ease <em>and </em>unease, a feeling both encouraged and masked by the pace of daily urban life. I picked up a catalog and a price list. Matching numbers with what I’d just seen, I spotted <em>Shadow &amp; Substance</em>, 1960, for a cool $65,000 (“plus applicable sales tax”). I opted instead for the small bar in the corner offering beverages gratis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I continued along, struck by the way each painting captured subtle variations in the tenor of California’s mid-century built environment. I paused a while at <em>Freeway Divide</em>, another geometric mood piece from 1960. Two parallel concrete overpasses met at the center of the canvas; every one of the support columns sectioned off a windowpane-like space of blue, every pane a different shade. The whole painting was at once ecclesial and unholy. It was time to find Chris Walther, of CW Modernism, who’d put ""the Architectural World of Edward Biberman"" together.</p>

<p>Exchanging my empty wine glass for a bottle of imported beer, the man at the bar pointed me in Walther’s direction. He was dressed in dark blue jeans and a lightweight navy sport coat over a light-colored button-up. Chris and I exchanged pleasantries before he walked me through the exhibit. Edward Biberman, as I would soon learn, was born in Philadelphia in 1904, the son of Ukrainian Jews from Kyiv. His older brother Herbert became a screenwriter and director, and wound up going from Hollywood stalwart to Hollywood Ten. (He never recovered.) At his brother’s urging, Edward arrived in Los Angeles in 1936, already something of an innovator, following requisite stints in Paris and New York where he’d immersed himself in the explosive period and refined his artistic vision—a “unique form of modernism that mediated between abstraction and mimetic verisimilitude,” according to Walther.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We stopped to admire a few spectral works from the mid-30s: <em>Oil Tanks/Storage Tanks</em>, 1936, <em>Subdivision/Mandalay Beach</em>, 1936, and the haunting <em>Loudspeakers</em>, 1937. As early as 1932, “Biberman,” Walther notes in the exhibition catalog, “began an obsession with the use of floating squares, rectangles, and other geometric shapes of sometimes contrasting, sometimes complementary, colors” to define and shape space, light, and mood. Biberman’s meditative, entrancing results, we agreed, predated Rothko’s color field studies by at least 10-12 years. By removing human life altogether from his structural works, Biberman absolved the urban landscape of the burden of being, pre-ordaining a path that would soon enrapture Rothko. Through the use of color and shape and his eye for light, Biberman endowed the built environment with a spiritual quality, a hallowed interiority, and—most important of all—a sense of mystery. In <em>Wilshire-Coronado Corner</em> (1938), a <em>noir</em> for the spiritual realm, a wan and empty intersection exhibiting yesterday and tomorrow’s architecture is pregnant with choice: Down what road shall my soul roam?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the politically charged 1930s gave way to the ambiguities of the 1940s, the moral panic of the ‘50s, and the vivid complexities of the ‘60s, Biberman’s architecturally-oriented “structural” works grew more and more precise and starkly contemplative. There is a mournful serenity to the L.A. light Biberman begins to capture in the 1950s and ‘60s, and that he masters by the ‘70s in works like <em>13 Windows </em>(c. 1970s) and <em>Esprit </em>(1979). It seemed that, in the face of his socialist convictions, the equivocacy of mid-century American politics juxtaposed with the consumerist bent of American society forced the avowed Social realist inwards, toward a highly evolved sublimation.</p>

<p>Walther moved on and I started a conversation with an older man from Philadelphia in a plaid shirt and a baseball cap. I told him the Sixers had beat the Celtics in overtime to keep their playoff hopes alive. Jack, as he was called, seemed more content to talk about L.A., particularly his own painting practice, which he conducts daily from what must be the spectacularly lit confines of his easterly 11th floor studio at the Asbury Apartments on Sixth Street. Built by Alspaugh &amp; Russell in 1925 in the Beaux Arts-Spanish Revival style, the Asbury Apartments are a remarkable 13-story tower in L.A.’s Westlake district. By wondrous coincidence, I told him, I can see a slice of its white façade—à la Biberman—everyday from the window of my apartment, which looks up Carondelet toward Wilshire, one short block east of the aforementioned street-corner meditation from 1938.</p>

<p>Outside on the terrace where delicate hints of dry grass and verbena rode a languid breeze, I met Suzanne Zada, the “Z” in Gallery Z. Zada’s is a remarkable tale. A renowned art collector, she emigrated to Los Angeles from Hungary in 1957 having survived the horrors of Auschwitz. Sophisticated in that Old World manner, Zada comes across full of harbored vitality, enlivened by a transportive Hungarian accent. She has championed Biberman for over 50 years, more fervently so since his death in 1986. Jules Renard once wrote that if money doesn't make you happy, then try giving it back. But in Los Angeles, survival was a badge best worn rich, and these hills of chaparral, oatgrass, and deluxe property values seemed to exist only to offer ephemeral tributes—sometimes even deserved—to mortality interrupted.</p>

<p>The spring afternoon idled away and I itched to descend, back into the web. I wondered if paintings are only alive the minute they are completed, their paint still wet, the rest a sort of radioactive decay? I don’t know why I thought this. All this wealth and death and polite conversation. It was time to leave. The 124 Spider I’d borrowed to meet the day started to life with a throaty growl. Down I sped, from the rarified realm of the hills back into the spindly sequences of anonymous city blocks Biberman did so well to illuminate.</p>

<p><strong>“Anything that comes out of a writer,”</strong> Benjamín Labatut has said, “is fiction.” Born in Rotterdam and now living in Santiago, Labatut is best known for his genre-defying <em><a href=""https://www.nyrb.com/products/when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">When We Cease to Understand the World</a></em>, which received near-unanimous acclaim when its translation from the Spanish appeared in 2020. The fictional characters in his books are real-life scientists, people whose conceptual breakthroughs have led to death and destruction at scales that seem almost metaphysical, but he is not a historian of science. Written in English, <em><a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/725022/the-maniac-by-benjamin-labatut/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">The MANIAC</a></em>, Labatut’s latest book, is a dreamlike examination of the tormented visionaries to whom he is drawn like cobalt to a magnetic field. It is also a mediation on the ways that certain forms of reason and extreme mental power can verge on madness, atavism, and apocalypse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Formally, <em>The MANIAC</em> is a nested triptych: a three-part inquiry whose middle splits into three further segments. Labatut, who refuses to call the book a novel, focuses on three exceptional figures: the theoretical physicist Paul Ehrenfest (1880–1933), the mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann (1903–1957), and the master go player Lee Sedol (b. 1983). His default narrative voice is suitably godlike, aloof but grandiose. One of his epigraphs to the second part of <em>The MANIAC</em> is a long quotation from Adam Curtis’s 2021 documentary series <em>Can’t Get You Out of My Head</em>, and his style shares much with Curtis’s stern end-times sermonizing. When he’s not careful, his sensationalizing approach obscures the fact that his subjects were actual human beings. Take his introduction of John von Neumann, which is split into italicized fragments across a dozen pages and sounds like the voiceover to an action-movie trailer from the nineties: “<em>He was the smartest human being of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</em>” [turn the page] “<em>An alien among us.</em>” Four pages later: “<em>His name was Neumann János Lajos.</em>” [turn the page] “<em>A.k.a. Johnny von Neumann.</em>” (By which flawed measure of intelligence is Labatut measuring “smartest,” anyway?)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The brief first part of <em>The MANIAC</em> follows the life and horrific death of the Austrian physicist Paul Ehrenfest, beginning with a sharp shock, hair-raising and nausea-inducing.&nbsp;It’s especially unsettling to read that Ehrenfest, who in September 1933 murdered his 15-year-old developmentally disabled son, nicknamed Wassik, before committing suicide with the same pistol, was no run-of-the-mill sociopathic genius but rather, in Labatut’s characterization, a man of uncommon empathy. “[The] only thing that really sparked joy in Paul,” Labatut writes, “was giving himself to others.” He was an inspiration to the budding physicists who came to study with him in Leiden and remained his devoted admirers, including J. Robert Oppenheimer. Einstein called him “the best teacher in our profession.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How could such a generous person be driven to such an awful act? Ehrenfest loathed fascism, violence, cold logic. He was terrified by the ascent of quantum mechanics—how it replaced “real, physical intuition” with “brute-force artillery,” how it was training his students to become human calculators. In his eyes, physics’ new direction threatened to dehumanize the world, to transform people into automata. (By this point, of course, many branches of science had adopted numerous dehumanizing tendencies essential to war, slavery, and conquest.) Ehrenfest raged against the fate he predicted, his desperation increasing as his career hit the skids and Hitler took power in Germany. No longer, he believed, could he financially provide for or protect his son, who was institutionalized in Amsterdam, nor did he want to burden his wife or other children with Wassik's expenses after his own suicide. Perhaps Labatut’s cautionary tale implies that Ehrenfest, who “was not a computer,” so deeply absorbed the violence and fatalism roiling everything around him that he ended up becoming what he fought so desperately to avoid. In a scene painting the last day of Ehrenfest’s life, Labatut describes him, the murder-suicide weapon in his pocket, as “machinelike, propelled by a force he neither recognized nor understood . . . his legs as stiff as an automaton’s.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is where we leave Ehrenfest, begin the central part of the book, and meet John von Neumann. In Labatut’s telling, von Neumann’s singular mathematical abilities stem from the same source as his “almost childlike moral blindness.” Von Neumann detests fascism just as Ehrenfest did, yet when he sees a parade of Reichswehr tanks he “[begins] to salivate like a dog who hears his master emptying leftovers into his bowl.” Among his contributions to the Manhattan Project, he calculates the height at which the atomic bombs would cause the most destruction when detonated (the bombers use his calculation). His childhood love of a mechanical textile loom becomes one of his primary inspirations when he eventually builds the device after which Labatut names this book—the Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator, and Computer (MANIAC). In von Neumann’s final months, lying in a guarded room at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital that he orders to be filled with toys, he responds to a question from his daughter, Marina, with unsettling solipsism:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">I asked him, point-blank, how he used to be able to contemplate, with total equanimity, the killing of hundreds of millions of people in a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union, and yet he could not face his own mortality with any sense of calm or dignity. “That is entirely different,” he replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Had Labatut chosen to narrate all two hundred pages of von Neumann’s part in his usual godlike style, <em>The MANIAC</em> might have collapsed under its own portentousness. Instead, he makes a narrative decision that opens up the book<em> </em>and makes it richer and more rewarding: He tells von Neumann’s story through the voices of more than a dozen people who knew him. Sometimes the author is visible through the mask; Eugene Wigner in particular, who receives the most space, often lapses into sounding just like Labatut. But the chapters narrated by Richard Feynman, Gábor Szegő, and above all Klára Dán von Neumann are thrilling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":2921,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""http://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Klára-Dán-von-Neumann-her-spouse-John.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-2921""/><figcaption>Klára Dán and her spouse, John von Neumann. Courtesy Los Alamos National Laboratory</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Labatut’s Feynman is chatty, irreverent, an evocative scene-painter, alive to the role of accidents and chance in history. He pinpoints the absurdity of life at Los Alamos, especially against the enormity of their task. Szegő, who relates the story of von Neumann at the Reichswehr parade, is a contrarian, too, but he is also the religious conscience of the book. When he recounts von Neumann’s dreams of a mathematics reduced to axioms without contradictions, he says, “And what kind of an Eden would that be? I wondered. Surely not a place where plants and trees could grow.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The chapters narrated by Dán—the first woman to write modern computer code, and John von Neumann’s wife from 1938 until his death—are the highlights of <em>The MANIAC</em>. Dán plays an essential role in the history of twentieth-century technology, but she resists her husband’s moral tunnel vision. And she does the most to expose the scientists around her as people, not gods. She wanders the woods surrounding Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, rifle in hand, knowing that the men of science nearby were “easy prey for any hunter, because they were so caught up in themselves and completely indifferent to the world outside.” When John can't be bothered to open the garage door, Dán locks John out of his study, threatening to lock his papers on fire as he rages outside like a toddler parted from his favorite plaything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Labatut follows John von Neumann’s early work on mathematics and his involvement with the atomic bomb, he focuses on von Neumann’s formative contributions to computers and AI. Obsessive work on the MANIAC, theoretical leaps, and broken relationships ensue. By the time of his death—and the MANIAC’s retirement around the same time—von Neumann had laid much of the theoretical groundwork for computers as we know them today. It’s astonishing to recall how powerful computers have become in the intervening six or seven decades—and especially how adept they are at playing games.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third and final part of the book recounts the 2016 go match between 9-dan player Lee Sedol and Google DeepMind’s AI-driven AlphaGo program, which AlphaGo won four games out of five. Labatut acknowledges a debt to the 2017 documentary <em>AlphaGo</em>, and his voice here sounds so much like documentary narration, it’s sometimes unclear what sets his version apart. His description of AI’s escalating gameplay abilities is disturbing, recalling his description of humanity’s helplessness before the power of the atomic bomb. But does the story of AlphaGo and Lee Sedol say anything about the world outside the board? In an earlier chapter about John von Neumann’s cofounding of game theory, Labatut has the theory’s co-creator Oskar Morgenstern ask:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Is there really a rational course of action in every situation? Johnny proved it mathematically beyond a doubt, but only for two players with diametrically opposing goals. . . . Life is so much more than a game. Its full wealth and complexity cannot be captured by equations, no matter how beautiful or perfectly balanced.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">AlphaGo’s victory lies in the realm of two players with diametrically opposing goals, and because it does nothing to defy Morgenstern’s pronouncement, I wonder whether this final part adds anything more to <em>The MANIAC</em>. Throughout the book Labatut meditates on games and their role in society; he has Feynman describe go as “really intractable to computation” before we learn otherwise, and Mariette Kövesi wonders to what extent war simulations have fed the human appetite for real wars. Still, if Labatut is interested in the growing power of computers over people, a tightly bound two-player game is not a good model of the actual world.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The games of go and chess work only because their players choose to adhere to the rules of play. The future, however, is not a closed game whose rules we must accept wholesale from people who act as though the future <em>is</em> theirs to master. Klára Dán is a compelling character in <em>The MANIAC</em> precisely because she refuses to play by the rules of the game. She reminds us that sometimes it is in our power to reject the mad dreams of reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the brilliance of a scientist is the starting point for a book, it can obfuscate the book’s search to understand science as a shared human pursuit. <em>When We Cease to Understand the World</em> sometimes succumbed to this problem. <em>The MANIAC</em> does a better job resisting it, albeit an imperfect one. Other novels, like those of Kim Stanley Robinson or Richard Powers, acknowledge that modern science requires a wide range of people who understand the significance of cooperation and collaboration if they wish to get anything significant done. The best books about scientists working together also offer portraits of brilliant individuals in great depth. Robinson, Powers, and Yaa Gyasi, in her 2020 novel <em>Transcendent Kingdom</em>, do this, and so does Richard Rhodes in his superb history <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em>. They can make graceful pivots from the many to the one. Going the other direction is harder.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we hope to undo the notion of individual genius that so many power-hungry tech leaders exploit, we must pierce the aura that surrounds many legendary minds, the aura Labatut both upholds and undercuts throughout <em>The MANIAC</em>. Like the historical figures it centers, Labatut’s latest fiction does not deserve to be encased in a fog of reverence. Let us be skeptical here, at the very least, so we may better scrutinize the godlike narratives that accord today’s titans of STEM. Worship does no justice to science.</p>

2938,"My Dad Is Not Jimmy Buffett","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>MY DAD IS NOT JIMMY BUFFETT</strong>. Six years his junior, and a native <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conch_Republic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Conch</a> rather than an Alabaman transplant, my dad never had a Top 40 hit. A Navy brat (and later, veteran), my dad never played the Troubadour. Now retired, living on a teacher’s pension, my dad never leveraged a themed gift shop into a billion-dollar franchise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if you squint, the lines begin to blur: Both are named James. Both spent their formative years in Key West. Both had fathers and grandfathers who made their lives on the sea. And both eventually traded Florida for New York, though not without suffering the consequences of all that salt-sprayed sunshine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the wake of Jimmy Buffett’s passing, I can’t help but read between the lines. It’s hard to see photos of Buffett’s island years, fooling around in cut-off jeans, without thinking of my dad up on a ladder, fixing our roof during the short summers in upstate New York. It’s impossible for me to hear “Treat Her Like a Lady” or “Mañana” without going back to our unfinished basement, dust in the air as he taught me how to use a table saw. Tales of his own island childhood accompanied hummed renditions of “A Pirate Looks at Forty,” both as real and imagined as the other. Through my father, these stories of sailors and smugglers became more than just music. They became part of my heritage. Part of my identity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For many, this will sound overdone. A songwriter most famous for crooning about cheeseburgers and margaritas hardly seems like a cultural touchstone. But beyond “The Big 8,” the party-centric staples worshiped by Parrotheads nationwide, Buffett’s music offers a kind of “hick wisdom” that’s become almost foreign to modern culture. It’s the same wisdom I gleaned from my dad in borrowed phrases and long-winded yarns, in those backwater anecdotes that taught me how to be human.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy Buffett’s first album was a flop. Released in 1970, <em>Down to Earth</em> sold a mere 324 copies. But somehow, sometime between their last year at Key West High and enrolling at Pensacola Junior College, my dad and his friends caught wind of it. I like to think they listened to “The Captain and the Kid” again and again, the grandfatherly captain reminding them of the sailors that filled the island back then (not to mention the track dedicated to their favorite superhero, Captain America).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buffett himself wouldn’t set foot on Key West until 1971. Tired of the Nashville scene and escaping a failed marriage, he shacked up with musician Jerry Jeff Walker in Miami. Due to a scheduling error, they took an impromptu drive down state route A1A, busking their way across the Keys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy was hooked. Within months, he’d moved into a one-room bungalow on Ann Street, a block from my dad’s childhood home. He played for drinks at the bars along Duval Street, working shrimp boats to make ends meet. He landed his first official gig at Crazy Ophelia’s, before moving on to Howie’s Lounge and The Chart Room, where he met characters like Phillip Clark—the downtrodden smuggler from “A Pirate Looks at Forty.” Soon enough, he was fishing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0psoyXNrhc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">tarpon</a> with Jim Harrison, playing Hank Williams songs by Tennessee Williams’ pool, waking up in strangers’ beds, days drifting by as he wrote ballads like “I Have Found Me a Home” about the quiet simplicity of island life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buffett had discovered my dad’s Key West; an underdeveloped salt marsh at the periphery of America. Back then, it was an isolated island of bar brawls, diving schools, Cuban immigrants, “bohemian” men, cyclical storms, hard-drinking artists and hard-edged seamen—a place where people escaped to, looking for a better life. A place where kids still played stick ball in vacant lots. Where submariners locked themselves into The Brown Derby (now the Green Parrot). Where, on his first night in town, Truman Capote was robbed during a late-night liaison in a motel-owner’s trailer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my dad drove his VW bus up to Pensacola, he knew he wouldn’t find anything like it. But opportunities on the island were scarce. Unless you were in the Navy, the “import-export business” (his euphemism for the drug trade), or your name was Jimmy Buffett, you had to look elsewhere. My dad, never the greatest student, wanted to be a patternmaker. But his draft number was called during his first semester. By the time <em>A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean</em>—Buffett’s first Keys-era record—debuted in 1973, he’d been shipped from boot camp to Vietnam and back again. By 1974, when “Come Monday” broke into the Billboard Top 40, he’d transferred into the fleet. While he was in Scotland, hearing Buffett on the&nbsp; radio reminded him of the home he left behind—the one he already knew he could never really get back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy eventually learned the same lesson. In 1977, he sublet his apartment to Hunter S. Thompson and moved to St. Barts, where he lamented the island’s “growing commercialism” in <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/jimmy-buffett-misadventures-in-paradise-42110/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">an interview</a> with Rolling Stone. But Key West had already gone through several waves of commercialization. In the late 19th century, it was the most prosperous city in Florida. Cuban immigrants fueled its booming cigar-rolling industry. “Wreckers” salvaged the Gulf. Salt was mined. Sponges were harvested. In fact, if it weren’t for the Great Depression (and a devastating hurricane in 1935), it’s unlikely my dad’s family could have afforded even their modest trailer on Greene Street.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Key West, like the rest of America, was a land of booms and busts, of opportunity and poverty. It was a quirk of history and geography that made it such a strange place to grow up—and such a well of inspiration for the artists and troubadours who moved there throughout the 20th century. Closer to Havana than Miami, sun-soaked yet hurricane-battered, and post-industrial before it was cool, the island was unique. But like all quirks of history, it was bound to its own time, destined to change as the years rolled by.</p>

<p>Country music is inseparable from nostalgia. Indeed, the genre has been looking back through rose-tinted glasses ever since the Grand Ole Opry popularized it in the 1920s. For a century, country songs have praised down-home cooking, mourned the drudgery of shiftwork, and suffered through marriage and its discontents, always setting its characters’ lives against the open-air freedom of the West. The promise of America—its dreams, its past, and its unrealized future—is the ghost that haunts the genre. As critic Patrick Anderson observed, in the midst of the “outlaw country” movement of the 1970s, “the country singer, as an embodiment of his audience, looks to the past, mourns a rural paradise lost.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy Buffett never quite fit into country. He got his start in New Orleans, playing for change on Decatur before stumbling into a gig at the Bayou Room on Bourbon Street. And although he landed a two-record deal with Barnaby Records during an abortive stint in Nashville, the failure of his first album led the label to bury the second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth is, Buffett hadn’t yet found his muse. The island life provided the raw material for what critics have called his “shrimp-boat,” “tropical,” and “Gulf &amp; Western” sound. Jimmy himself called it “drunken Caribbean rock n’ roll.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Buffett owes a debt to country music. His lyrics, especially the mid-70s work for which he’s best known, tackle many of the same “everyman” themes. While his characters and locales are unique, his songs explore addiction, depression, regrets, lost love, daydreams, monthly bills, dodging taxes, letting loose, small-time crime, big-time hangovers, fried chicken, honeysuckle vines, and long trips home. They range from the roguishly poetic (“He Went to Paris,” “Wonder Why We Ever Go Home”) to the almost surreally folksy (“Life is Just a Tire Swing,” “Big Rig”). At their best—like my dad’s childhood stories—Buffett’s songs are meandering, melancholic slices of life, recalling times and places that have faded into myth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The legends of country music, from Patsy Cline to Hank Williams, are rightly recognized for lionizing the struggles of rural Americans. But they’re also known for popularizing colloquial American English. And like theirs, Buffett’s songs are stuffed with mottos and adages; lines that border on cliché, yet remain essential parts of the American lexicon. Sayings like “talk is cheap,” “say what you mean and mean what you say,” and “no free rides” instantly evoke a classic American worldview—ways of life as much as turns of phrase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what connects Jimmy Buffett to country also sets him apart. Rather than simply mourning the past, his work confronts lost ways of life, showing how those lifestyles have always been—and always will be—precious and precarious. His songs aren’t just elegies for that “rural paradise lost,” but portraits of times and places that are always on their way out, no matter how hard we cling to them. Even in the late ‘70s, when he’d landed on the Caribbean-themed sound that carried him through the next two decades, there’s a sense of longing in his lyrics—an understanding that this too would pass, regardless of how well he sang about the good times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the same thing I hear in my dad’s voice when he reminisces about the Keys. Losing an outboard motor halfway to Cuba, throwing rocks at Hemingway’s house, hanging a shark from the gym rafters as a senior prank... There are things that cannot exist outside a particular time and place. But the lessons we draw from them transcend those limitations, while reminding us to appreciate every moment for what it is: something we’ll never get back, except through music and memory.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Much like Buffett, my dad has a mental phrasebook of folksy sayings, passed down through the generations. He, in turn, passed this “hick wisdom” on to me. Hardly a day goes by where I don’t consult it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of it is simple and universal. Phrases like “measure twice, cut once,” “locks are for honest people,” and “don’t shit where you eat” offer guidance for practically anyone. Others are more judgmental. But unfortunately, this world is full of people who are “tighter than a crab’s ass,” who “don’t know their ass from first base,” and who are “about as sharp as a marble.” Or, my personal favorite—and one that increasingly typifies the American psyche—people whose only creed is “<em>me first and fuck everybody else</em>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still others, as with some of Buffett’s lyrics, sound absurdly provincial: “like a one-eyed dog in a butcher’s shop,” or “can’t beat that with a stick,” or the long list of things that would “make your pecker fall off.” These phrases instill not only meaning, but feeling. They’re experience by proxy; not exactly knowledge, but that elusive “hick wisdom” that remains relevant, even as the ways of life that inspired it fade to obscurity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Consider “sharp as a marble.” An ironic inversion of “sharp as a tack,” the slight captures the dry, working-class sense of humor shared by those who actually grew up playing games like marbles and jacks. The root phrase—found in print as early as<a href=""https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015067512361&amp;seq=597&amp;q1=sharp+as+tacks"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> 1912</a>—is an Americanization of a much older saying. “Sharp as a needle” appears in 19<sup>th</sup> century retellings of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” and usages like “as a thorn” and “as vinegar” go back to a<a href=""https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A58161.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext&amp;ref=thestopgap.net"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> 1678 collection</a> of English proverbs. The latter appears to stem from Latin (“<em>aceto acrius</em>”), potentially placing its origins in antiquity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Idioms like these are endlessly circulated, repeated, and mangled as they pass from person to person. They pick up local color, lose it, gain it again, then become something else entirely. They’re reflections of both the individuals who utter them and the communities they come from—reminders of not just who we are, but how we came to be.</p>

<p>Jimmy Buffett grew up on the Gulf Coast, mostly in and around Mobile, Alabama. No doubt he picked up much of his hick wisdom the same way I did: from his seafaring family.</p>

<p class=""indented"">My paternal grandfather, Robert Neil Hewitt, was a Navy diver who lied about his age to enlist in the lead-up to World War II. A boxer, dancer, and military hard-ass prone to “prowling and growling” up and down Duval Street, he was the type of person many happily consign to history. But people are imperfect in every era. Today, his sayings sound almost esoteric in their simplicity. They speak to lives of struggle; of making due and getting by, despite the world’s indifference.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">One of these—handed down by my great-grandpa, a man who had to swear he wasn’t an anarchist on his two-page immigration papers—sticks with me for its no-nonsense, plain-spoken worldview. My dad would repeat it any time I was faced with a chore I didn’t like. Whether it was mowing the lawn, or washing dishes, or gathering firewood, he’d tell me that “you don’t gotta like it, you just gotta do it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hardly the stuff of poetry. In a “frictionless,” tech-first world that encourages us to “work smarter, not harder” while “living our best lives,” such an austere prescription seems backwards. Wrong, even. But it remains one of the clearest value statements I’ve ever heard, making as much sense to me now as when I first heard it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These sayings, and the simple, stoic guidance they offer, become invaluable when the world feels unstable. Facing new social norms, rising prices, and unforgiving public discourse, we need the storied sayings of those who came before us—from those who proved that it <em>is</em> possible to face adversity and come out stronger—to provide not just hope, but the discipline that turns hope into action. And sometimes, as Jimmy Buffett often reminded us, that requires a little levity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think this, more than any well-deserved reputation for debauchery, is what most endears Buffett’s fans to his music. His best songs aren’t just funny diversions, but stories of trouble in paradise. Especially during his “island years,” when he shopped at Salvation Army and sought shelter in the Monroe County Library, Buffett’s lyrics illustrate the struggles of poverty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In “The Great Filling Station Holdup,” two hapless criminals rob a gas station with a pellet gun. Thrilled with their haul of fifteen dollars and a jar of cashews, they immediately hit their local dive, only to be “roughed and cuffed” by the deputy sheriff. In “The Wino and I Know,” from 1974’s <em>Living and Dying in ¾ Time,</em> Buffett reflects on his hard-up New Orleans days, sharing the streets with the city’s homeless. And in “Tin Cup Chalice,” another love letter to Key West on <em>A1A</em>, he meditates on simple pleasures, the things you don’t need money to enjoy, that offer themselves up if you know where to look. Like Faulkner with a funny bone, Buffett made hay of whatever was at hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Growing up in a poor corner of Upstate New York, these themes spoke to me. My earliest memories come from a camper-trailer outside what would eventually become our home. We didn’t have much. But it was more than enough. The changing of the seasons—the crystal sheen of the first snow, the unfolding leaves of spring and summer, the fleeting colors of fall—were their own kind of paradise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that’s the point Jimmy was always trying to make: that poverty and paradise can coexist. Indeed, they must. For Buffett, paradise wasn’t a place as much as a way of navigating the world; wherever you looked, there it was. But like everything else in life, it could only last so long.</p>

<p>In July 2014, I went to a Jimmy Buffett concert with my dad. My uncle Mike, who’d been to one before, told us to be ready early. About five hours early; or an hour after they opened the gates. Late enough to dodge traffic, but not too late to miss the fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew Parrotheads—of which I’d consider my dad an honorary member—had a reputation for partying. But what I experienced that day at the Great Woods Amphitheater made the most ardent professional tailgaters look tame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were jello shots. There were keg stands. There were football games on real sand beaches, shipped in and dumped on the asphalt. There were wet t-shirt contests (including men and women). There were joints and bongs and blunts passed across a sea of Hawaiian shirts. And there were boat drinks. God, were there boat drinks: blended in oversized blenders, poured into kitschy disposable cups, shared with strangers and passersby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As far as parking lot parties go, it was one of the best I’ve ever attended. 20,000 people, gathered around a common cause. The atmosphere was joyous, cavalier, carefree—like a three-day music festival without the commitment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The five-hour pre-game has blurred Buffett’s actual performance into a hazy memory. But that’s to be expected. I do remember that he closed with “Margaritaville,” the song that birthed his lifestyle empire, spawning hotels, casinos, and a nation-wide restaurant chain. The song was also Buffett’s only Top Ten hit, peaking at number eight in 1977.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parrotheads live in Margaritaville. Or at least they vacation there—despite the fact that it’s not a real place. As Jimmy would say: it’s a state of mind, man. But his grandkids will probably thank him for manufacturing it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1996, academic Dawn S. Bowden asked a cohort of Parrotheads where <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249057487_Lookin%27_for_Margaritaville_Place_and_Imagination_in_Jimmy_Buffett%27s_Songs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the “real” Margaritaville</a> was. Responses ranged from the obvious (Key West) to the obsequious (“near Montserrat,” where Buffett recorded his 1979 album <em>Volcano</em>). However, nearly all the respondents were sure it was a place to “escape to,” or to “find yourself.” Yet, for me, this is a willful misinterpretation of his work. Indeed, the entire Parrothead lifestyle—which, being a shrewd businessman, Jimmy gladly sold to his fans—misses the point of even his most popular songs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take “Margaritaville.” Remembered as a holiday staple—complete with its own Parrothead call and response—his biggest hit is actually about someone using that “booze in the blender” to mask their regrets. It’s a portrait of “Keys Disease,” the apathy and dependence that afflicts people who flee to paradise, only to find themselves drifting, listless, lost at sea. Like so much of Buffett’s work, its lyrics clash with the sunny instrumentation, to the point where fans simply ignore the meaning behind them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is what writer Eric Pooley, in a <a href=""https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,988920-1,00.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">1998 profile</a> for <em>Time</em>, called Jimmy’s “devil’s bargain.” A clever, introspective singer-songwriter, doomed to entertain “frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South.” Twenty years later, recognizing his success in selling the island life to Midwestern baby boomers, the <em>New York Times</em> ran another piece on Buffett. Headlined “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/arts/jimmy-buffett-does-not-live-the-jimmy-buffett-lifestyle.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jimmy Buffett Does Not Live the Jimmy Buffett Lifestyle</a>,” it mostly covers the business nous that made him the world’s most unexpected billionaire. But it also draws attention to this contradiction at the heart of his fandom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To concert crowds, he was the master of ceremonies at an endless beach party. To those who listened, he was a pensive romantic who savored the transitory nature of life, even as it slipped past. In all their well-meaning revelry, Parrotheads have mistaken the ritual for the meaning of his music. Critics often made the same mistake, describing his work as tacky “island escapism.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For most people, that’s all it will ever be. But treating his songs as mere subtropical, escapist fantasies belies the truth he told in his lyrics. More than anything, they were about finding a home, about losing it, about returning to it again and again, even as times changed. His music wasn’t an escape from “real life,” but an attempt to return to it, away from modern demands that value work more than happiness. He sang sometimes solemn, sometimes jovial appreciations of time’s passage, and the constant struggle to find our place in it.</p>

<p>Last year, my dad had cancerous lesions removed from his jaw, his neck, his back, his arms and his legs. The worst of these took a lymph node—and a sizable chunk of skin—from just below his ear. The doctors prescribed topical chemo creams, to be liberally daubed over his forearms and shins.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the brief moment when my dad and Jimmy Buffett shared the Keys, people were more likely to slather themselves in oil than sunscreen. And in that era before widespread air conditioning, island life mostly took place under the sun. Now, the consequences of all that exposure seems obvious. But back then—especially for those who lived and worked on the sea—it was just part of the deal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Jimmy died on September 1<sup>st</sup>, due to complications from a rare form of skin cancer, it was like losing a part of my dad. But it was also a reminder of what makes Buffett’s music unique.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a year when country music seems resurgent, Buffett’s departure from the genre that inspired him is more apparent than ever. Whereas he saw bittersweet beauty in lost ways of life, modern country tries to claw them back. Chart-topping hits like “Try That in a Small Town” and “Rich Men North of Richmond” peddle self-righteous grievance in lieu of stoic struggle, yearning for an impossible return to an idealized past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These songs—and the lifestyles they alternately mourn and espouse—speak to a growing number of Americans. People crave the “authentic” ways of life that country musicians (and Buffett) have always swooned over. But these songs lack the wisdom—the hick wisdom that ought to be country music’s purview—to face life’s complexities, to find simplicity where they can, and to accept that nothing stays the same forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy was lucky to inherit that wisdom from his family. So was I. My dad—who was fortunate enough to come of age in a Caribbean community masquerading as a military town, then unfortunate enough to lose it—has always understood its importance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not that understanding makes it easier. Losing a way of life will always be painful. Once lost, the people and places that defined it are gone. All we can do is remember them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Buffett’s father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 1995, he wrote a song (<em>Banana Wind</em>’s “False Echoes”) to commemorate his life. As so often happens with artists and their art, the personal ended up revealing the universal. The song’s chorus, which repeats the line “time ain’t for saving, no, time’s not for that,” illustrates Buffett’s true philosophy, divorced from his stage persona. A heart-rending ballad, “False Echoes” was never performed live.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy Buffett never gave himself enough credit. Like his critics, he often referred to his work as “pure escapism.” But his lyrics went deeper than that, in the same way that my dad’s folksy maxims are more than just silly sayings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth is, Buffett saw his life and work for what it was: a brief swell in an ocean of change. His songs acknowledge that nothing more reliably threatens a way of life than time itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy’s passing—and the specter of my own father’s mortality—was, in some ways, his final act. A culmination of the themes he spent his life exploring. His death brought me back to my childhood, to my grandpa’s Airstream by the canal, to times and places I can’t get back, not just because that’s when I first heard Jimmy’s music, but because that’s the message he (and my dad) passed down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents are products and reminders of lost ways of life. Our islands are our personal histories. They’re our stories and sayings—hand-me-down tales not about striving, but merely surviving. They stay with us in our songs, in the adages we lean on when times get tough, and in our collective dreams of a lost paradise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jimmy didn’t just grieve the past. He showed us how it became the present. By only looking back, we lose those fleeting moments that are the only time we truly have. Sometimes, it takes someone singing about cheeseburgers and margaritas to help you realize that.</p>

2940,"January 1-6","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">As a loyal <em>Dispatches</em> fan throughout its four-issue existence, I'm honored to share this small taste of what awaits readers of my new book, <strong>Dear California: The Golden State in Diaries and Letters</strong>. It tries to tell the story of our state through correspondence, journals and other occasional writings never originally intended for publication. The catch: I've organized <strong>Dear California</strong> calendrically, in chronological order <em>day by day</em>, instead of year by year.<br>
<br>
For example, on New Years' Day alone, we see the Donner Party freezing to death at one end of the state while Commodore Stockton sews up the Mexican-American War at the other. On the same date in 1969, a doomed young GI writes home from Camp Pendleton. Two years later, his president complains to H.R. Haldeman about the Stanford football captain posing for pictures with topless dancers. These juxtapositions create a kind of flipbook effect, collapsing the centuries as patterns emerge and recur across time and place.<br>
<br>
My previous book, <em>Dear Los Angeles</em>, attempted to pull off the same trick for L.A. Now, modestly, I think of <strong>Dear California</strong> as my <em>Ulysses</em>: The protagonist of the earlier book has returned as a supporting character in a more ambitious sequel. And if you think James Joyce has no place in a book about California, by all means pick up a copy and check out the third entry for May 4....<br>

Even though it was not serious, it wasn’t without consequences, for the car passed over him and dragged him a good stretch.

<p>The present fascination of Carmel owes much to the presence of Robinson Jeffers... His Carmel “retreat” is now a thing of the past.

Los Angeles “realtors” are already at Cambria, a few miles down the coast, and are even now gazing on Carmel like the lady feasting her eyes on the Roan Stallion. It is unforgettable. Carmel has become a splendid experience in the lives of many western artists and they will view its desecration with unspeakable horror.</p>

<p>The method which the fathers observe in the conversion is not to oblige anyone to become a Christian, admitting only those who voluntarily offer themselves, and this they do in the following manner: Since these Indians are accustomed to live in the fields and the hills like beasts, the fathers require that if they wish to be Christians they shall no longer go to the forest, but must live in the mission, and if they leave the Ranchería, as they call the little village of huts and houses of the Indians, they will go to seek them and will punish them. With this they begin to catechize the heathen who voluntarily come, teaching them to make the sign of the cross and other things necessary, and if they persevere in the catechism for two or three months and in the same frame of mind, when they are instructed they proceed to baptise them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If any Indian wishes to go to the mountain to see his relatives or to hunt acorns, they give him permission for a specified number of days. As a rule they do not fail to return, and sometimes they come bringing some heathen relative, who remains for the catechism, either through the example of the others or attracted by the pozole, which they like better than their herbs and the foods of the mountain; and so these Indians are usually caught by the mouth.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><em>Dear Miss Manners,</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last April you very kindly agreed to be my etiquette consultant. I need your advice rather urgently. To explain: I’ve just got a FAX machine, and have been sending out lots of letters on it. One of my sisters in England also has FAX (much to my amazement) so naturally I sent her one straight away. I was surprised that she didn’t answer by return—hers came the next day. However, she did say that she was in London when mine arrived, hence delay. Which brings me to the point: What is an answer “by return” in the case of FAX?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a letter, it’s simple; one should answer if possible by return of post. From California, where I live, to England letters take a minimum of 4 days, often much longer, so one is fairly safe in allowing a week or so before answering. One has had it dinned into one since childhood that if you get a letter from somebody, you should answer within a week—or max. two weeks. Anything later requires an apology, or rather an excuse even if untrue (“awfully sorry for late answer—I just got back from Alaska/Timbuctoo/etc,” depending on lateness).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With FAX, should one answer within the hour? Or even 15 minutes, given the speediness of transmittal?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps every new technology requires some re-thinking of the correct response. For example, telegrams (which you are probably too young to remember) almost always had bad news; as they were jolly expensive, the answer was simple, such as “Desperately sorry. Mitford,” only 3 words. Or if it was just a broken limb, not a death: “Rotten luck. Mitford.” Again, only 3 words; ample, at a shilling a word.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eagerly awaiting your response. It’s now about 1:30 p.m., Wednesday. I’m sitting by my FAX machine.</p>

<p><strong>IN 1928-1930 THE MEXICAN WRITER </strong>and political activist<strong> </strong>José<strong> </strong>Vasconcelos campaigned for the presidency of Mexico, drawing on support from the Californian and Southwestern regions. During the early twentieth century, Vasconcelos played an enormous role in the culture and politics of Mexico. Indeed, during the 1920s, as member of General Alvaro Obregón’s administration, Vasconcelos served as rector of the National University of Mexico and the first head of a new department of public education where he acted as patron to the giants of the Mexican <em>muralista</em> movement: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Although he lost in what was clearly a rigged election, Vasconcelos’ campaign did yield one important benign feature worth recording: For it was precisely at that juncture in his political and philosophical career that he spoke most receptively of the Mesoamerican deity and culture hero Quetzalcóatl.</p>

<p>Championing Quetzalcóatl as “the first educator of this zone of the world” (“el primer educador de esta zona del mundo”), Vasconcelos held that his hero Francisco Madero, the man who had helped initiate the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and paid for it with his life, had proclaimed “the new incarnation of Quetzalcóatl” with Vasconcelos himself emerging as a kind of Quetzalcóatl prophet: “un Quetzalcóatl moderno.” Contrasting the two critical Mesoamerican culture heroes Quetzalcóatl and Huitzilopochtli, the former representing “civilization” while the latter stood for the “barbarism” of the Aztec past, Vasconcelos championed Quetzalcóatl, lamenting that the 1929 proponents of Huitzilpochtli—Vasconcelos’ opponents—had overcome Quetzalcóatl, “the god of pre-Aztec civilization” (“el dios de la civilización preazteca”).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the Vasconcelos of the 1920s had ascended to becoming Publicist, indeed Prophet, of Quetzalcóatl, it was not a fascination confined to Mexican or Mesoamerican thinkers. In the 1880s Friedrich Nietzsche had even fantasized about moving to Oaxaca in search of a landscape appropriate for thinking “beyond good and evil” than the Tyrol. Even D.H. Lawrence, searching desperately for cultic religious encouragements in Mexico in 1923-1925, succumbed to similar adulation after encountering the great temple of Quetzalcóatl in Teotihuacán. Once settled in the village of Chapala, Jalisco in 1923, Lawrence launched a novel he called <em>Quetzalcoatl</em> and then rewrote it in Oaxaca with the new publisher-approved title <em>The Plumed Serpent</em>, published in 1926. That novel revealed Lawrence at his most prophetic, as he envisaged the coming of a Mexican redeemer Don Ramón to reinstitute the cult and worship of Quetzalcóatl. Although critics were not generally drawn to Lawrentian poetics of a “dark” god arising from the mestizos of Mexico, he himself averred that “my Quetzalcoatl novel lies nearer my heart than any other work of mine.” Interestingly, Lawrence almost had lunch with José Vasconcelos on 26 April 1923, an occasion that Vasconcelos had to delay by one day due to other state matters but which sufficiently irked Lawrence to drop the idea. Nonetheless, according to Lawrence’s biographer Harry Moore, for his fictional character Don Ramón Lawrence “apparently had to borrow aspects of the career and personality of José Vasconcelos, whom he disliked.” This Vasconcelos, Moore adds, should be pictured at the time as the “Secretary on Horseback” for busily transporting the pedagogical tools of “culture”—including copies of <em>The Iliad—</em>deep into the indigenous hinterland.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More recently, such lingering affection for Quetzalcóatl has popped up within the ranks of the California New Age. Under the guidance of author José Argüelles, attempts to revive Mayan religiosity through a modernist vocabulary have led to Argüelles’ own schematically designed tributes to Quetzalcóatl as, in effect, the key to all History. Originally inspired by W. B. Yeats’ <em>A Vision</em> (the vision itself originating apparently as Yeats traveled from San Bernardino to Los Angeles in 1919), Argüelles subsequently associated with Terence McKenna’s attachment to the importance of the <em>I Ching</em> to promote the event of the Harmonic Convergence of August 16-17, 1987, confirming, according to Argüelles’ biographer Stephanie South, “the prophecy of Quetzalcóatl” that Argüelles had presumably received in 1964 under the influence of D. H. Lawrence’s <em>The Plumed Serpent</em>. This eventually produced the prediction of a Cosmic turning point based on the Mayan Calendar dated December 21, 2012, and, in time, Argüelles followed Lawrence’s Don Ramón by reinventing himself as the Mayanist prophet Valum Votan.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Thankfully Mesoamerican scholarship has worked patiently toward more balanced, if still debated, approaches to the pivotal god and culture hero of Mesoamerica. Despite Lawrence’s “dark” Aztec candidate prone to violence and human sacrifice, the influence of Quetzalcóatl (“plumed” or “feathered serpent”) over the larger physical range and temporality of&nbsp; Mesoamerican urban and city-state history easily precedes Lawrence’s Aztec version. For anthropologist Davíd Carrasco, Quetzalcóatl is the overarching symbol of Mesoamerican culture creation, the ultimate patron of the urban city-state as “a cosmo-magical construct.” Legend, tradition, and written sources collectively celebrate Quetzalcóatl as the bringer of human life, fertility (corn, pulque), wind god, culture hero, divine patron of priesthood, votary of peace and opponent of human sacrifice in his manifestation as Venus, both the morning and evening star. Indeed, Quetzalcóatl “establishes the fifth age” that the Aztecs later sponsored; he even “knows” when this “new age will dawn in the east.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the larger history of Mesoamerica, Teotihuacán served as the expansive center of the Quetzalcóatl cult and religion during its major period of prosperity c. 200-700 CE. The magnificent Quetzalcóatl pyramid at the very heart of Teotihuacán even “marked the center of the city.” Celebrating its Quetzalcóatl cult, Teotihuacán went on to influence and shape other such major urban centers as Xochicalco, the lowland Mayan cities, and especially Tula/Tollan. The latter’s celebration in particular of “the patronage of the great divine being, Quetzalcoatl” set the future standard for schools of Aztec culture chorusing: “Truly with him it began, truly from him it flowed out, from Quetzalcoatl—all art and knowledge,” as cited by Carrasco. In turn Aztec culture has become a central symbol for Chicano sensibility through the latter’s exploitation of the theme of “Aztlán”—the presumed southwest source of the Aztec peoples—as the Aztec and Chicano place of origin: “many Mexican-Americans … have embraced the symbol of Aztlan to express something integral to being Chicano.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most important for Californian self-identity is the Teotihuacán influence on the city-state of Monte Albán towering over the Oaxacan valley. The “immense, <em>theatrical</em> concept of religious space and action” characterizing Teotihuacán’s overall design is traceable in the urban plans forming the Monte Albán complex proper, thus importing the Quetzalcóatl cult with its close association to Cocijo—the Zapotec deity of wind, water and clouds—into functioning as “a universalizing ideology.” Indeed, given Monte Albán’s general founding date of 500 BCE, it turns out that a respectable number of Mesoamerican experts, including Richard Blanton, would “award Monte Albán the distinction of being, arguably, both the <em>first</em> and <em>fastest growing</em> urban development in Mesoamerican history,” “Mesoamerica’s <em>first city-state</em>.” In fact these two centers differed in substantial ways, since Monte Albán, unlike Teotihuacán, made up an isolated site that did not work well for farming or regional markets. From this difference Blanton has inferred that Monte Albán must have been therefore deliberately conceived as a center of “very self-conscious and highly disciplined neutrality”—in effect a “disembedded capital.” Ultimately Blanton finds Monte Albán as “a site of religious neutrality and multi-ethnic tolerance,” his account intentionally underplaying or ignoring the usual focus on unificatory religiosity or a “sacred mountain.”</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Whatever the final success to Blanton’s particular reading of the origins and purposes behind Monte Albán, at no point does it lapse its claims on behalf of the foundational role of Oaxaca for Mesoamerican culture and politics. This perspective corresponds to Miguel Covarrubias’s conjecture that Oaxaca’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec might well have been “the strategic center … where man first evolved <em>on the American continent</em> from a nomadic barbarian into a highly civilized sedentary agriculturist.” Indeed, unlike the Central Mexican plateau on which Teotihuacán and its imitators are located, Oaxaca belongs climatically to the montane cloud forest stretching to western Panama where the fabled “resplendent” quetzal bird is to be found.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As a plausible foundation for Mesoamerican civilization in general, the Oaxacan city-state of Monte Albán—possibly the <em>first</em> in Mesoamerica, together with its multifaceted “visions” for <em>Quetzal</em>–cóatl—might serve as inspiration for a California <em>(las Californias</em>) committed to founding José Vasconcelos’ ideal of a Cosmic Race<em>. </em>Any celebration of California should begin with acknowledgment of its legendary origins out of Oaxaca. In 1535 the conquistador Hernán Cortés, then Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca, sent out squadrons from the Oaxacan sea site Playa la Ventosa in his search for direct access to the ocean and the teeming Orient. On May 3 his crew landed on the peninsula of Baja California and baptized it “California”—probably drawing on the fifth book <em>Sergas de Esplandián</em> of the series <em>Amadís de Gaula</em> composed by the Casitilian <em>regidor</em> Garcí Rodríquez de Montalvo in 1510. It was that book which first publicized the tale of an Isle of California ruled by the beautiful Black Amazon queen Calafía along with her warrior maidens, located—appropriately—“at the very side of the terrestrial paradise.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a vision that might well encourage Californians to carry forth in their lives and culture this original Oaxacan legacy of housing the first true Mesoamerican city-state conjoined to the ecumenical standard of the Mesoamerican culture hero Quetzalcóatl.</p>

3008,"Almost Too Much Calm","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>VINCENT VAN GOGH WAS CERTAINLY NOT</strong> putting himself out to pasture when he left the psychiatric hospital at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the spring of 1890 and moved to bucolic Auvers-sur-Oise, 19 miles north-west of Paris. During the last 70 days of his life, all spent around Auvers, save for a short visit to see his brother in Paris in early July, he produced 74 paintings and 33 drawings. This rapid pace of work culminated, it’s said, in <em>Tree Roots</em>, completed on July 27, 1890, the day he shot himself in the chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Tree Roots</em>, along with dozens of paintings, etchings, and drawings in ""Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: The Final Months,"" is now hanging at the Musée d’Orsay, part of a two-stop show that began in Amsterdam at the Van Gogh Museum and now garners up to two hour waits to gain entry in Paris. Together, the works create an unexpected sense of calm that sits uneasily, and revealingly, alongside all the associations of crisis and tortured passion that are normally placed on Vincent van Gogh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cat scampering across <em>Daubigny’s Garden</em> and the inviting rowboats in <em>Bank of the Oise at Auvers</em> seem a world apart from <em>Sorrowing Old Man</em> and <em>The Prison Courtyard</em>, completed just months before the end of his hospital stay in the south of France. His last paintings evoke the feeling of an artist standing still in nature, drinking in lush landscapes and winding country lanes after a difficult period searching for inspiration in grim etchings and old sketches. It’s these glimpses of a fragile, temporary serenity that make his decision to end his life in Auvers sting all the more—the evidence in a way that he was ready to find peace.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">There is a simplicity, even a mundanity, to the way the show is laid out that inflects its dramatic billing. The curators decided to group most of the 50 or so paintings thematically, by familiar subjects: village scenes; flower studies; portraits; and landscapes. After multiple mentions in the exhibit’s introductory rooms, van Gogh’s death recedes from view. What reasserts itself instead is a modern artist attempting to forge ahead with diligent and pleasing experiments in color and composition, as in the dynamic impasto patterning of <em>Houses at Auvers</em> loaned from Boston, the tapestry-like abstraction of <em>Ears of Wheat</em> from Amsterdam, or the expressionist-precursor <em>Portrait of a Young Woman</em> from Otterloo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This thematic organization reveals quiet signs of the alienation Van Gogh was experiencing at the time. His farmlands are missing farmers but his <em>Sheaves of Wheat</em> is an unmistakable vision of slow-dancing lovers. And despite identifying portraiture as “the only thing in painting that [moved him] to the greatest extent,” van Gogh continued to struggle to find willing sitters. The few portraits here, like those of Adeline Ravoux, his innkeeper’s daughter in Auvers, share a striking stiffness and a tendency for the subject to be oriented away from the viewer, staring far off into the distance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {""ids"":[3017],""linkTo"":""none""} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped""><ul class=""blocks-gallery-grid""><li class=""blocks-gallery-item""><figure><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1767422001.jpeg"" alt="""" data-id=""3017"" data-full-url=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1767422001.jpeg"" data-link=""https://dispatchesmag.com/?attachment_id=3017"" class=""wp-image-3017""/><figcaption class=""blocks-gallery-item__caption"">Sheaves of Wheat, 1890.

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">An exception is the Orsay’s famous portrait of Auvers resident, amateur artist, and homeopath Doctor Paul Gachet, whose experience in psychiatry and friendship with the Impressionists were chief reasons Theo van Gogh advised his brother to head to the banks of the Oise. Van Gogh painted his new doctor friend as a woozy personification of melancholy, and with an intimacy uncommon among all the human figures depicted in his Auvers paintings. His portrait can also be seen as a visual diagnosis of Gachet to match the written one he sent to Theo on 10 July 1890: “First of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just as much…Now when one blind man leads another blind man, don't they both fall into the ditch?” Hence a figure in Auvers that van Gogh could face head on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Occasionally, the exhibit organizes itself formally in groupings of etchings, drawings, and, most astonishingly, 11 of the 13 long rectangular “double square” format canvases that van Gogh completed in Auvers. The critic and novelist Joris-Karl Huysmans wrote in 1879 that “the beauty of a landscape is above all made of melancholy.” With works by two of van Gogh’s northstars Millet and Ruisdael in mind, Huysmans noted the rarity of “great landscape painters who make you feel cheerful and carefree in front of their canvases.” This clearly rings true for the easy standouts <em>The Plain of Auvers</em>, <em>Wheatfield with Crows</em> and <em>Wheatfield under Thunderclouds</em>, but it’s a particular eye-of-the-storm quietude that unsettles in these frieze-like canvases. There’s even an argument to be made that van Gogh effectively ended painting’s landscape genre with these last works, so totally do they unify a physical and emotional perspective.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Louis van Tilborgh details in his catalog essay for the show how it was a quiet resignation that preceded van Gogh’s fatal suicide attempt. In mid-July, he wrote to his sister and mother of being “wholly in a mood of almost too much calm,” while four days before the gunshot, he wrote to Theo of a “pointlessness” in his continuing to write in great detail from Auvers: “the desire has passed to such a degree.” Whatever his thinking as he painted his last landscapes, their long and narrow format and high horizon lines suggest a compressing, bunker-like point of view. It could have even been a reaction against these exercises in distant observation that brought him a brush-length away from the land in his final painting <em>Tree Roots</em>—and finally closer still.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>SINCE THE MASSACRES OF THAT SHABBAT MORNING</strong>, October 7, 2023, there has been a lot of talk on Israeli airwaves about the breakdown of the nation’s conception—<em>konseptsya</em>—of how to conduct its conflict with Gaza’s ruthlessly totalitarian rulers. The idea that Hamas, as an organization and militant group, could be contained by economic incentives was shattered and revealed to be not only a sham but a self-propagated delusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What struck me in those early hours of Shabbat, after hearing sirens at 8:15 AM and running with my wife and three little girls to what we hoped was the safest spot in our house—built in 1932 at a time when safe rooms were not standard—was that Hamas had achieved one of the most sophisticated deception campaigns of our time using a simple, time-tested method. They used the primary character weakness of the person who has led our country for the past generation against him: corruption. They fooled him into thinking that they were more interested in maintaining power over their society than in jihad against Israel. And he believed them because this is precisely what he has done—maintain power—and continues to even now as our nation is at war.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that war is afoot and over three hundred thousand reservists have been called up, leaving families behind, we hear another refrain on Israeli airwaves: First we fight, and later we ask the questions that need to be asked. This <em>konseptsya</em> has not yet broken down. But it must—for the simple reason that, at war, you identify all your enemies, and if one of them is an internal foe, then you single him out and treat him as one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the first second the terrorists broke down Israel’s defenses and swarmed into its territory, the fighters have been its people. Soldiers, military commanders, members of the police, even civilians—they jumped into battle and, despite fighting selflessly, were overwhelmed by a force that was simply unforeseen. Many people are already saying that those whose job it is to prevent such surprises have failed. But individuals are fallible. What keeps us safe are our systems, organizations, institutions. No matter how many intelligence successes we may have achieved, when our national bodies are corrupted from within, weaknesses appear that, when identified, can be exploited. Israel has undertaken endless rounds of negotiations with Hamas, from ceasefires to prisoner exchanges, and when a single person is responsible for all of the decisions being made it becomes easier to learn how he thinks. When he comes under increasing political pressure, spending more of his time rushing to achieve his last major political achievement at any price—a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia—with the entire country suffering from a social civil war threatening to turn into a violent struggle at any moment, his thinking patterns become even easier to exploit. He cannot think creatively about the reality that is unfolding around him because too much of his time is devoted to struggles that, while they may not be urgent in themselves, are key to keeping his grip on power. A person whose focus is power loses perspective on reality, because power, by nature, is limited, and any attempt to maintain it necessarily distorts reality itself.</p>

<p>I am speaking, obviously, of Benjamin Netanyahu—the leader who brought our society to its knees throughout 2023, and who, even in our most dire moment in generations, negotiated over the terms of a unity government in an attempt to hold onto power when the war ends. This one person who likely believes that he has devoted his life to the good of our nation and its people, who has tried to strengthen Israel regionally at the cost of weakening its national institutions, has caused the most societal damage Israel has ever seen. The only principle he touted that resonated with everyone’s existential concerns—security—turned out to be a lie.

<p>This kind of person needs to be identified as an enemy. Everyone, from talking heads on television to close friends alike, have repeated the old <em>konseptsya</em> that this is not the time to be critical. That the time for inquiry comes later, after victory. They say that ""Bibi,"" as he is called in Israel, will face responsibility when the time comes. But I have my doubts. Trauma and shock tend to produce surprises. Bibi, who is a master of manipulation, will hang everyone out to dry before taking responsibility for what has happened to our people.  </p>

<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is a smart person. But he made the mistake of believing that smart people cannot be outsmarted. Now we have to make sure we don’t make the same mistake. Bibi cannot be ousted as Prime Minister with a push of a button—the bottom line is that we still depend on him as our head of state—but he can be ostracized from within and made to understand that, while we have no choice but to count on our political leaders for survival, we see him as one of the antagonists in this story. There is fear that a second front will open up in the country’s north and that Hezbollah will enter fully into the war, which would bring indescribable destruction both to us and to Lebanon. This fear is justified and everything should be done to avoid such a development. But there should be no fear about opening a second front within, which looks squarely at our reality and refuses to accept Bibi’s betrayal of our people.</p>

<p>As I listened to news of people trapped in bomb shelters with terrorists shooting at them, calling out for help and begging for the police, the army, the state—anyone—to come and help them, I realized it was the same call we heard in May 2021, when armed riots broke out in Israeli cities between Arab and Jewish residents, and the police was nowhere to be found. It’s not that individual members of the police or army weren’t on the scene—it’s that the state’s institutions had been hollowed out. The lack of a single person's personal integrity, in power for so many years, had rippled as far as the security establishment itself. We saw this over two years ago. But we couldn’t have fathomed the depth of its implications on our society.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need unity. We have to resist factionalism. But our faith lies with the people—the many tens of thousands who did not wait to be called up for reserve duty and hitched rides down to centers where they are being trained and briefed. The people setting up donation tents to get necessary supplies down to those hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have left their friends and families, the volunteers baking gluten-free bread for celiac soldiers, the kindergarten teachers making house calls to give housebound children a sense of security. People who helped each other survive the attacks. These are our heroes. They are the ones who, once we are able to fend off our enemies without, will have to ensure we can fend off the political threat of our enemies within.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph""><em>Editor's Note: As part of the WPA, the Federal Arts Project was terminated in 1943, after several years in which its range and funding had languished. Mostly between 1935 and 1939, the artists of the FAP created 108,099 easel paintings and 17,774 pieces of
sculpture. In New York and elsewhere, a selection of these works was exhibited in museums, community centers, art galleries, union halls, and, most often schools, in connection with the project’s art education programs. As the project was wound down and closed down during the war, the vast majority of the artworks were warehoused and subsequently discarded—auctioned off as junk or simply scrapped. The documentation of their “allocation” was lost. For more on the history and
significance of the WPA /FAP, see Bram Dijkstra, American Expressionism: Art and Social Change l920-1950 (2003); included is an illuminating reference to a story in Life magazine, April 17, 1944, headlined “End of WPA Art: Canvases which cost government $35,000,000 are sold for junk,” and reflective of Life’s prejudice that the New Deal arts projects had been a boondoggle; it is now available online. Other accounts of the project can be found in Francis V. O’Connor, Federal Support for the Visual Arts: The New Deal and Now (1969), Robert D. McKinzie, The New Deal for Artists (1973), Andrew Hemingway, Artists on the Left: American Artists and the Communist Movement, 1926-1956; Robert G. Kennedy, When Art: The New Deal, Art, and Democracy (2009). McKinzie also provides a
concise account of the Federal Art Project in Franklin D. Roosevelt: His Life and Times: An Encyclopedic View, ed. Otis L. Graham, Jr. and Meghan Robinson Wander (1985).</em></p>

<p><strong>IN LISTS</strong> <strong>OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL</strong> American artists of the past century—Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Georgia O’Keeffe, etc.—one name is sure to be missing: George Biddle. For exercising perhaps the most widespread (if improbable) impact on American art during a critical moment in its history, he should be equally renowned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A member of the esteemed Biddle family of Philadelphia, George Biddle attended the Groton school in Massachusetts before graduating from Harvard Law School in 1911, after which he abruptly pivoted to fine art. Fueled by passion for his newfound calling and supported by his family’s wealth, he received formal training abroad in Paris and back home in Pennsylvania. After enlisting in the United States Army during the First World War, Biddle then embarked on a meandering grand tour through Spain, France, Tahiti, and elsewhere, copying the old masters and trying on various stylistic hats wherever he went. A sketching trip through Mexico in 1928, alongside the famed muralist and communist Diego Rivera, proved particularly instructive. Rivera’s integration of artistic and social ambitions through large scale mural paintings sparked a similar desire in Biddle, who likewise sought to synthesize his artistic pursuits, legal training, and public service. When he returned home, he dedicated himself to public murals and lithography, alongside oil painting, in an effort to produce art of broader social purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Biddle’s travels and social conscience appear hand in hand with his creative output. Tenderly rendered depictions of villagers in India, destitute American migrants, beggars in Mexico, and American soldiers on the front lines collectively attest to his civic responsibility, artistic development, and extensive resources. Yet, Biddle might have worked in obscurity if not for his connections. As fate would have it, Biddle’s childhood friend at Groton was a boy by the name of Franklin  Roosevelt, who was elected president not long after Biddle wrapped up his time alongside Rivera. Inspired by the ideas connecting labor and art that he developed on his travels in Mexico, and having heard of plans for a so-called “New Deal” in the United States, Biddle wrote his longtime friend and now-president a letter, suggesting that some help for artists be provided in the form of government sponsored commissions. More precisely, artists could be employed to “capture America,” in ways reminiscent of Biddle’s own artistic ambitions, using their talents to adorn public spaces and buildings as had already been done successfully in other countries. Roosevelt agreed, and the rest is history.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The format of the resulting government program, under the umbrella of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Federal Art Project (FAP), belies the immense impact it had on the lives of artists throughout the United States. At the peak of the program, 10,000 artists received guaranteed income in exchange for completed artworks or time spent on public commissions. This resulted in approximately 100,000 easel paintings, 2,500 murals, 18,000 sculptures, 300,000 prints, and an immeasurable number of craft objects and posters from the federal government’s $35,000,000 investment (translating to $770,000,000 in today’s money). With that kind of public investment in the arts, it’s no wonder New York City, home to countless former WPA/FAP artists (Pollock included), soon became the epicenter of an increasingly global art community in the 1940s. Yet perhaps more significant than the overall impact on the art world—and certainly more overlooked—is the influence the program had on the lives of America’s perennially disregarded creative community: immigrants, women, Black artists, and others who were now seen by the government as essential workers serving a significant civic purpose and deserving of guaranteed income in exchange for their creative labor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In today’s world, it is all too easy to romanticize these interwar programs as an alternative, more inclusive model of artistic production outside the hegemony of the commercial market. It is also easy to dismiss the art funded by these programs as naive, propagandistic, and sometimes overly illustrative of “American ideals” à la Norman Rockwell. Though neither view is entirely false, the reality is more complex. Review panels, public comment, and administrative procedures no doubt influenced the content of the large-scale murals and public sculpture produced under these programs. However, the easel paintings and smaller-scale sculptures&nbsp;sponsored by the WPA/FAP eluded much of the bureaucratic red tape; they could simply be rejected for public display. Arguably, the smaller-scale works produced under these programs more readily attest to the uncensored feelings of their creators, tasked as they were with capturing a nation amid the dust bowl, the Great Depression, and two world wars.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">That certainly seems to be the case in <em><a href=""https://huntington.org/exhibition/art-people-wpa-era-paintings-dijkstra-collection"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Art for the People: WPA Era Paintings from the Dijkstra Collection</a></em>, a refreshingly diverse exhibition of tender, emotionally wrought, and sometimes nightmarish oil paintings and sculptures produced in the United States between the 1920s and ‘40s, now on display at the Huntington Library in San Marino. Intimate in scope and drawn entirely from the private collection of Sandra and Bram Dijkstra, the show proposes a reevaluation of this often overlooked period of American art, all too often dismissed as a precursor to the innovations of Abstract Expressionism or a historical aside to F.D.R.’s New Deal. In contrast, <em>Art for the People</em> showcases a unique period in American art history where the typical relations between artists, patrons, and civic responsibility were momentarily altered in ways seemingly impossible to imagine today. To paraphrase Lincoln, to see this exhibition is to experience an art <em>of and by</em> the people, not just for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Art for the People</em> proves timely in other ways. In many of the paintings, vivid psychological landscapes of gnarled hillsides, leafless trees, barren industrial wastelands, and gray skies—under which forlorn, isolated figures toil or ponder the changes around them—speak to today’s climate emergency, social inequality, and so-called “deaths of despair.” Take Fletcher Martin’s <em>Migrant Woman </em>(1938), wherein a woman sits on the ground along a riverbank, cradling her head with an elbow on her knee. Though the figure is still, her eyes and facial features are blurred and the fabric of her dress below the knees is marked with mud, mirroring the empty landscape around her and suggesting the toil of a long day. With a desaturated palette and loose brushwork, Martin captures a moment of recognition, introspection, anxiety, and grief, where migrant fantasies of the “American Dream” met political, social, and economic realities in a nation often hostile to their presence. The universality of Martin’s image—mirroring those coming out of today’s curbside migrant camps in New York City and refugee camps in Gaza—owes much to his restraint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other paintings, similarly isolated figures appear even more deprived and contorted, likewise faceless or turned away, often missing clothing, and sometimes buried in the earth. In Anton Refregier’s <em>Plowed Under</em> (1936), an otherwise pastoral landscape becomes a vortex of human suffering. Bent trees and pierced farmhouses twist around a large pit in the bottom half of the canvas, where a barefooted figure in overalls lies in cover, or death, amidst broken boards, discarded wheels, and other debris. Simultaneously depicting a bomb crater, grave, or trench, the painting could manifest as a harbinger of horrors to come or a final resting place in an otherwise destroyed world.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Landscapes like these make up the bulk of <em>Art for the People</em>, attesting as much to the show’s curation and the Dijkstra’s collection as to the social atmosphere of interwar America. Yet the common format never feels overwhelmingly thematic, and it makes the stylistic differences between artists more apparent. Nowhere does this strategy seem more intentional than in Arnold Blanch’s <em>Rondout Creek</em> (1932) and Earle Loran’s <em>San Francisco Docks with Alcatraz Island</em> (1940), both of which present industrialized waterfront landscapes along the east and west coasts. Hung side by side at the show’s earlier exhibition at the Oceanside Museum of Art, the paintings respectively highlight the changing landscapes and artistic developments of opposite ends of the United States. Blanch depicts a riverside factory complex where the only signs of life are gray plumes of exhaust, under which crumbling masonry walls, curved railroad tracks, and a dirty gray-blue sky are rendered with dabbled brushwork and a muted palette. Loran’s urban landscape is likewise devoid of people—save for a few cars, a cargo ship, and a Matissean nude on a billboard in the foreground—yet it is rendered in a much more graphic if vibrant style, abounding with green and red gables echoing the rocky coast of Alcatraz and the hilly San Francisco Bay beyond.</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Despite the commonalities and differences, the most surprising works in the show break away from these psychological and politically charged landscapes, appearing to stem from more personal and quotidian experiences. Images of a naked woman inspecting her toenails in a bathroom, a girl in a red sweater sitting on a chair, and a vase of pink peonies on a kitchen table more directly attest to the lives of their creators through the intimacy of their subject matter. At the very least, they offer respite from the show’s bleak depictions of interwar America.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most powerful works in the exhibition appear to circumvent both trends. Case in point is <em>Soldier</em>, painted by Charles White in 1944 right after he was drafted into the US Army at age 26. With its subject looking upward, clutching a rifle like a security blanket against an ominous sky and placeless landscape, <em>Soldier </em>is a far cry from popular depictions of wartime camaraderie and heroism. By contrast, White’s painting attests to war’s loneliness, particularly for a Black man serving in a segregated military for a nation yet to experience the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s. Adding to the drama is White’s ability to incorporate a wide range of reds, blues, yellows, and greens into all aspects of the painting through long, linear strokes, imbuing <em>Soldier</em> with a disorienting effect when viewed up close.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Here and throughout <em>Art for the People</em>, nothing about the WPA/FAP’s simple prompt for artists to “capture America'' seems to anticipate the power and range of the resulting artworks. The paintings and sculpture presented here are raw, intimate, and direct, capturing the suffering of the interwar years in unfiltered yet sophisticated terms. That such works are continually absent in art historical surveys is yet another reason why <em>Art for the People</em> is a refreshing if not incomplete project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, I would argue that <em>Art for the People</em> offers a broader and more pertinent message stemming from George Biddle’s example. When privilege is shared and used to uplift those without, space is granted to make room for others; when public exposure and funding is offered to a diverse population of artists through institutional support, the art will find its own unanticipated uses. In short, the exhibition forces us to reevaluate the structures by and for which art is produced, displayed, and disseminated—and to accept that reality as an integral part of all works of art. Just as the influence of the Church cannot be separated from the art of the Italian Renaissance, it is difficult to separate the artworks in <em>Art for the People</em> from inclusive government initiatives in support of the arts, and from the Dijkstra collection and curatorial initiatives. Most of all, these artworks can’t be separated from the diversity and confidence of the artists, who flourished beyond the demands of the WPA/FAP to capture the pain, struggle, and beauty of a perennially evolving nation.</p>

<p><strong>PEEL THE PROTECTOR OFF THE PHONE,</strong> take a photo of it, blow it up, print it, and hang it on the wall. That’s what Graham Littell has done in “I, Phone,” his latest solo show. He’s done it eight times with eight glass protectors and the effect is fantastic: If you walked inside the Schmidt Gallery at Principia College last month, you could have been in a cathedral with screen protectors for windows. Look in the windows and you would have found a lens into the life of the modern mind—broken, cracked, and confidently falling apart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I thought about exhibiting the screens by themselves,” Littell told me in a recent phone call about the show, “but they needed to be blown up to human scale for accessibility.” They’re more than accessible. 60 inches by 40, they’re dizzying, ghostly, delightful. Take <em>Dammy, 2023,</em> named for the screen protector’s former owner and the year he let it go. Here, as in each of the blown-up photos, the protective glass—usually a small thin skin on the phone display—becomes a soaring, semi-translucent canvas of cracks, crevices, and vagabond lines. These lines transmit action. The action recalls memory. The memory of a phone falling to earth.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Something else is going on. These are photos, sure. Photos of screen protectors which, covered to Hell with splits and rifts, take on the quality of a canvas. But the real canvas—the iPhone that these things served and protected—is missing. What we’re looking at—what these photos of chunked glass reveal—is the absence of the phone. The source, the power of modern life is gone, and what we are left with is, essentially, a broken shield. These shields loom large in the vacuum of the absent phone. They hang without the phone.

Mine?—shuffling across the screen, in pursuit of—love, cash, KFC? “The areas where you swipe,” Littell said of the physical screens he collected (not included in the show), “are minefields. Glass literally in your thumb.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the topic of how we live our lives, glass in thumb is up there with finding friend with thumb and ordering food with thumb. But that’s not what interests Littell. He’s interested in beauty. Not the beauty of the lines on the screens—although they are, in their own electric way, idiosyncratic and abstract—but the search for beauty <em>through</em> the phone, a search evident in the other photos in the show: a 7/11 sign at night, a woman sitting in a tram, a plastic bag on the wall, all shot on an iPhone. “We are living through the phone,” he told me. “We are using our phones to think. This act, this pursuit of beauty is taking place through the phone screen. My interest is in the play of photos and phone. I’m trying to overlap and fold things into each other. That’s how thought operates.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">In the gallery, Littell’s photographed screens fold into the photos shot <em>through</em> the screen. Like birds against the wind, they hover above a no man’s land of iPhone proportions. All they carry are surfaces of scars. Littell has saved these scars and held them up to a new light. There’s something reverent, even religious, about all these layers. The screen’s protector—its image—is elevated to the status of artwork. Gone is the phone that brought it into being. Gone is the god of our time.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">This Is Not Miami<br>
by Fernanda Melchor, transl. by Sophie Hughes<br>
Fitzcarraldo Editions (New Directions in the US), 2023<br>
$15.95 (New Directions edition)</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In Mexican literary journalist Fernanda Melchor’s Veracruz</strong>, the Mexican city and state are a far cry from the sprawling coffee fairs of Coatepec and the other eco-tourist attractions the state flaunts. In Melchor’s Veracruz, strange lights dance around the stars; they are not carrying aliens, but Colombian cocaine, and most of Veracruz’s children come to terms with the drug trade long before Santa Claus arouses any suspicion. If they’re not running the show themselves, Veracruz’s drug cartels are at least in cahoots with the state, rendering the life of a regular law-abiding citizen near-impossible. And while Veracruz is a state blessed with natural beauty, the place we find here the locals would escape in an instant, if only the means weren’t so far out of their reach. Melchor’s Veracruz is not Miami, nor is it the Veracruz of a tourist’s imagination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><a href=""https://www.ndbooks.com/book/this-is-not-miami/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">This is Not Miami</a></em>, published by New Directions (Fitzcarraldo Editions in the UK) and translated by Sophie Hughes, was initially released 10 years prior as <em>Aqui no es Miami</em> and marked Melchor’s full-length debut. The book itself might broadly be described as literary journalism, though Melchor offers us further classifications. Firstly, these stories might be considered <em>relatos</em> (i.e. tales or accounts), though Melchor also suggests the typically Latin American genre of <em>crónica</em>, “a hybrid form at once informative and interpretive, which has no entirely satisfying translation in English.” Like fellow investigative journalist Rudolfo Walsh, Melchor avoids sensationalism. Instead, she hones in on the effects on those involved, giving us authentic portraits of life in Veracruz. As she puts it, “at the heart of these texts is not the incidents themselves, but the impact they had on their witnesses.” Despite her involvement in the stories—sometimes as anecdotalist, more often as interviewer—Melchor abstains from sententiousness (Sophie Hughes’ English translation includes a revised version of one story, which sets out to provide “a more comprehensive, less biased” account). The result is a selection of stories that read more like certain episodes of Charles Baudelaire’s <em>Le Spleen de Paris</em>—observational, subterranean, and visceral—than mere reportage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the stories in <em>This is Not Miami</em> were written between 2002 and 2011 and provide a snapshot of a particularly barbaric time in Mexican history. In 2006, then-president Felipe Calderon launched his war on drugs, drafting the military to solve the threat drug cartels posed to everyday life in Mexico. Unless eliminated forcefully, these crime syndicates responded by upping the ante: more indiscriminate killings, more beheadings, and more acts of violence plastered over snuff websites like liveleak. Los Zetas, a cartel made up of military deserters, some with US army training, were by many considered to be the worst of the lot. They infect Melchor’s stories, as they did Veracruz: “to zacahuil” once referred to making the traditional corn dish in an outdoor brick oven; now, it can also refer to Los Zetas’ penchant for cooking humans, though usually in diesel—it burns slower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the final story in the collection, Melchor switches to second person, and her direct address puts us in the shoes of citizens of the Mexican port city. A cashier, who after dealing with regular shoppers—”women buying frozen gateaux… men who’d come for cigarettes, microwave dinners”—is met by a host of delinquents, whose ring leader wants to pay for a bulk order with a blank piece of plastic. He tries to politely refuse, but the customer isn’t budging: “if you don’t charge him using that card, you’d… end up dead… with a face full of holes and your brains blown out.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented""><em>This is Not Miami</em> is full of similar scenes, where everyday life and indiscriminate violence exist side by side, until they intertwine for a moment to flip some unfortunate soul’s life upside-down. If you’re lucky enough not to be forced out by such proximity to violence, the fear is enough to make paradise ugly. Take poor Señora Rita, whose quiet little corner of the world is rocked one day by a shootout. With the amount she’d spent on her new house, it’d be impossible to move again. The shooting stopped weeks ago, “but she can’t understand why the fear won’t leave her.” The constant threat of violence fills <em>This is Not Miami</em> like a foul odor. And it’s not as if the police can solve these problems. Melchor tells of Lázaro Linas—El Loca, “<em>King of the Downers</em>”—whose <em>tienditas</em> sold crack cocaine in the poor suburbs of Veracruz. These little shops also functioned as storage for hostages, stolen goods, and weapons. Even with the police in the know, “the line to buy blow would be so long it looked more like a queue for tortillas…” The message is clear: Don’t mess with my boys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stories in <em>This is Not Miami</em> are hopeless, violent and anxiety-inducing. Often, the closing lines read like tangents, as if Melchor becomes distracted from the subject at hand. “The House on El Estero,” for example, tells the story of Melchor’s first husband’s experiences in a haunted house, the evening when a friend was possessed and subsequently sent to a witch doctor. Melchor’s conclusion is abrupt and surprising: “And that’s how I met my first husband. That’s how I fell in love with the stories he told.” You’re left with the impression that this does a disservice to the story, that all that we read here—in the collection’s longest story—has more to do with trauma and uncertainty than storytelling and romance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The effect is not dissimilar in the end of “<em>Life’s Not Worth a Thing</em>,” wherein two lawyers refuse to offer legal help to some narcos: “[he] turned to me and said, like he always did whenever it seemed like we were in a fix we couldn’t get out of: <em>it’s not worth a thing, this life</em>,’ like the song from the Pedro Infante film, and I responded how I always did when I heard it: ‘<em>Life’s not worth a thing</em>.’” The fear is minimized by a sort of playfulness, an attempt to paint the new hole they’ve got themselves into as one they’ve dug themselves out of a thousand times already. Less concerned with the events themselves, these stories track attempts at recovery. What good would a direct comment from Melchor do to analyze or moralize any of these stories, when what they depict is so obvious?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This is Not Miami</em> courses through the gamut of Veracruz’s inhabitants. Melchor’s debut never panders, it isn’t interested in casting aspersions on the villains that fill these pages. Its finest quality is its portrayal of lives lived in such close proximity to horror, and yet where the violence never consumes them.</p>

<p class=""unindented"">The light outside the Alamo Rental Car is pellucid, a starkness that bathes us and all the dust-spattered cars around us. There’s a haphazard quality to this alleyway of rental joints and structures that reminds me of a cross between a construction site (there are high-visibility vest-wearing workers walking out from behind tall gates) and the industrial stretch of Oxnard Street in Van Nuys. It’s thrown together but it works.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’re outside because our rental car reservation for a Mitsubishi SUV was given away, the process of pre-booking meaning very little in small cities flooded by travelers in anticipation of an event one could call “biblical.” After some time in the sun while F. haggled in the office, our substitute chariot arrived: a small, red, dusty Volkswagen Vento (like a Jetta only smaller) with a missing hubcap and a license plate just that bit askew. We tetris our bags into the trunk, all five cram in, and off we zoom, the little 100-horsepower 1.6 liter inline-four wailing at 3500 rpm as I merge onto the highway where everyone seems to be doubling the modest speed limit marked 80 km/h.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The colors out here evoke both the sea <em>and</em> the desert; the landscape is at once rugged and relaxed—the sound of crunching gravel and waves breaking. We are on the edge of a large land mass and yet feel somewhat like we are on an island. We head to the beach in the towering presence of the RIU hotel (five stars according to Google Maps, looking like a Mormon temple mated with the Excalibur Hotel &amp; Casino Las Vegas to birth a replica of Havana’s Hotel Nacional) after a meal at a little palapa-inspired cantina called El Tequilita that caters to the resort crowd with tall, powerful margaritas and regional specialities. Ceviche. Shrimp tacos. Guacamole, pico de gallo, a fire-roasted spicy Sinaloan salsa. After the frenzy of arrival, this first round of drinks with the sun descending over the beach—a cool breeze riding in like a wave—reminds us that this is exactly why we are here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our little rented abode is within a housing development called Azul Marino, Pleasantville-style (“<em>Little boxes made of ticky tacky… little boxes all the same</em>”) but beachy, with a pleasing juxtaposition of sky blue, marine blue, palm tree green, and white walls that each heighten the other’s vibrance, and all with a speckling of fine brown dust that blows in from the environs. Three pools with tilework in varying states of soundness dot the property. Every little lane follows the theme: <em>Mar de Cortez, Mar de Caribe, Mar de Baltico, Mar de Bering, etc.</em> Developments like these appear to be popping up on these dusty rolling hills of Sinaloa like it's boom-country—cranes, construction workers, and scaffolding everywhere—and if Azul Marino is anything to go by, the pace may be considerably outperforming the craftsmanship.</p>

The white caps of breaking waves are pink, the water silvery blue; the sky burns with the setting sun. Drums beat in the distance and the last of the afternoon’s hawkers stroll back and forth carrying their hats, sunglasses, canteens, balloons, bandanas, blankets, and more in the cool but not yet chilly air, another long day fading behind them; they are bilingual at the very least.</p>

<p>For lunch, we’d eaten at a nondescript farm just off highway 503, El Ranchito Feliz.

Then, satiated with gratitude and politesse, we fail to come up with enough pesos in cash. I race back to the casa, gunning the Vento—its little motor wailing at 4000 rpms—and bring back a 500 peso note.</p>

<p>I am eager to begin rescuing all I’ve witnessed from the threat of forgetting.

<p>We drive to Copala, a silver mining town that dates back to 1565 in the municipality of Concordia, 610 meters up into the Sierra Madres. We get lost a couple times due to discrepancies between the “smart"" phone’s directions and veritable, extant roads. (We also pay over 300 pesos in various tolls.) We pass elaborate, decorous mountain cemeteries festooned with plastic flowers and multi-colored gravemarkers. In Copala, only the sounds of roosters, birds, people’s voices in backyards, a distant cowbell. Stillness and heat, bougainvillea, cacti, palms. San José de Copala, the stone church at the head of the plaza, was built around 1765 by the Marquis of Panúco, Francisco Javier Vizcarra Moreno. The Spanish crown supplied 200 pounds of gold to adorn various facets of the edifice. Scant evidence remains.</p>

<p class=""indented"">There is a man with a paunch in a dark polo shirt and jeans who tells some of these facts to the tourists wandering the church and its cobblestone perimeter. There are two or three separate groups, less than ten people in all, excluding our party of six that has dispersed about the area. Outside, he points to a disfigured knob in the weathered wall of the church and says it’s the face of the devil, that children would run around and throw stones at the face as a sort of game. A rooster crows.</p>

<p>We have lunch in the restaurant at the other end of the plaza. It is charming, partly indoors, partly outdoors, and all very much reminiscent of a nineteenth-century cantina in some western; whether or not this is evidence of my adulterated imagination, there’s little I can do about it. I love Mexico, yes, but perhaps unapologetically I love Sam Peckinpah the more for it. The menu is simple: two or three variations of grilled shrimp (<em>ranchera</em> or <em>mojo de ajo</em>), an <em>arrachera</em> (skirt) steak, ceviches, fajitas. L. and D. order margaritas; A. and P. split a Tecate light; I drink the same, the only beer available. One of the servers, all very friendly, is the younger, spitting image of the man at the church. Afterwards, he points us in the direction of a shop he says sells handmade leather goods and art. We browse around and there he is again to process my transactions—a wallet for my father and a belt for myself, both redolent of fine Mexican leather. He is courteous and also proprietary, they all are—they’re home.</p>

<p>Evening. Our first taste of Mazatlán proper: El Centro, with its historic core, international restaurants, price markups, and mickey mousing of Sinaloan culture for the tourists to enjoy at their tables where they sip $12 (USD) glasses of wine. At the Plazuela Machado, you hear a spattering of languages amid the hum and buzz of the hundreds moving, hovering over the music and the vendors. Most distinctive—and probably most common—is English. Yanquis—retired and in their prime alike—yanquis everywhere, smiling, laughing, fawning over the exotic pleasures to be found south of the border, their skin spotty, teeth veneered, eyes squinted or set back. I don’t think I’m incorrect in thinking of George Grosz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The architecture is distinctly neoclassical, French and Spanish colonial with those tropical flourishes that make it kin with Havana and New Orleans. Elaborate grillework and tall, open windows like carriage house doors. In lieu of a muted pastel palette, however, vibrance prevails: rich magentas, teals, seafoams and more which strike you whether they are peeling from the walls or not. Turns out, <em>Mazatlán</em> is a Nahuatl word for ""place of deer"" (though we spot not one). The city was already home to many indigenous cultures when it was colonized in 1531 by Spain. Over time, Mazatlán developed into a commercial seaport, importing equipment for the gold and silver mines in the mountains nearby. It served as the capital of Sinaloa from 1859 to 1873. Bavarian settlers (who had been emigrating—or exiling themselves?—throughout the 19th century) established the renowned Pacífico Brewery in 1900.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Along the Malecón, the scene shifts more toward the locals, although, once again,&nbsp;tourists abound. The Malecón is a familiar sight for Central and South Americans and Caribbean islanders alike, any of whom have lived or visited their coastal cities; that great meandering promenade atop a sea wall where leisure, flirtation, and mischief reign as the waves break along the stony shore and the sun sets in smoldering fuschia into the dark sea. As night envelopes the city, frenzy swishes back and forth and spills over the streets like a Solo cup at Carnaval, bass thumping from point to point. Saturday night, eclipse weekend.</p>

<p class=""indented"">At one point, an endless queue of bikers in their cuts—the motors of their elaborate cruisers roaring, the men with their women mounted behind them—stops in the middle of the sole northbound lane. Their patch reads Los Centauros: El Paso (or, one hell of a ride). With traffic stopped up in a streak behind them, they slowly begin the process of parking—one painstaking cruiser at a time. It is apparent they will be taking over La G Del Gato, a three-story eatery built into the cliffs of los Balcones de Loma Linda above, emblazoned with huge bright lights that shout: “PIZZA CEVICHE BURGERS,” a natural combination. People walking by stop to ogle and take photos, many of the female Centauros pose and take selfies, and while the horns blare the still-running motorcycle engines roar even louder while off-key karaoke bellows from a bar two buildings down and it all blends into a cacophony of such impressive magnitude I am momentarily swept up and lost as in a fever dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We turn back into the small cobblestone streets and wander aimlessly looking for an appealing bar or eatery that doesn’t feel like a Mexican interpretation of the generic trendy cuisine our country has whipped up and pervasively propagated with the skill of a Jehovah’s Witness: mixology, fusion, and jargon. White guys with man buns sip from their frosty glasses outside a mezcalería next door to a self-serious izakaya joint. Along the way I stop to admire the legions of abandoned, crumbling beauties, some with their roofs caved in and the flora growing wild, others seemingly frozen in suspended renovation. Outside of another impressive, darkened building I read a plaque that commemorates Herman Melville’s stay from 28 March to 16 April 1844 and suddenly I feel better: “<em>As for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.</em>” Was he, too, surrounded by so much boisterousness? Whatever happened, the trip marked the end of Melville’s wandering years at sea and, back in New York, he would begin to write in earnest.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Back in the car for the drive back after a tasty if overpriced meal in a brick courtyard off Avenida Cinco de Mayo, we pull into the electric night, the streets jam-packed with so many vehicles, so many cabs, so many parties of people looking to cross to and from the neutral grounds, current-like swirls of cars and motorbikes at every roundabout, like schools of fish in the cold, blue depths. I know Mazatlán is a tourist destination. Unlike its confrère, Cancún, in the eastern state of Quintana Roo, Mazatlán—with its aesthetic beauty, active port, and mining interests—is more comparable to San Francisco, whether the Twin Peaks-meets-Coit Tower-esque Balcones de Loma Linda are taken into account or not. But today so much of this human profligacy is actually gathered here for something majestic and wholly beyond the confines of our terrible human smallness, that as the high priests once marked the celestial calendar with fiestas, here we were again, one gigantic swirling multi-day fiesta in anticipation of something celestial, extraterrestrial. Bodies in furious motion were here awaiting four minutes in the near future in which we yearned to be overcome, rapt in attention, heads upturned to the infinite.</p>

<p class=""unindented"">More recon for an eclipse viewing spot. Each morning a rush of sounds from the birds, varieties of noises and calls foreign and unknown, polychromatic sounds resounding layer upon layer, foreground, middle, and back. Wind chimes and little knockings before the sounds of voices, then a baby somewhere, too. At eight in the morning the sky is blue and bright, with more delicate streaks of white than yesterday, even some patches, something like an expressionist gouache on the firmament. I track this because again the weather report reads “overcast.” When overcast in California, the brightness of sunny days is replaced with a pall of such dreary weight, heavy gray caps our world end to end without a flicker or spot of blue in sight like a reprimand, depression and languor a certainty. But this, this we’ll take.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two people lighter (L. and D. opting to hang poolside), we drive back up along Highway 40, this time without any mistakes, only higher and higher into the Sierra Madre Occidental, past yesterday’s familiar sights (shrines, villages, cemeteries) and into tighter and tighter switchbacks and hairpins, by shuttered or abandoned cantinas and restaurants built into the rockface. We snake off the main route at Potrerillos and climb a little until we reach a plateau, lush and loamy, surrounded by mountains, one directly ahead capped by a boulder that looks like a jagged molar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are in the town of Chirimoyos, 65 kilometers east and 1.6 km above sea level, i.e. Mazatlán. It is a town of no more than 200 people, and with a typical array of beautiful mangy stray dogs, mutts all of them with such variegated coats and eye colors and ears, and also a variety of livestock—<em>burros</em>, horses, even mountain goats. Each resident is self-sustaining, consuming what they produce: honey, coffee, eggs, corn, even gum. We stand at the deck at the Observatorio, behind the tiny “Academia par la Ciencia Futuro,” its letters all but worn away by the wind, with a banner welcoming all for the “Eclipse Petaca-Chirimoyos 2024.” We admire a spectacular panorama of mountains upon mountains upon mountains, foreground, middleground, background in subtle shades of brown and darkened mauve. Silence between breezes, and from down a hill behind us, we begin to hear sounds like a drum circle resonating with the wind, likely coming from the collection of tents we saw by the school. We know we have found the spot for the eclipse, but we bid it a bittersweet farewell, for the road is too treacherous for a Vento packed with six people.</p>

<p class=""indented"">We drive up to photograph the sign demarcating the Tropic of Cancer and back down to eat at a charcoal grill set in front of a small convenience window that sells snacks and sodas in the shadow of a tall overpass (Federal Highway 40D). The area is not unlike Big Sur, once you pass Deetjen’s on the run up to Loma Vista. A tanned man with prominent cheekbones and sunglasses turns smoking steak over the coals. Steak, sold by the kilo or half kilo. We have a friendly conversation with the proprietor, a young geologist who works for a Canadian company digging silver mines in the area. He is from Concordia, about a thousand meters closer to earth, and speaks English well. “These mines will be good for all the people here, for these villages. More jobs, more money.” He sells here weekends because, as he put it simply, there’s no cattle up in these mountains, and no cattle means no steak. His girlfriend calculates the prices, his friend (who doesn’t say a single word the whole time we’re there) cooks the steak. The handmade tortillas are delectable and we smear them with creamy, spicy refried beans, piles of steak strips, jalapeño and onion off the grill, and another of those fire-roasted salsas. We buy another kilo of meat to take home.</p>

<p>That evening, with 12 hours until the eclipse, F. obsesses over the weather reports. Recon has failed to produce a viable option, if not a stunning one. We spend the evening crunching alternatives. We settle on a small town called San Francisquito for the familiarity of its name and the presence of a small plaza with a view of the sky unobscured by tall trees or buildings.</p>

The morning hustle on the highways begins regardless, less evidence of eclipse chasers and more of the Monday morning grind. We have the luxury to choose, but all said and done we all will stare up at the sky. Just outside of the town we come across a lake lined by lush greenery: mixed grasses, palm, mango, and date trees, bougainvillea, the vibrant sounds of so much life—land and aquatic birds, frogs, insects, and reptiles scuttling or lounging about in silence. Rolling hills surround us with the Sierra Madres of yesterday to the east, in the direction of Durango. We settle atop a mound between the dirt roads that crisscross the area, home to cabins and rental properties in the distance, with a clear view of the lake and the wide open sky. The gang wants breakfast and I volunteer to hang back with a beach chair and a book to protect our spot.</p>

F. and D. boogie board. I look up and down the shore, at the tall resort towers to the north, the rocky promontory to the south. People sit, children play, the waves roar—swell, break, beat the shore, and pull away. Nothing has really changed yet I want it to, I want something to have been irrevocably marked.

<p>The last total solar eclipse to hit Mexico was July 11, 1991. The zone of totality passed through Mexico City, lasting over six minutes. In Baja California, the temperature dropped from 13 degrees celsius to six degrees celsius in minutes. In other areas temperatures dropped below zero. Fear of losing sight, prenatal deformities, and strange animal behavior gripped many despite the endless explanations and precautions offered by the authorities and the media. There were no smartphones. The Zocalo went dark, the corona visible through a belltower. It was known as “the Great Mexican Eclipse.”</p>

<p>Now they have all largely gone. The few that remain take on the semblance of hangers-on, children lost or forgotten nursing their hangovers and wandering—wondering how they’ll spend their remaining pesos. At the pool at the Azul Marina with L. and D., the man tasked with keeping an eye on us guests begins to turn. In indecipherable Spanish—spoken with great rapidity—he admonishes us for coming to his country knowing hardly a lick of the language. “You all come here saying <em>nada, </em>understanding <em>nada. Americanos</em>,”&nbsp; he gestures away with his hands, “<em>a ya</em>.” At least, we want to say, we’ve used what broken words we have to do our best. At least, we want to say, we are friendly and grateful. But we don’t. As much beauty as there is here, reality has its grim reminders. Mexico is the product of a complex and violent history and the convoluted circumstances by which its northern neighbor has in many ways dictated the very terms of its existence; by controlling the rules of play, we have stubbornly dictated the parameters of Mexico’s potential.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I make out a sense of languor and aimlessness in the air. The city—and maybe the continent—is somewhat extinguished following the immense buildup to the eclipse. The dark band that draped us in supplication and ecstasy for all of four minutes, encircled by a smoldering horizon at “sunset” with an ethereal corona overhead, also took something from us. I think we all must suffer today, and maybe even some for days yet from the vulnerability this interstitiality teased out of us. Enter languor. A little death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In “Market Day,” D.H. Lawrence makes much of collective catharsis, the strange compulsion to unite in order to feel something beyond ourselves, suprapersonal. “That, which is most elusive, still the only treasure… Only that which is utterly intangible matters.” In ritual, humanity is at its most essential as a force subservient to grander forces, some large terrific thrust beyond our reason. We see the force, the centrifugal spin, of the planets as evidence and example of the ferocity intrinsic to Lawrence’s circular interpretation of existence. In the eclipse, we experienced a sort of one plus one equals three that results from encounters with elemental forces. The strange liminal zone between ourselves and the great wonder (or the interminable void) is more meaningful and luminous than our inadequate selves and the incommunicable other. There is something greater beyond our bodies we yearn to touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a lazy, contemplative day. Pool. Food. Beach. Tomorrow, back to the city for the final day. Thursday morning, <em>aeropuerto</em>. For now we will continue to eat and drink, and drink and eat. I kiss my wife and hold her hand as the waves break and the sun, full-force, commands the sky. “<em>We both step and do not step into the same rivers, we both are and are not.</em>”</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Sones de Mariachi<br>
Mariachi Los Camperos<br>
Folkways Records, 2024<br>
$9.99 (Digital), $16.99 (Compact disc)</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>A thousand flowers will bloom</strong></em>. Music that guides the body is music that offers the body what it seeks. Mariachi Los Camperos’s latest release on Folkways Records,<em> Sones de Mariachi</em>,<em> </em>is an album of strength and uninhibited voice—of freedom, that connects the listener with an entrancing, sometimes agrarian, worldview. Los Camperos re-arranges fifteen fast-paced Mariachi classics to speak to our present condition, a melancholic, exhausted, hyper-modernizing world. It's a world that longs for ontological stability and a sense of inner and communal peace: in other words, a life well lived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Este son de Michoacán</em>.” “This song is from Michoacán,” they sing in tandem on “The Son of Dog,” violons ablaze. This is music from Mexico. Founded in 1961, during the early years of the Chicano movement, Los Camperos is best known in the United States for backing Linda Rondstadt on her album<em> Canciones de Mi Padre</em>. But they have been groundbreaking even if their musical tradition has been obscured by LA’s mythology of LA music, like the “Laurel Canyon” scene and other hegemonic moments in American music history.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What is this tradition? It’s the path to joy and stability—the journey of Mexicans in LA—and it is most infectious in this album. Listen to “El Palmero” and hear the cosmic gallantry of shoes and dresses that aren’t purchased on Sunset Boulevard, but should be. The woodwork of a Mariachi’s <em>vihuela</em>, chatting, riffing, rapping along to a violin or a harp, about a laborer who climbs palm trees for coconuts while he thinks of the woman he loves. It's an image painted a million times, in the Caribbean and in Latin America, as a way of breaking and mending a laborer’s life into a mosaic of colorful pieces.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In “The Four Cards,” the singer asks “<em>Señora, si usted quisiera hacerme una caridad</em>,” or “Missus if you’d like to, please offer me a gift,” in language that takes its time with “lover’s discourse,” to use Roland Barthes’ concept without bringing in the heaviness of French theory. The city that hosts this discourse is one where ends don’t have to justify the means and dialog is wholly a part of lovemaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mozart’s “String Quintet in G Minor” comes to mind, as do his folk themes like the Magic Flute. The singing in “El Toro Viejo” invites us to meet the <em>vaquero</em>, as well as other characters from a distant mythology. The same goes for both the camperos and the caporal in “El Toro Antejuelo,” “dying of a hangover / with a pistol in hand / saying to Los Camperos / play El Toro again.” Flourishes of strings and horns, along with harp overtones, assure us this is a worthwhile and meaningful mythology, people and places worthy of meeting. “El Tranchete” (The Knives), an acoustic song, invites us into a world of knives curved like ocean waves, during a time when Spain was Arab and Andalusia was something like California, its markets full of different varieties of dates, its music entrancing, and its academic life legendary. Joy, as heard in “El Tranchete,” grounded in strength, courteousness, and humor, is the&nbsp;constant this music promotes. Almost a work of prophecy, it invites us to conjoin in dance, in a moment of social cohesion, to find humor in meaningfulness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“<em>Ay bonito</em>,” how beautiful, the choir sings in “El Cuervo.” I’d love to take a walk with Jesús “Chuy” Guzmán through Los Angeles, not as a journalist, but as a friend, as the narrator in Herman Hesse’s <em>Steppenwolf </em>does with Herr Pablo, leader of a jazz band. A narrator who can think and write courageously but can’t dance is, in the end, out of step. “You need me to teach you to dance, to laugh, to live,” Hermine, who introduces him to Pablo, tells the narrator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d ask Guzmán about the bull, the donkey, and the sparrowhawk, all titles from the album. In a city in love with the mariposa—the butterfly—what is a donkey? Humor is the foundation of better living. This is the philosophy traditional music offers our trying time. It's high time not just Los Angeles county considers this gift, this living tradition—a mythology in song—but the rest of the world too.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Poet, translator, painter, polymath Willis Barnstone lives in a one-story clapboard house on a quiet tree-lined street off Pleasant Valley Road in Oakland, California. Barnstone’s voice is a delicate tenor, bashful on approach until eagerness overcomes him and he begins showing us his latest watercolors. His home is warm and welcoming, decorously overflowing with the art objects and ephemera he has collected—together with his partner, the Chinese art historian Sarah Handler—through many years of travel. Along with a new translation of Baudelaire’s <em>Les fleurs du mal</em>, he has been at work on vividly colored line portraits of famous figures in history (Cervantes, Shakespeare, MLK, etc.)<br>
<br>
We are talking about Jorge Luis Borges when we start recording. Throughout, the flow of conversation is interrupted, shaped and punctuated by Barnstone’s many worldly digressions. Ms. Handler is always graciously there to assist and prod the conversation along. He shows us the photographs he took for the Saturday Evening Post and Holiday Magazine, his many more paintings and watercolors, his photographs of Borges, the many varieties of hand-carved sculpture from various cultures—ancient Chinese date unknown; an armless Filipino Jesus. All while we sit and chat he gets a call from a friend, reminisces on fallen friends, mis-hears a good deal, and carries himself with such great vitality, enthusiasm, and wonder that occasionally the two of us wonder if we’ve been taking this whole business of words and language too soberly. For Barnstone, who turns 97 later this year, remaining light-footed and open-hearted are the keys to posterity. This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Willis Barnstone's first teaching position was instructor in English and French at the Anavryta Classical Lyceum in Greece, 1949–50, a private school in the forest of Anavryta north of Athens, attended by prince Constantine, the later ill-fated king of Greece, who was then nine years old. In 1951 he worked as a translator of French art texts for Les Éditions Skira in Geneva, Switzerland. He taught at Wesleyan University, was O'Connor Professor of Greek at Colgate University, and is now Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Spanish at Indiana University where he has been a member of East Asian Languages &amp; Culture, and the Institute for Biblical and Literary Studies. He started Film Studies at Indiana and initiated courses in International Popular Songs and Lyrics and Asian and Western Poetry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His center is poetry, but his books range from memoir, literary criticism, gnosticism, and biblical translation to the anthologies <em>A Book of Women Poets from Antiquity to Now</em>, 1980 (with Aliki Barnstone) and <em>Literatures of Asia, Africa, and Latin America</em>, 1998 (with Tony Barnstone), and collections of photography and drawings. <em>Funny Ways of Staying Alive, Poems and Ink Drawings</em>, 1993, contains 103 dry brush drawings. His <em>New Faces in China</em>, 1973, a volume of photographs and facing poems, reveals China during the catastrophic Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Children play and smile wildly while austere adults, in identical prison-like attire, sit on the pavement in empty Tiananmen Square. In 1966 he founded and was director of Artes Hispánicas/Hispanic Arts, a slick, bilingual journal of Spanish and Portuguese art, literature, and music, published biannually by Macmillan Books and Indiana University. Two of its issues were published simultaneously as trade books: <em>The Selected Poems of Jorge Luis Borges</em>, guest editor Norman Thomas di Giovanni, and <em>Concrete Poetry: A World View</em>, guest editor Mary Ellen Solt. In 1959 he was commissioned by Eric Bentley for the Tulane Drama Review to do a verse translation of <em>La fianza satisfecha</em>, an obscure, powerful play by the Golden Age Spanish playwright Lope de Vega; his translation, <em>The Outrageous Saint</em>, was later adapted by John Osborne for his A Bond Honoured (1966). In 1964 the BBC Third Programme Radio commissioned him to translate for broadcast Pablo Neruda's only play, the surreal verse drama <em>Fulgor y muerte de Joaquin Murieta</em> (Radiance and Death of Joaquin Murieta), which was also published in Modern International Drama, 1976.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Guggenheim fellow, he has four times been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, and has had four Book of the Month Club selections. His poetry has appeared in <em>The Paris Review</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Poetry Magazine</em>, <em>The New York Review of Books</em>, and <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em>. His books have been translated into diverse languages including French, Italian, Romanian, Arabic, Korean, and Chinese. Barnstone lives in Oakland, California, with his wife Sarah Handler. A full-time writer, he gives poetry readings, often with his daughter Aliki Barnstone and son Tony Barnstone.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM</strong>: When did you first meet Borges?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you know the Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) on 102nd Street and Lexington Avenue? Every week they’d have a great writer or painter, and one day they had Borges, and afterwards I went up on stage and spoke to him in Spanish. I said that I had done a book on Machado and he said, “El Bueno or El Malo?” Bueno was Antonio, because he was on the Republican side. And of course Borges mixed them all up intentionally. He was always horsing around. But his speech was as poetic and significant as when he wrote.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">His speech was like his writing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If anything, it was better. I knew him for twenty years. I spent a year with him in Buenos Aires and I invited him to Indiana for a semester each time. When I took him to the University of Chicago Institute, a doctor told me, “I can cure him with a simple operation.” Borges refused. I often have nightmares that the doctor could have cured him. Being blind, he saw everything. When I was in Buenos Aires, I lived across the street from him and his wife, María Kodama. One day, Borges knocked on my door and said, “Barnstone”—he always called me Barnstone—“What does María Kodama look like? She tells me she’s very lovely.” And I said to him, “Borges, you’re a fool. She’s beautiful and you don’t deserve her.” I always teased him. Everybody flattered him and he couldn’t stand that.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You talk about translation as an art form. Can you talk about your philosophy of translation as art and why you believe it is an art unto itself?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think translation is a creation. The word “translation” is from Latin, “<em>translatio</em>,” meaning to move from place to place. It’s just a continuation. You expand the English language—or any language—by having a translation. The very act of speaking is a translation of mind into talk.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Translation of old texts brings the spirit, the beauty of the original text to the present, and that is continuously changing. When and how were you first drawn to the Bible for translation?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was a kid, my parents didn’t know much about religion, but we were Jews. All the [Bible] stories are fake, but so what? We don’t really know much about them. The Third Millennium is the first time we hear about the Jews. They didn’t schlep stones to build the pyramids, because the Egyptians were a few millennia earlier. But you wonder what kind of religious texts they had before the Bible was there, or what held them together. In Antiquity the Jews were twenty percent of the population, now they’re one half of one percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you may remember, the normal form in Hebrew was two lines, and then a repetition of them, pushed over a little bit—that is, the same thing said differently. Which is an interesting way of getting the message across. I loved doing <em>Poets of the Bible</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">As a translator, do you find that you internalize the original work, by knowing it well, so that when you sit down to compose, you’re writing a poem in its spirit? Or are you doing direct text-to-text comparison.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want to be close to the words. I want to know them as much as I can, and know their possibilities. I think the original poet has to be respected, but I think it doesn’t matter if the translation is close or far, so long as it’s good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">You write about Edward FitzGerald. He didn’t respect the original Persian <em>Rubaiyat</em> of Omar Khayyam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>What makes you say that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer""><em>You</em> said that. In <em>The Poetics of Translation</em>, you say he had this “bright arrogance” where he took the original Rubaiyat and basically made a new one for Victorian England. It was very popular, but totally different from the original. You’re talking about the respect for the original, but he disregards the original and makes a new text.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>(Barnstone struggles to recall this specific conceit so Handler looks for the book so we may point out the quote. A few minutes pass within which Barnstone says, among other niceties, “I want to tell you something.

<p class=""interviewer"">Do you have any favorite translations or translators? Ancient, modern, contemporary?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m out of touch with contemporary, unfortunately. I never was able to get a subscription to <em>Poetry</em>. I kept sending them money, and they never sent me the magazine. I knew the editor quite well.… You know, when I used to go, with great pleasure and slight displeasure to the Translation Society, and they gave me a plaque—which I have over my desk, for ""Life Achievement""—but it was run by a bunch of gangsters. They were mediocre poets and kept giving the prizes to themselves. You couldn’t translate a pinball machine into a sewing machine. They were hopeless. I can tell, if I read two lines, if a person is good or bad. The lines have to be good—I don’t care if they’re accurate or not. It would be nice if they’re accurate, but they have to be good. The method doesn’t matter so long as it’s quality.</p>

<p>I thought Lowell was fantastic, whatever he did. I remember he went to Buenos Aires once.

And then suddenly he began to scream, lay on the floor, and pulled his trousers down.” And I said, “He’s a wonderful poet but has episodes of madness.” Borges said, “I don’t care what you say, so long as he keeps his trousers on.” I met Lowell.

<p>I like to make the form not clang.

After we crossed the border from Fragrant Island, Hong Kong, they put us in a big room for four hours. We were starving, and suddenly six waiters came in, dressed like English lords, and served us food. That’s how we got to China. Everybody stayed for two weeks, and then went back. I didn’t have to go back, because I had the semester off, so I stayed for three months. They didn’t have American currency. So I could go to any place, get on any plane. There was saw dust on the floors of planes then. And the women who took care of you—the hostesses—were barefoot.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1972. We were in the middle of the Cultural Revolution. And you know the woman behind it was Mao’s wife. Mao himself was dying of syphilis and a dozen other things, but you know, when I asked to speak with Mao—there were only seven other foreigners in China at the time—the authorities always said he was with the people. But he was actually dying. And his wife was taking over, the so-called Gang of Four. So when Sarah and I met in China, it was the most liberal period, and everyone was getting more and more optimistic. Prior, Mao had forced everyone—men and women—to look alike.</p>

<p>Because I heard that Mao was the best poet. But it’s very easy to be the best poet when everyone else is excluded. He wrote in traditional Chinese poetic form, and he didn’t allow anyone else to publish in that kind of form. I was happy to be in China in those days.… Today, China has gotten rid of the worst of its poverty, it’s true. But the executions continue. Just like in Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>It was an accident. I married a Greek so I went to Greece. The war was ending when I went to Mount Athos. I had an escort of three policemen on horseback in front and I was on horseback and they pointed there and they said, “Those are guerillas and there’s no point in shooting at them because they’ll shoot back at us.” I spent a month at the monasteries in Mt. Athos, the medieval center of Greek and Russian Orthodoxy. You go from one to another, usually three or four hours away. It’s on a big peninsula in North-East Greece, high in the mountains. Depending on the monastery, they would make icons and sell them to the people who visited. It was very hard to get in there, but who knows what’s going on today. I think there are very few monks in Greece now.</p>

In those days, the world was small. I wrote to Camus and I told him about my Spanish background, and he immediately answered—the letters are in the Lilley Library at Indiana and the Library of Congress—and he only learned French when he was 8 years old. His mother was a Spaniard and his father, who was French, died in the First World War on the first day of combat. So Camus grew up speaking Spanish.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think it happened after I went to Greece. Sappho gave us lyric poetry. She gave us the meters we use for poetry. They tried to wipe her out over and over again. But her fragments remain. And the fragments are more modern than antiquity. And she had daughters, but she was clearly bisexual. There’s no fragment by Sappho that is not beautiful.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it depends. You know, the best translations are closer and closer to the spirit. If you’re good with language, you can do it any damn way. But if you’re not an artist, no matter what you do, you’re not going to make it. So, to use a cliche, there are many ways to Rome.</p>

Every day for years he ranted against the Jews. Not once, but everyday on the radio. And it was the Jewish lawyers who saved him from execution when he came back. I like the last poems in the Cantos and the early ones, which are really translations from the Anglo Saxon. He did know languages. He did compose an opera or something. He was talented but was lousy.

And he said, “Oh yes, when I was eight years old, living in Geneva with my parents, I saw some so-called fairy tales written by a person, and he quoted him. And my friend said, “It’s exact!

<p class=""interviewer"">Taking this term—to loaf, to idle, to wander, and also to produce poetry. You’re a traveler, you’ve been around the world—do you find that there is something of the eternal traveler who renounces the impositions of economic productivity to produce poetry?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In your pocket anthology <em>Modern European Poetry </em>from 1966, you’re the one who exclusively translates Machado, of course, Jimenas, and Salinas. They’re very evocative and rural and beautiful, like landscapes. They reminded me of Japanese haikus. The quiet epiphanies and the simplicity—is that a commonality you look for?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve always been interested in pictorial poems. The great poets of the 20th Century were Russian, Spanish, and Greek, and of course some wonderful French and Italian, too. And I think that’s largely it. There are all kinds of ways of speaking Spanish, but there’s nothing like Castilian. It’s so beautiful. I like Andelusian, like Lorca. He spoke marvelous Spanish. In Northwestern Spain, it’s almost Portuguese, a mixture. I wish I could have known Lorca but he was murdered in 1939. He was the greatest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two best poets of the 20th Century are Lorca and Dylan Thomas. When people asked Dylan Thomas, who was the greatest poet, he said Lorca. He didn’t know Spanish, but he knew him in translation. In 1951, I went to see his play in New York—<em>Under Milkwood</em>—and they wrote in the papers that he was all washed up, but he was only about thirty-seven. We saw him on stage, he looked like he was twenty-five with a magnificent voice, like nothing you’ve heard before. Now I don’t like all of Dylan Thomas. His last poems are just wonderful, his plays. His short stories are also fabulous. But most of his poems are not good. It doesn’t matter… So I’m coming back from the play, there’s snow on the ground in Central Park, and I have to go back to the West Side where I live and suddenly I’m walking along, and this guy bangs into me. It’s Dylan Thomas. We’re both rolling in the snow. And he says, “I’ve got to get back to the Chelsea Motel.” So he got roaring drunk when he went downtown, at the White Horse Tavern. And unfortunately that was that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did you ever hear of the poet Ruth Stone? She’s a good poet. She won a Pulitzer. She was one of our closest friends. And she was funny. She told me this story that she and Richard Wilbur were in the front seat, driving, and in the back seat was Dylan Thomas and Wilbur’s wife. And when they got where they were going, Wilbur’s wife said, “I didn’t know what to do. He was feeling me up all the time. And I didn’t even have a brassiere on.” And Wilbur said, “You should have been happy, you had more fun.” I’ve heard a lot of stories from the horse’s mouth.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">When you approach translation, especially in poems that communicate some form of desire, is the desire yours, or are you trying to convey the desire in the poem, or is it a combination? For instance, when you write your own sonnets, your love is coming through. But when you’re translating, are you picking up, are you finding your own sensuality in the poem and transmitting that?</p>

3232,"Cowboy Take Me Away","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A PORTRAIT OF GERONIMO </strong>hangs<strong> </strong>next<strong> </strong>to John<strong> </strong>Wayne. John Wayne<em> </em>is depicted with a gun held toward the corner of the room, his body open toward Geronimo, while Geronimo<em> </em>faces the viewer fully, with his eyes averted to the left, away from John Wayne. Like a cowboy claustrophobia, the West closes in. The pair form a part of “Andy Warhol: Cowboys and Indians,” an exhibit hanging in the Museum of the Big Bend in Alpine, Texas. Warhol’s work, many thousands of paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints associated with a particularly New York sensibility, is given a rework: Here, the fourteen prints ask, What is<em> </em>the West?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s an immediate flippancy to the fourteen prints on view, similar to Warhol’s other works, that demures from complexity. If you stare long enough, however, the complexity starts to reveal itself. Stand in front of the print of John Wayne, for example, and you might see yourself, and your preconceptions about the West, staring back at you. Warhol would never have admitted to this kind of political reorientation; he routinely denied that his work harbored any social or political commentary. “If you want to know all about Andy Warhol,” he said, “just look at the surface of my paintings and the films and me, and there I am. There’s nothing behind it.” Nevertheless, his works <em>have</em> an uncanny ability to project the viewer, and their preconceptions about the West, back at themselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warhol wore cowboy boots every day. The mythology of the West  was always with him, walking him around the world all the way to <em>Cowboys and Indians,</em> the last series of prints he completed before his death in 1987. On the first wall of the exhibit, four prints depicting Indigenous people and objects—like a Plains Indian shield and kachina dolls—are flanked by General Custer and Teddy Roosevelt. In the gallery, as in the land, “the Indians” are surrounded—there is no escape from the so-called “heroes” of the West. These calculated juxtapositions force the viewer to re-examine the “hero” and their possible identification with him, while repositioning Native Americans at the heart of Western symbology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">On the second wall, Apache and Plains Tribes leaders are interspersed with people who symbolize the Hollywood-ification of the West, like the aforementioned Wayne and the sharp-shooter Annie Oakley. At the outer edges are <em>Buffalo Nickel </em>and <em>Indian Head Nickel,</em> which depict the transformation of Native Americans from something to be conquered, like on the first wall, to something to be commodified. The prints are all the same size with each subject positioned roughly in the center of a white background, with the exception of <em>Annie Oakley </em>and <em>War Bonnet Indian</em>, whose subjects are in profile and facing inward, toward the prints in the middle. <em>Geronimo </em>and <em>John Wayne</em> hang side by side and have similar coloration of yellow, orange and red. These are colors that evoke what we think of as the West — red plateaus, dirt and dust, the relentless glow of the sun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">John Wayne was a Western icon spoiled with Hollywood riches and Geronimo was a prisoner of war trotted out to Wild West Shows in traditional attire to appease and delight tourists. This curation cuts to the heart of the show and back to the question posed earlier: saturated with “Western” images and mythology, what even <em>is</em> the West? The long and storied history of Indigenous peoples or the Hollywood interpretation? Historically, Americans have a tendency to ignore real stories in favor of ready-made symbols. We are John Wayne. We are the Buffalo Nickel. We are the extraction of culture into digestible images that <em>feel</em> authentic, but are only vague gestures at authenticity. Or, with the luxury of looking back that the exhibition affords, we <em>were </em>John Wayne and Buffalo Nickel and so on. But who are “we” now?</p>

<p>What about Marfa, the little town twenty minutes west of the show? In <em>America</em>, Jean Baudrillard&nbsp;writes that “driving is a spectacular form of amnesia. Everything is to be discovered, everything to be obliterated.” The drive to Marfa takes six and a half hours from Austin. You wind through the Hill Country, slowing down at a speed-trap town every fifty or so miles, until the landscape flattens out and you can suddenly see to the horizon. Although I’ve been out to West Texas more times than I can count, every six months or so I get the irresistible itch to drive West. The first time was more than a decade ago, before I knew or cared to know who Donald Judd was. But seeing his concrete works recontextualized, for me, what Texas could be. It’s a place of extremes—extreme weather, extreme politics, extreme size. There’s extreme openness, both literally and figuratively, and extreme work. As a child, I desperately wanted to be anywhere but Texas, but that first time in Marfa, I learned that you could be a Texan <em>and</em> an artist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Marfa is a place of contradictions. In one day, you might walk through kicked-up dust to get a six-dollar coffee in a renovated auto body shop, wander around Robert Irwin’s <em>Untitled (Dawn to Dusk),</em> hike the Davis Mountains, eat James Beard Award-winning barbecue and, if you’re lucky, meet a local who will let you ride their horse. Marfa <em>feels</em> like Texas, with its big skies and lethargic contentment, and that’s what people, like me, are looking for. Those places where you can grasp that slippery feeling of <em>realness.</em> There’s a problem here, though. Does interloping as a renegade art cowboy for a weekend bring you closer to authenticity or further away from it? For most people, Marfa is a vacation, not real life. And if you find something that feels more real than your real life, what happens when you return home? Where does living authentically end and fetishization begin?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Andy Warhol remains one of the highest grossing artists of all time. Naturally, that makes me skeptical of his ability to teach us about authenticity. <em>Cowboys and Indians</em> can be interpreted in at least two ways. There is the earnest view, where the images are designed to be a mirror to show us how extractive and self-serving we are (or were). We want to be authentic, but we want it to be easy, like taking a vacation. Then, there’s the skeptical approach, where Warhol was doing little more than gratifying his own fetish for the West, claiming these images—of Native Americans and Hollywood westerns—as his own while denying his work had any “political meaning,” as if symbology is fair game when divorced from politics. heather ahtone, the senior curator at the American Indian Cultural Center and Museum, says that “what is most important to take away is that the image of the American Indian has for too long been managed, controlled and constructed by non-Native people who saw the subject as a mythical, even mundane, figure and subject to exploitation as a commodity.”</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The cowboy as we know him existed for thirty years, give or take. The myth and the images remain impermeable. As a Texan, I’ve been surrounded by these images my entire life. The cowboy. The Native American. The sharp-shooter. These images are borrowed or stolen or made up, based on a culture that, as a white American, is not mine. But, this is where I get stuck. Does that history make the images, or my feelings toward them, inauthentic? Does authenticity lie in the past or the future?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Marfa today, there are a lot more people taking photos of themselves. On my Instagram feed, friends and acquaintances pose with cowboy hats and boots, sun on their face and dust-blasted buildings in the background. There are stores selling two-hundred and fifty dollar linen shirts from boutique brands out of Los Angeles. My impulse is to photograph everything. The landscape feels so <em>real</em> and if only I could capture that realness, then I could learn how to be, and feel, authentically Texan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Warhol said, “Everybody has their own America, and then they have the pieces of a fantasy America that they think is out there but they can’t see.” Out West, you can see the fantasy. It’s in the barren landscape, the big sky, the dry heat, and the people who live their lives in it all. The problem with looking for the West to give you something is that it’s not yours to take.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I left the Museum of the Big Bend, I noticed that the colors in Warhol’s prints matched the colors of the blooming desert flowers. Bright yellows, deep reds, muted purples. In all of my time going out West, I’d never caught the bloom. There were no clouds in the sky, just a perfectly blue dome resting over the agaves, the cacti, and me. But all I could think about was the&nbsp;last print in the series, <em>Action Picture, </em>completed a year before Warhol died. It’s the only print with a brown background—the rest were on white—which evokes earthiness, even a return to naturalness. Native Americans are on horseback and in the center someone holds a handgun. It’s pointed at me, as if to say, You can run, but you can’t hide.</p>

<p><strong>IMAGINE A MAN </strong>in a stable marriage. He loves his wife, he works hard. But his wife works hard too—she’s got her own job, she keeps house, takes care of the kids. He needs a little nightly affirmation; sexual, sure, but also things like “You’re absolutely right, you’re a great guy, I <em>appreciate</em> you”—all the things he’d like his wife to say but can’t be relied upon to because she’s too exhausted to lie. So he turns to his “artificial intimacy avatar,” a friction-free solution to a desperate human problem, funded by his friendly, zero-liability tech firm who mines for profit all the sweet nothings and naked somethings of his every interaction.</p>

<p>Around the turn of the last century, before the advent of emotional support avatars, Norman Mailer warned: “There is a certain passion that’s dying in American life… People are becoming less and less interested in looking at ugly problems and debating questions that are not quickly answered.… Technology has brought us further and further away from our instincts—we’re flattening out people’s spirits, we are surrounded by faces but everyone is always incredibly alone.” Since he first said these words for his PBS American Masters episode “<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/masters/norman-mailer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Mailer on Mailer</a>,” American society has moved further and further into the technological abyss.

Made with the full cooperation of the Mailer family (normally the “kiss of death” for projects like these), Zimbalist and co.’s picture manages to include many of the author’s numerous messy moments—starting with the 1961 stabbing of his second wife Adele Morales, eventually detailing his maelstrom of a cinema-verité film, 1970’s <em>Maidstone</em>, his tête-à-tête with the Feminist movement, 1971’s <em>Town Bloody Hall</em>, the 1981 murder scandal involving ex-convict Jack Henry Abbott, and many, many controversies before and after. Mailer was, for good and ill, an electrifying individual and <em>How to Come Alive</em> offsets the static conventionality of the cradle-to-grave narrative by arranging itself around his seven guiding “rules” or principles for “coming alive”—e.g., “Don’t Be a Nice Jewish Boy from Brooklyn,” “Be Wrong More Often than You’re Right,” “Be Willing to Die for an Idea.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My feeling is nobody said writers had to be nice,” Mailer says in voice-over. “I’m not interested in having people think the way I think but that they get better in the way they think… We’re learning to have a false sense of what we know because of how easily the information comes.” Ever piqued and guided by Mailer’s words, what emerges is a complex portrait of a man in perpetual rebellion, battling the often violent contradictory forces in himself and the stultifying tendencies of American consumerism and recurrent moral panic. After the stunning success of <em>The Naked and the Dead,</em> which made him a bestseller at the age of twenty-five, he proceeded to feint left whenever he was expected to go right—like the boxers he so revered—upsetting the literary status quo with his commitment to visceral depictions of American hypocrisy, the primacy of sex and violence, and a narrative self-obsession that would eventually reinvigorate the complacency of mid-century American literature with 1968’s Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Armies of the Night</em>, the apotheosis of the burgeoning New Journalism. Featured throughout <em>How to Come Alive</em> is cogent commentary by all of Mailer’s children, his surviving sister, his surviving ex-wives, and his many friends, fellow writers, critics, and filmmakers, including James Wolcott, Oliver Stone, Jonathan Lethem, and Germaine Greer. “Romantically reckless,” offers Gay Talese, “that was Norman.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Like his writing, Mailer demands absolute engagement, and the cinema is the only place to immerse yourself to the proper degree. His thorny, often paradoxical lines of thinking simply cannot be reckoned with when one eye is on the screen and the other is on your phone while you’re spraddled on your bog of a couch. Zimbalist’s bold visual juxtapositions work very much in the Mailer vein, like when the passage of Rojack murdering his wife from 1965’s <em>An American Dream </em>is complemented by fireworks bursting in the night sky; while all throughout clips and stills after clips and stills (perhaps no writer in history was so exhaustingly captured on film) are deftly edited so that the twentieth century is raised to Mailer’s voltage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The documentary is weakest, however, as it draws to a close, when it tries to wrap its many parts into a convenient summary for our day. First, it lingers while rhapsodizing the reformed old lion, the “elder statesman of letters” who’d mellowed with age and made peace with his many sins, the darling of his massive brood. We are assured that he never forgave himself for stabbing his wife, although as an artist he had no choice but to double down (as he did with <em>An American Dream</em>, which he began to write less than three years later). There is little assessment of the final novels—sometimes downright shoddy, and whose compensating merits remain debatable—simply casting them as evidence of his everlasting engagement with “titanic” subjects like Ancient Egypt, Jesus, and Hitler. Curiously, there’s no mention of “The White Negro,” his highly controversial essay on the violent hipster type (which sparked a whole new uproar last year around a scheduled collection of his essays intended to commemorate his centennial; the collection was shelved). And where are the barbs from <em>anyone</em> even tangentially related to any of the many people he feuded with—a brand of trial by fire he practically basked in?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as the kids gather around his deathbed and old, mute Mailer’s eyes are described as lighting up with a twinkle when he takes one last sip of rum and orange juice, you can’t help but feel moisture welling up at the lower punctums. Then comes the predictably sententious rallying cry against “cancel culture,” which, while a genuine annoyance, is an essentially lazy term at this point, and one that lends itself too easily as a sort of Frankenstein creature for the Right to animate with a farrago of the Left’s fixations and preoccupations. It’s a squandered opportunity to use the subject to make Mailer <em>new</em>, to wake us up with another Maileresque one-two-three punch combo. Neither Mailer—nor Orwell for that matter—would recycle a phrase as hackneyed as “cancel culture” to decry one of the many ticks clinging to the buttocks of public discourse.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">So why Norman? Zimbalist credits Mailer’s prescience of the pitfalls of modern civilization, along with his singular, unabashed courage to offer creative—if extravagant—solutions as being of singular usefulness today. Mailer repelled reductive, singular definitions and it’s his extravagance of spirit that is clearly the film’s guiding light. “I hope,” Zimbalist revealed after the screening, “it can serve as a sort of litmus test for finding the limits you’re comfortable with.” “A cautionary tale,” the subtitle reads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In many ways, watching a film where Mailer rationalizes his thoughts and behaviors in the face of contemporary America’s onslaught of cheapness, its obsession with an almost lobotomized pragmatism that itself is a mechanical oppression, reminded me why it’s perhaps useful I have yet to “outgrow” my own anger, my unwillingness to excuse America’s inability to live up to the lofty ideals it set for itself. If you believe in them, you expect accountability. “I’ve lost respect for it,” Mailer said in a 1999 BBC documentary, “I sit there in a certain unhappiness with respect to my country. It has not become as great and as noble as I’ve wanted it to become.” And so we cannot accept indefinitely the placebo of “consumer choice” in exchange for this constant traducing, sullying, exploiting, and downgrading of democracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When we just feel a dull depression, it’s very hard to love. It’s that nice mixture of love and anger that we need to come alive,” Mailer advises. And coming alive, as the film suggests, is to be instinctively aware that the business of life is not in the act of being, but in the persistent friction of becoming.</p>

<p><strong>The first thing you think when you walk into Pappy and Harriet’s</strong>, after a winding, desolate drive up Pioneertown Road, is: Where the hell did all these beautiful people come from? And where did they all get their flat-brimmed cowboy hats and brand-new boots? And what about this guy in an octopus-print wizard’s robe?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Pioneertown itself—an unincorporated, Western-themed community of less than five hundred—couldn’t fill this storied venue. Nor would its residents want to. People move to Pioneertown to get away, not to mingle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about this girl with the subtle nose job? What about this couple discussing stock options? And what about this guy selling individually-wrapped MDMA and psilocybin chocolates?&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where did they all come from?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The obvious answer, of course, is Los Angeles—the same place as your correspondent. They’ve driven hours for a sold-out, Saturday night edition of André 3000’s <em>New Blue Sun</em> <em>Live</em>. Dozens of tightly-clutched cans of Liquid Death attest to that. And after a months-long postponement, they’re ready for the show.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the more complicated answer is: they came from California.</p>

<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When André 3000 released <em>A New Blue Sun</em> (2023), it left many listeners baffled. At least, it baffled those that hadn’t noticed the artist dropping in on Prospect Park drum circles and practicing his flute in airports over the past several years. Not to say the album’s reviews were unfavorable—critics from <em>Rolling Stone</em> to <em>Pitchfork</em> called it “a breath of fresh incense,” and some of the year’s “best new music.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it was a change of pace for the iconoclastic, once-and-future rapper. As one half of the hip-hop duo OutKast, André 3000 is the rare musician whose cultural clout hasn’t faded in his time away from the mic. If anything, the group’s inimitable sound still informs the dirty south rap style it both defined and transcended.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Born in Atlanta, André 3000 (né Benjamin) met OutKast’s other half—Antwan “Big Boi” Patton—in 1992. They were both sixteen, and in tenth grade. Two years later, they’d gone platinum with their debut album, <em>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</em>, and only kept going up. Their seminal double release—2003's <em>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</em>—remains the best-selling hip-hop record of all time.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In your correspondent’s first year of high school, it was impossible to turn on the radio without hearing one of its singles. “Hey Ya!” and “Roses” were so inescapable that no car ride was free from exposure. In less than a decade, OutKast—and especially André 3000—had gone from curiosities to culture-shifting icons that brought Southern rap into the mainstream. Looking back twenty years later, after what many have called André’s “flute album,” it’s hard to overstate the man’s immense and enduring popularity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, when you find him in the high desert, playing 90-minute sets of free jazz and speaking in tongues, it’s also hard not to ask: What the hell happened?</p>

<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometime around the pandemic, André 3000 moved to Los Angeles, dropping four million dollars on a place in Venice Beach. Originally, this was supposed to be a temporary move. A “six-month sort of thing.” Just a little space to get his head sorted out. But, as fate would have it, the artist went to Erewhon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Angelenos’ obsession with Erewhon—and Lassens, and Bristol Farms, and all manner of virtue-signaling grocers and superfood suppliers—borders on the absurd. It’s also low-hanging, organic, cruelty-free, non-GMO fruit for the city’s critics.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not long after your correspondent moved to LA, a date pointed out an “<em>amazing</em>” local chain, explaining that its name was “nowhere” spelled backwards. After glancing at its sign, your correspondent told her that “Erewhon” was an anagram of “nowhere,” rather than its reverse. There weren’t many dates after that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>André’s experience was more fortuitous. He ran into Carlos Niño—a producer, percussionist, and elder statesman of the LA experimental and healing music scenes—and hit it off. Hours later, he was at an Alice Coltrane tribute, flute in-hand, ready to jam. He’d picked up his interest in woodwinds a couple years before, at a breathwork class put on by a professional surfer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If all of this feels unbearably Californian, that’s because it is. Venice—an aborted resort town and former artists’ enclave—still clings to the tattered shreds of its bohemian credentials: Mid-century Venice Beach played host to Lawrence Lipton’s “Holy Barbarians”—Beat poets and artists who found refuge in the “Slum by the Sea.” Now, it’s a peculiar nexus of designer boutiques, one-bed bungalows, reiki masters, homeless encampments, NIMBYs, yoga studios, “wellness” centers, open-air skateparks, closed-door tech startups, and million-dollar celebrity renovations.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is, in other words, Californian.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the live show, you see and hear a lot of flutes (and other wind instruments). There are Mayan flutes, Mesquite flutes, Bolivian flutes, Native American drone flutes, and at least one pan flute. Some are custom flutes, made by Guillermo Martinez at the Silverado-based Quetzalcoatl Music, unique to André 3000. Others are more standard—if such a word can be used for instruments like soprano oboes, Roland Aerophones, and repurposed bird calls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At times, this can come off like an exhibition of musical memorabilia. André changes instruments every few minutes as the music swells and subsides, looking for sounds that fit the moment. But it works. The performance is mesmerizing, the musicians in sync, and the compositions ethereal—though not too celestial to get lost in. Even if the audience doesn’t know when to clap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Halfway through, the artist takes some time between songs to introduce the band. He also uses the time to describe this new direction, to answer the unasked questions, as if he feels the need to explain himself. There’s a tension between his Atlanta roots and his Californian dreaming, his lingering Southern accent and his shout-outs to Erehwon (at this point, everyone knows to clap).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answers to some of these questions can be found with the band itself. There’s Niño—with whom André co-produced the new album—and Deantoni Parks on drums, Nate Mercereau on guitar, and Surya Botofasina on a battery of flanged-out keyboards. And Botofasina may be the key to understanding where <em>New Blue Sun</em>—and all these people in Pioneertown—came from.</p>

<p>In interviews with GQ and NPR, André provides a list of inspirations. The list is fairly predictable: Phillip Glass, Yusuf Lateef, John Coltrane. But Coltrane has a special connection to the project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alice Coltrane—John’s wife, and a pioneering jazz musician herself—shared her husband’s religious reverence for music. After his death, she opened the Sai Anantam Ashram in the Santa Monica Mountains. Although it closed in 2017, its website still notes that it was dedicated to “not only Vedic scriptures,” but also “more recent revelations of God.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(For those not as familiar as your correspondent with what passes for normal on the West Coast: An ashram is a place of spiritual seclusion inspired by Indian religious traditions. While this might sound like a strange way to grow up, it’s surprisingly common in America.)</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As it happens, Surya Botofasina was raised on that same ashram.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his <em>Rolling Stone</em> review, Christopher Weingarten calls <em>New Blue Sun </em>“a peak in the decade-long crescendo of hipsterati new age revival.” But this crescendo has been building for much longer than a decade. <em>New Blue Sun</em>’s cultural moment reflects the slow creep of Californian New Age ideas, aesthetics, and practices into mainstream culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New Age is notoriously (and perhaps intentionally) difficult to define. If your correspondent were to try, it’s a kind of holistic, pay-as-you-go, self-centered pantheism. A worldview in which no one can tell you what to believe, but a few thousand dollars and a shaman in Hawaii or Big Sur might point you in the right direction. Since the 1970s, it has been the milieu that creative Californians operate in, the water they swim in, the air they breathe. The same can now be said of many Americans. California has quietly invaded the rest of the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is the California of the Esalen Institute, of astrological readings and plant medicines, of self-actualization and transcendental meditation. Of natural wines and light-based therapies. Of Kamasi Washington and Thundercat. This California is both a state and a state of mind. A state where they beatified John Coltrane—but not before declaring him God incarnate first. Where people don’t strive for a better life—they “manifest” one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its influence can be seen as far back as OutKast’s third album (1998’s <em>Aquemini</em>). That two Atlanta-based rappers, fresh out of high school, would even think of using star signs to identify themselves shows how deeply New Age ideas permeated American culture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the GQ interview, André looks back on OutKast’s success from a Venice Beach laundromat. He remembers their surprise win for “best new rap group” at the 1995 Source Awards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Our contemporaries were looking at us crazy. Like, ‘who are y’all? Y’all are from another planet.’ Now the planet is here.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your correspondent sometimes refers to California as “another planet,” meaning both its quirky people and its sublime landscapes. Hearing this echoed back from the artist, a few years after his move, feels like confirmation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Conservatives often decry Hollywood’s control over social narratives. But it is this long-simmering set of beliefs, exported via counter-cultural fads—think crystal-toting yogis and gluten-free chiropractors—that has subtly shifted collective myth-making over the past fifty years. If you check Surya Botofasina’s website, his bio notes that he’s based in New York, but “metaphysically always in his Beloved California.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increasingly, this is the metaphysical space many Americans inhabit. When you scratch the surface, New Age is everywhere you look. Mormons rely on essential oils in lieu of medications. Celebrity lifestyle brands hawk plant-based supplements. And insurrectionists like <a href=""https://harpers.org/archive/2024/04/jacobs-dream/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jacob Chansley</a>—a man most wouldn’t recognize without a painted face and a coyote-tail headdress—promote quantum woo and describe extraterrestrial encounters.</p>

<p>André 3000 has long understood the importance of presentation, of style, of toying with signifiers and recycling them for his own ends. In his early years, he reinvigorated Afrofuturist fashion–donning shoulder pads and feather boas, golden <em>chaquetillas</em> and catchers’ vests–and moved it squarely into the mainstream of American culture. As much as OutKast defined the turn-of-the-century Atlanta sound, André 3000 set the tone for avant-garde Black fashion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, when the artist takes a left turn into new age jazz, you should pay attention to the style. To the set dressing. To the signifiers you can’t quite place. While his own stage presence has mellowed over the years—this June Saturday in the desert he’s wearing all black, a red beanie, and his now-signature Coke bottle glasses—hints of his sense for the surreal, the almost extra-terrestrial, come through in the scenography.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between the echoing cymbal crescendos, the intrepid bird call solos, and the rustle of palm fronds, you notice what look like heat lamps, pointed at the audience from backstage. Color-changing LEDs ring their shades, slowly pulsing with the music. But there’s something else–something in front of André and the others—that's been there since before the crowd arrived.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just off-center, stage left, is a white traffic cone. A half-filled highball glass sits on top. On stage right, a featureless black box projects a laser through the glass, its refracted beam glimmering in the water. In the middle of all this improvisation, there is a very deliberate installation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>The aliens are here. And they’re Californian.</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">None of this is ever explained, let alone acknowledged. But with an artist like André 3000, you wonder: What does it mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is this the titular <em>New Blue Sun</em>? A focused, coherent, inherently technological form of light, passing through the essential medium of life? And what about the white traffic cone? Even its lack of color feels like it means something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the show progresses, the LEDs shift through the spectrum, eventually landing on blue. Backlit by the same color, the laser becomes white. Dust speckles the beam, blown and kicked up from the desert floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is every transmission, every sound wave and song and polarized photon, bound to be disrupted by nature? Is there no such thing as white light—only our biologically-limited perspective of color and its absence?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his NPR interview, André gives a very New-Agey answer to the question of the title, talking about “new worlds” and “new beings.” But if the music is improvisational, why can’t the meanings be? If the songs are different every time, shouldn’t your interpretations be as well?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some ways, Pioneertown is the perfect place for <em>New Blue Sun Live</em>. Nearby Joshua Tree has long had a reputation for being “where hippie meets redneck,” where New Age ideas meet the unforgiving glare of the rest of America. It’s no coincidence that the Integratron—a Mecca for SoCal sound baths, steeped in its own New Age mythos—is a twenty-minute drive from Pappy and Harriet’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because, despite the over-representation of LA, there are locals in this crowd. Priced out of LA, many artists and musicians have decamped for the Morongo Basin. Star-seeking restaurants and bars have popped up on Old Woman Springs Road. So, you’re not surprised when you overhear a biker discussing tarot pulls by the bathroom, or when the bartender mentions their rising sign.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two people pass out towards the end of the show, with André directing security to the unconscious onlookers. Whether this is from the music or the candied hallucinogens is unclear. The artist, for his part, takes it in stride. After he’s sure the second fainter is alright, he laughs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Damn. Ya’ll tryin’ to go to heaven early tonight.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The audience cheers. People <em>are</em> looking for rapture tonight—including the people on stage. The band radiates a kind of joy in the craft that many high-performing musicians lack. There’s no competition here. Only seeking. Searching for the perfect groove. The perfect vibe. And as André reminds everyone, the vibe will be different every time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you go into a <em>New Blue Sun Live</em> show expecting to hear the new album, you’ll be disappointed. This is improvisational. Music for the moment, of the moment, by the moment. And there’s no disappointment in that. Even if you question its motivations. But if you showed up to Pioneertown expecting everything to go according to plan, wolfing down mushroom chocolates and drinking mezcal, wearing a cowboy hat as the stars poke through indigo skies, maybe you deserve disappointment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the night, as André takes a bow and skips any pretense of an encore, you look back on the performance for what it was: a handful of talented musicians, jamming in the desert. In this moment, what else can you ask for?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>It’s grain filling season in Illinois.</strong> All around me, the corn fields are having sex, and lots of it. Those are the words that Brian, the Free Methodist sitting next to me on the train to Chicago, uses to describe the fertilization of corn husks. “The tassel (the male part of the corn) pollinates the ovules on the ear (the female).” I look outside my window and see the never-ending fields of corn on either side of the train. “You’re telling me these fields are making love,” I ask, because I don’t know much about agriculture, and I’m trying to find my feet in the conversation. “That’s right,” Brian says. “This is the stronghold of American corn.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the kind of conversation you can only have on a train. We’ve been talking since he got on at Lincoln and I asked him about corn, which seemed like an appropriate thing to ask a guy with a Nutrien sticker on his laptop in the middle of Illinois. “I’ve got corn and soybeans in my blood,” he said. He’s not lying. His ancestors, he tells me, farmed corn in the east of the state for 200 years. His grandfather did some early work in GMO corn seeds: “Bigger bushels means more kernels, which means a higher yield.” His father had the farm until he was sent to Korea. On the subject of pesticides, which is Brian’s line of work, he tells me about Roundup, which I’ve seen pilots spray from planes over these fields to keep the insects off. “If an insect bites into a stalk that’s been sprayed,” Brian says, not quite cheerfully, “its stomach will explode.” “Like a bomb,” I say, and Brian nods. “Those aerial sprayers earn their keep.” It’s a dangerous job. “I came back here for my father’s funeral,” he says, “and in the cemetery, three graves along, there was a guy—thirty-two years old—who was spraying crops. He flew into the powerlines.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tell him I write for this magazine and I’m on my way to Chicago to see what’s going on at the DNC, if it’ll be anything like 1968, when the police had iron fists and the Yippies, fed up with war drafts and a Democratic Party keen on staying in Vietnam, nominated Lyndon Pigasus Pig—a real pig—for president. “Be careful,” he says, and proceeds to tell me that he’s not afraid to talk about politics, even when I invite him not to: “I’m going to vote for the best person for the job. But I do have one non-negotiable,” he says, and his eyes get that Free Methodist glaze. “I don’t believe in taking the life of an unborn child.” Naturally, our conversation dries up, but not before he tells me about Jesus, who died for his sins, and Boise, Idaho, where he lives now: “It’s the kind of state where you can play golf in the morning and ski in the afternoon. We’ve got it all, you see.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the last part of the journey, we turn to our laptops, and when I’m not writing, I peek at his screen and see numerical tables of corn markets, corn prices, and corn futures. When the train’s automated voice says, “Next stop, Chicago,” I’m on Instagram looking at an AI-generated video montage of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. In the first scene Trump and Harris are holding hands and walking on a beach. In the second scene they’re kissing on a stage in front of an audience. In the third, Harris is pregnant, and Trump is rubbing her baby bump.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll be in Chicago in about forty minutes. My first stop: a cobbler outside Union Station, who I’ve paid $7.00 to store my backpack for four hours. Then, the protests in Union Park, where, according to the organizers’ press release, “tens of thousands” are expected to “amass” for the “March on the DNC for Palestine.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""unindented"">People are amassing in front of the porta potties. There are seven porta potties for what looks like a crowd of 10,000 protestors. The line for the loo is so long, so perfectly straight and single file, it cuts through Union Park, parting the people like a bowsprit. If everyone keeps drinking the free bottled water being handed out by people in yellow vests, the back of the line could reach the stage on the other side of the park, where speakers are asking Killer Kamala if she’s thought about not sending weapons to Israel. “Right now,” says the speaker on stage, “hundreds of war criminals are in Chicago to celebrate themselves.” She goes on: “Today, at the DNC, the keynote speaker is Genocide Joe.” A few minutes ago, I picked up our press passes. One for Sosnowski, who’s on his way, and one for me. Having it means we can stand a bit closer to the stage, if we want to.</p>

<p>Stacks of placards lie here and there on the grass, ready for people to pick up at will when the march begins. They remind me of gardening tools.

<p>There appear to be more porta potties in the park than there are flags of Israel. There, on the outer perimeter along Washington Boulevard, I see a small Israeli counter-protest taking place. They are ensconced in such a strange part of the park, away from everything and shielded by the police, that it seems as though they fell out of the sky and landed there by mistake. They’re flying six stars of David. Around them, Pro-Palestine supporters are asking if they haven’t got anything better to do on a Monday afternoon. Police everywhere, including Superintendent Snelling.</p>

Both of his arms are very long, like the hose on a vacuum cleaner, and he has blood on his hands. His neck appears to be a broomstick. “Fuck you, Netanyahu,” says a guy with a motorbike helmet on his head when the puppet passes him by. “We want <em>Palestine</em> to win.”</p>

<p>I’m talking to a cop with a short, red-haired woman named Patty. Patty saw me taking a video of the Christians standing outside the First Baptist Congregational Church on the corner of Ashland and Washington, on the east end of the park. I was trying to document people’s interactions with their banners, one of which reads, “Christians: Jesus will vomit you out of his mouth” (it’s from the Bible, <em>Revelation</em> 3:16). Not from the Bible is what one Christian is yelling at a pro-Palestine protestor across the street: “God’s got his finger on you, you little perv!” Patty asked me if I’d be a witness while she asked the police if the Christians had a permit to say those kinds of things. There are better ideas in the world, but at least she had plenty of police to talk to.</p>

<p>Sosnowski is here. We are standing where the Jesus congregation was calling everyone a pervert. This is where the march begins. As the protestors take their place in the street, superintendent Snelling holds a rapid-fire press conference in the middle of the intersection. I’m so close to him I can see the four silver stars on his shirt collar. A reporter asks, “What’s your biggest fear for today?” Snelling says, “I have no fears.” A few minutes later, the march begins, and Sosnowski and I disappear.</p>

<p><em>“With Nixon as the only alternative, Kennedy was beautiful—whatever he was. It didn’t matter. The most important thing about Kennedy, to me and millions of others was that his name wasn’t Nixon. Far more than Stevenson, he hinted at the chance for a new world—a whole new scale of priorities, from the top down. Looking at Kennedy on the stump, it was possible to conceive of a day when a man younger than 70 might enter the White House as a welcome visitor, on his own terms.” — Hunter S.

<p><strong>At 38,000 feet, the heady atmosphere</strong> produced by thin recycled air and travel nausea makes it easier to view the world below as something more akin to a memory palace, a phantasmagoria, a collection of shifting plates whose surfaces morph like ChromaFlair, where the same dramas play out in perpetuity but with different actors playing the key roles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The night prior, despite my pending red eye to Chicago, I found I needed a “last meal” at a tavern in the dark woods of Montrose, a little community near Pasadena’s mysterious Jet Propulsion Laboratory some fifteen miles north of my apartment. It seemed fitting in an odd sort of way, for I didn’t know whether or not I would be returning from Chicago with permanent scars—psychic or otherwise. The meal took on a compulsive form of importance, like symbolism, like a handshake from someone dear before crossing a threshold. I knew I’d be too hopped up to sleep anyhow. Faced with the prospect, however slim, of stepping into history itself carried enough electric energy to send me back to those raw frequencies of childhood, when the knowledge of any and every divergence from the routine carried a strong hint of the miraculous.</p>

<p>Now, aboard American Airlines flight 1021—LAX to Chicago O’Hare—I wonder if anyone else has similar thoughts bouncing around their sleep-deprived head. None of the passengers appear any different or more aware. Today is simply another Monday morning, six a.m. flight to anyplace, U.S.A. Maybe the one man with three hats on his head (two straw cowboy hats with a baseball cap on top) or the one guy partial to the spirit of the Yippies (in Birkenstocks, with long curly hair, scruffy beard, and a very late ‘60s bandana wrapped around his forehead). Is it ego or something else that carries this impulse of mine—likely borne from a sense of pure fear—to self-mythologize in the face of the unknown, to step upon the shifting plates of the present acutely aware they are shifting?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I re-read the press release for the March on the DNC for Palestine that will mark the first protest of the convention. I’d been struggling to come to terms with an approach. I find myself ever trapped in a bitter struggle between the temptations of cynicism and the tenderness of hope. Granting access to practically all recorded history, the Internet has had the unintended effect of allowing the past to take on ever larger proportions, proportions which bury the present in a redundancy of images. When I saw the Kamala Harris poster that reads “Forward,” designed like Shepard Fairey’s iconic Obama, it struck me as a facsimile of a facsimile. Buried under these daily sensations, the near past takes on the mythic proportions of ancient history, except it wears the veneer of something fabricated, something like cheap knockoffs in the manner of the “smart” wear H&amp;M hocks to last only the length of the gig. All the media’s comparisons to 1968, to 1996, to anything and everything, predicated the bizarre feeling that whatever was going to happen today, this week—especially the protests—just wouldn’t live up to the hype. In this moment, I want to believe history is the imprint of footsteps on wet concrete instead of wet sand, but would I recognize the difference given the chance?</p>

<p>The captain announces we are 40 minutes from landing. The anticipation of witnessing a Great American City rise up out of the vast midwestern flats begins to build. I put my reading away and focus on the picture outside my window. The Boeing 737 careens through gargantuan clouds with a shudder as it adjusts course and descends. Bit by bit grids and serpentine networks of suburban housing developments break apart the loamy fields. Baseball diamonds, playgrounds, ponds, and swamps. The green gaps shorten as the human footprint expands—industrial parks and expansive facilities, the interstate widens lane by lane with ever more elaborate interchanges. We soar over an Amtrak train chugging along, eastward, eastward, until out of the hazy mists on the distant horizon, the city appears like a charcoal mirage.</p>

<p><strong>Initial impressions of Chicago:</strong> the Blue line rattles and whistles its way along the median of Interstate 90 toward the city. A billboard reads “The Future Is Built in Chicago.” I transfer to the Brown line “L” elevated train in the Loop and catch the architectural spectacle on full display. We cross the Chicago River, where the sequence of iron bascule (or “seesaw”) bridges stretch away either side of ours like ruddy hurdles. Towers of steel and concrete in neo-Gothic, Art Deco, Modernist, and International styles loom over everything. I admire the voyeuristic, Edward Hopper-esque view the elevated trains offer, like an amusement park ride through some cardboard city. Elevateds, like commuter trains, offer you a look at the back ends of things—fire escapes, back doors, junk-strewn yards, pipe networks, and people (when you can catch a glimpse) with their guards down.</p>

<p class=""indented"">The towers get shorter as we travel into the North Side. In <em>Miami and the Siege of Chicago,</em> Norman Mailer compared Chicago to Brooklyn in a way I now see makes great sense—Chicago as the Brooklyn of fulfilled potential had it not been sacrificed to its inexorably luminous sibling across the East River:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">...neighborhoods which dripped with the sauce of local legend, and real city architecture, brownstones with different windows on every floor, vistas for miles of red-brick and two-family wood-frame houses with balconies and porches, runty stunted trees rich as farmland in their promise of tenderness the first city evenings of spring, streets where kids played stick-ball and roller-hockey, lots of smoke and iron twilight. The clangor of the late nineteenth century...</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Chicago also evades comparison. It’s been over 50 years since<em> Siege of Chicago, </em>and yet so much seems unchanged, even the proliferation of new steel, glass, and updated construction techniques appear integrated in a harmonious way, following the lead set in the late nineteenth century when Chicago’s vengeful quest for beauty reigned. I disembark at Fullerton Station and stroll through the collegiate, richly arboreous streets of Lincoln Park to drop my bags off and reset. It is warm, but not unpleasant. I feel closer to the South than the West, as the humidity lines my brow with beads of sweat and the cicadas roar in the tall trees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My co-correspondent is already in the thick of it. Having arrived a while earlier, O’Brien went straight to Union Park where the “March on the DNC for Palestine” protestors were gathering. In the absence of any press credentials whatsoever, O’Brien scores us press passes to the protest. I arrive at Ashland station, walk across the canopied wooden decks flanked by cast iron supports and ornamental rosettes, and descend the resonant stairs behind scores of people in a scene that feels lifted out of the 1930s. Flags, drums, shouts, chants, a sea of people spread across the sun-saturated greenery; reds, greens, whites, and blacks are the palette, keffiyehs and N95 masks the adornments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>O’Brien finds me relatively quickly and hands me my lanyard with a laminated card that reads “Press.” We move toward the stage where the speeches continue as they have all morning. I just miss Cornel West. I nod to a person in a NASCAR baseball cap carrying an “Immigrant Rights For All!” sign. Gathered stage left, a group of Jewish people in Orthodox garb dance signs that read “State of Israel Does Not Represent World Jewry.” Across from the First Baptist Congregational church at the corner of Washington and Ashland, Christian trolls have gathered to decry the licentiousness and hell-bound fervor of the protestors. One in a “Turn or Burn” t-shirt holds up a sign that reads “Jesus Will Vomit You Out of His Mouth.” A spectacularly Christian image pending iconization, I’m sure of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Union Park, the first park to be racially integrated in the city, is in Chicago’s near West Side, a once low-income neighborhood undergoing rapid gentrification, as evidenced by the tall fresh apartment blocks that scream “rooftop natural wine party under the string lights.” We start a conversation with an elderly man named Melvin who tells us we’re basically “in the hood, but you wouldn’t know it today.” I tell him I thought that was the South side. He says there’s a hood on every side. He grew up just up the street, at the Henry Horner Homes, a project on the east side of United Center, and coached a lot of basketball players who graduated to the NBA. “Jordan. He wasn’t shit. All free throws. Look at the stats. He had a referee who looked out for him in like 80% of his playoff games.” Melvin’s guarding the generator today for his friend’s electrical company, but he says he’s retired. “Diesel. If someone messed with this thing it’d blow sky high.” He points a few more things out in different directions. “The whole neighborhood is changing,” he muses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pressure mounts as protesters begin to line up on the park side of Washington Boulevard. The police are <em>everywhere</em>, on bicycles, on foot, lining perimeters nearby and in the distance. They have fixed, immovable faces. Adults of all ethnicities, all ages. Another class of cops stand in the center of the intersection; they wear peaked cap officer’s hats and white button-ups. They are larger, bulkier, harder-seeming in every conceivable way—like a breed of man built for intimidation—with faces chiseled from granite, unrelenting, implacable, features stolen from statues and busts. Who are these men? Do the men forge the force or does the force forge the men? The press swarm around them and the one who steps forward, with a chin that could split wood, is Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">O’Brien puts his voice recorder into the swirl of bodies. One reporter asks, “Do you have any fears for the day?” “We have no fears,” Snelling responds. “We’re just focused on getting the job done.” When the impromptu conference breaks, there’s some signal and the ground cops mount their bicycles one-by-one, kicking off with an unexpected sort of grace and swinging a leg over like they’re cavalry. We follow the onrush of photographers to the sidewalks of Washington and climb onto some scaffolding for a better view of the oncoming marchers. “Palestine will be free! (<em>Palestine will be free!</em>) From the river to the sea! (<em>From the river to the sea!</em>)” the refrain goes. “When one of us is under attack, what do we do? (<em>We fight back!</em>)” The woman leading the chorus has fire in her vocal chords, hypnotizing passion. Deep drums complement her alto calls. She wears a white, gray, and black keffiyeh wrapped around her head and spins in the center of a circle of people, just behind a set of speakers rigged on wheels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leading up to the trip, I’d felt a real desire to make some—<em>any—</em>sense of this moment in time, of these almost religious urges, in a way that felt appropriate to the level of perceived emotional investment, in this new century when paradigmatic shifts of epic proportions breed more powerlessness and disaffection into millions of young adults. And yet here, as I clutch a diagonal support beam on a Chicago street, everything feels exhibitionistic, beset by a proliferation of cameras and smartphones and bored police officers, with a whole squadron of people on the wings wearing expressionless faces, climbing on objects to make images, and marchers in the middle of the road, leisurely smiling and lifting their signs while basking in the invisible glow of the ever-present lens.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 3:31 pm, we’re back on the Pink Line to pick up O’Brien’s luggage from a cobbler across the street from the Willis Tower before he closes up shop. At the station, CTA workers crack jokes. Onward flows the rest of the world unmoved.</p>

<p><strong>9:40 pm.</strong> We eat sandwiches and drink beers at Halligan’s pub, a wedge-shaped Irish bar on the corner of Orchard and Lincoln. Onscreen, Tim Walz and his wife sit in their box frowning. They will do a lot of that, in between smiles and hand-over-their-hearts gestures. Golden State Warriors (and USA Olympic team) coach Steve Kerr gives a speech, invoking Steph Curry’s “go to sleep” gesture from the Olympic final to call on everyone to put Number 45 to bed. “Do you think he asked to speak or does someone like that get invited?” O’Brien asks. “Big donors, probably,” I say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By 10:22 pm, we wonder how many people actually go for all the sentimentality at these conventions. Some of these participants wouldn’t do half-bad on a well-scripted TV drama or romance. Finally, President Biden is summoned by his daughter where he takes in a four-and-a-half minute ovation, lips parted, eyes glossy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually, we will rejoin the night. When we do, it is crisp, with a steady wind blowing from the lake, everywhere a scent of moisture and wet earth. We march down Webster to Lincoln Park, looking for the ghosts of Yippies asleep in the park. We try guessing the statues. (Neither of us gets Hans Christian Andersen.) We stop at the bridge over South Pond, transfixed by the scene. The sky is fluorescent with the blue supermoon; great clouds drift swiftly across, glowing temporarily, like electric jellyfish, over the tops of the incandescent skyscrapers. “Hotel Lincoln” shines in red neon to the southwest. In front of us, at the center of the bridge, are two people seated on chairs in front of a laptop, their faces lit by a ring light, a cameraman behind it in the darkness; they are silent, frozen. Minutes pass without speaking, without movement, only the ripples of the South Pond below, shimmering. I’ve never seen anything like it. I watch O’Brien run over to the man seated on a bench nearby. He returns. “DNC coverage. Channel 3. Madison, Wisconsin.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">We stop at Ulysses S. Grant’s monument. Pass the Garibaldi monument. “There,” he says, taking off toward a decline in the path toward the underpass beneath La Salle Drive, “that’s where the Yippies got tear gas in their eyes in ‘68.” In the meantime I spy Benjamin Franklin’s iconic silhouette on his pedestal. “Genet said the cops came down this hill here, and this,” O’Brien gestures around us like a madman, “this is where all hell breaks loose. And now, 56 years later, it’s empty! Not a soul around.” “Well it’s just the first day,” I offer. “It was the first day then, too,” he pants. We watch the cars on La Salle hit Clark. “Netflix,” I shrug.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When we walk into The Corner Bar </strong>in Chicago’s North Side, Sosnowski and I discover something about Kamala Harris: She’s not in Chicago. According to the live broadcast on the only TV above the bar, she’s in Milwaukee. Now, some people will argue that it is the responsibility of political correspondents to know the whereabouts of the Vice President of the United States, especially when she’s up for promotion. But we are not political correspondents, and the fact that we didn’t know Kamala Harris would be rallying in Milwaukee while her employers were rallying in Chicago is more a reflection of our failure to anticipate the ambition of the Democratic Party: they’ll do anything to split a TV screen in half.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we watch Bernie Sanders on stage in one city alongside Kamala Harris on stage in another, Sosnowski and I realize that we’ll do anything for a meal. The Corner Bar doesn’t serve food, so we tell the bartender we’ll be back and we walk to the tavern at the end of the street. I am sometimes afflicted by the need to ask questions that don’t need to be asked, and when we walk inside the tavern I ask the bartender if they serve food. “This is a restaurant,” he says, and points to the host sitting outside. “She’ll seat you.” But she won’t. The kitchen is closing in 15 minutes, and two big parties have just sat down ahead of us. “You’re looking at an hour wait time,” the host says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With no TV in the tavern, we’d miss the Obamas, so we go in search of something quicker. There’s a taqueria nearby. I make the mistake of not checking the prices on the menu before walking in, so I end up paying $17.00 for two tacos. They’re delicious— “Chef,” says Sosnowski, imitating a character on <em>The Bear</em>, “the texture of every grain of rice is perfect”—and we return to The Corner Bar with carnitas in our system. The streets are darker now, and on our way we see blue rectangles glowing behind the open windows in the houses on Leavitt Street: Everyone, it seems, is watching the DNC.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No one’s watching that shit,” a guy at the bar says to his friend when we sit down and look up at the TV. Senator Tammy Duckworth is addressing the crowd, but we don’t know what she’s saying because there’s no volume on the TV and the remote, handed to us by the bartender, offers no clear path to closed captions. By the time Doug Emhoff takes the stage and tells us he drank Slurpees after Little League practice when he was a kid, I’ve brought up another live stream of the convention on my phone and propped it against a straw holder on the bar. If I hadn’t acted so quickly, we’d have missed one of Emhoff’s big revelations: He named his first fantasy football league “Nirvana.”&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Michelle Obama takes the stage and tells us “Something wonderfully magic is in the air, isn’t it,” someone in the bar is playing “American Pie” on the jukebox. Thus, it is to the sound of Don McClean’s eulogy for a lost past that we hear/read Michelle Obama talk about the promises of America’s future:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">We’re feeling it here in this arena, but it’s spreading all across this country we love. A familiar feeling that’s been buried far too deep and for far too long. You know what I’m talking about. It’s the contagious power of hope. The anticipation, the energy, the exhilaration of once again being on the cusp of a brighter day. The chance to vanquish the demons of fear, division, and hate that have consumed us and continue pursuing the unfinished promise of this great nation. The dream that our parents and grandparents fought for and died and sacrificed for. America, hope is making a comeback.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">At all the right moments in the former first lady's speech, the camera swivels to the faces in the crowd at the United Center, bringing us a stadium vision of the cheering, vibrating mass, then zooming in on individual faces to see their blazing eyes, eyes ecstatic, eyes agog with wonder and reverence for her message of recycled hope.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it’s the close ups on people’s eyes, streamed to me on two screens in this small Chicago bar where Sosnowski and I are watching, that lead me to an idea: I don’t know how they’ve done it, but the Democratic Party has found a way to wash their hands of Israel and Gaza for a few hopeful days, days that promise to turn into weeks and months and maybe even years. Somehow, with Harris and Walz in Milwaukee, the Democratic Party has found the words to remind the good citizens of America that their party always has been, and always will be, the Party of Hope. Just look at those faces cheering for the Obamas, faces lifted and lulled by blue light and blue words. We can’t hear the convention on the TV in The Corner Bar, but I know the cheers in the United Center are loud. So loud that, if I listened to them long enough, I, too, could forget the sounds of American bombs falling on Gaza.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Barack takes the stage, not only is Hope making a comeback, but so too is his 2008 campaign slogan, updated and refreshed for a Hopeless moment. “Yes, she can,” he says of Kamala Harris. “Yes, she can.”</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>I haven’t stayed in a hostel in over twelve years.</strong> The arrangement is, as I recalled, very European. And from what I can tell, it’s populated mostly by foreign travelers. Harmonious and courteous, strangers maneuver in silent sync at breakfast. No one calls the manager. If I can’t think of the last time I witnessed this much civility in a large room, perhaps America isn’t, in fact, “winning” (winning at what?), as President Biden so emphatically put it in his <em>Goodnight, Sweet World, Goodnight</em> speech on night one of the DNC. Of course, the dark vision conjured by the other side of the partisan line is a waste of imaginative faculties. Yet, I’d like to think this civility is a key component of the “social” in the socialism many Americans are allergic to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m in a contemplative mood again and despite President Biden having summoned a lot of his best attributes to deliver a rousing speech, there are a lot of contrasting tensions and emotions that obscure a clear view, like trying to see out your windshield while racing down a highway at night through a storm of bugs. In 1970, George E. Reedy, a former member of LBJ’s inner circle, published <em>The Twilight of the Presidency</em>. In it, he makes the following point:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The basic question is not whether we have devised structures with inadequate authority for the decision-making process. The question is whether the structures have created an environment in which men cannot function in any kind of decent and humane relationship to the people they are supposed to lead. I am afraid—and on this point I am a pessimist—that we have devised that kind of system.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Depending on a number of determining factors, your mood might swing between an acknowledgement of that point (marching in the street), and a simple need to be told <em>everything is going to be okay</em> by a symbol of supreme leadership so you can get back to mowing your lawn (watching the convention).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day two was reflective out of necessity. We needed to scan the news outlets, interpret perspectives, and reflect on perceptions after the whirlwind 24 hours that preceded it. I start thinking about deliverance when thinking about Biden. Last night, with the bar’s television on mute, it looked like the fire in his eyes and fury in his face as he railed on in his speech seemed to scream out “<em>Don’t forget me!</em>” This morning, I read a piece in the Guardian, in which David Smith remarks the speech was “the culmination of a night that for Biden must have felt either like receiving an honorary Oscar or giving the oration at his own funeral”—likely a combination of both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For as long as I, too, was a part of the millions who felt his age was a deciding (and excluding) factor, I still felt a hint of tragedy about his departure, about how, as Smith notes, “all of it shows the mercilessness of politics”—and entertainment in general—“and the mercilessness of time. How quickly the golden boy becomes yesterday’s man.” Even though Biden is a career politician, and many have gathered in the streets to convince us he’s a heartless agent of genocide, there is something to seeing an elderly person on stage have to manage the emotional weight of calculating everything they did that brought them to that point, and, with only the end left to look forward to, to comprehend one final, summative betrayal.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>A quick recap of the day’s events</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We play catch-up for most of the day—and can’t catch up to the protestors at the Israeli embassy because we’ve learned it isn’t easy to track their movements, committed to communicating with each other via encrypted messenger apps as they are. We take a bus out to the Pulaski Park neighborhood in West Town, centered around a park designed by landscape architect Jens Jensen (who also delivered the nation’s first native plant garden to Union Park) and named for the Polish hero of the American Revolutionary War, Kazimierz Pułaski.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We eat at a cheap Polish dining hall called Podhalanka that reminded me of the Warsaw of the early ‘90s, when my dad took me to cafeterias in the city to experience the no-frills, egalitarian feel to “dining out” when the country was still the PRL (People’s Republic of Poland). The neighborhood was once a largely Polish enclave—Division Street was once known as the “Polish Broadway”—but Podhalanka is the only Polish business left. And on Friday, after 40 years, it shutters for good. We eat cabbage soup to rejuvenate our souls and share a batch of pierogies with a couple of Polish kielbasas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We spend some time writing at the West Town Public Library, which sits on the ground floor of the grand Goldblatt’s Building, built in the late-Chicago School commercial style in 1915 to house the once famed department store founded by a pair of Polish-Jewish brothers, Maurice and Nathan Goldblatt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We head to Chipp Inn, a cash-only corner dive on Greenview Avenue that dates back to 1897 for $3 beers and an opportunity to go over notes and check the news.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""id"":3407,""sizeSlug"":""large"",""linkDestination"":""none""} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>At 9:26 pm</strong>, we are at The Corner Bar in Bucktown, where we watch Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff step up to speak. The woman next to me, who’s probably in her late 30s, early 40s, says she was at the convention yesterday, thanks to a friend who works for a senator. Soon enough, the time everyone at the convention (not at the bar, hardly anyone at the bar is watching but O’Brien, this woman, and me) is waiting for arrives: the Obamas. It’s safe to say everyone has vivid, emotional ties to the Obamas (even if it’s simply linked to where they were in their lives when the American president was an eloquent young-ish man who represented hope and change). Yet, today, sixteen years later, I find myself slipping, like someone sitting on an ill-fitting stool, in and out of cynicism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The circumstances of the 1968 Democratic National Convention were far more complex than this one (than any convention in recent history) and one reason is precisely because it put on public display the theater of mean-spirited, Machiavellianism characteristic of American electioneering that creates “an environment in which men cannot function in any kind of decent and humane” way. Today—and all throughout this convention—the speeches are characterized by simple, saccharine stories, using a kind of <em>tell yourself it’ll all be okay and you’ll believe it </em>language typically reserved for addressing children and personal crises. They are more often than not riddled with “cliches that men always use when they wish to conceal, rather than convey, thought.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With President Obama in particular, calling Trump “the neighbor who keeps running his leaf blower outside your window every minute of every day,” is a wonderfully evocative image. But then you think, this guy makes hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars to say just this kind of stuff. Then the brilliant stroke of the hand gesture juxtaposed with his facial expression while he made fun of&nbsp; Trump’s “weird obsession with crowd sizes” which cracks you up. And then you think of the banks and drones, oh lord, the drones, so many drones—increasingly a key aspect of his legacy.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, since Biden was effectively forced to step aside, <em>everyone</em> has been applauding his incredible courage and commitment to the American people by “putting his country before his ambition.” But it’s so clearly a large swath of influential people gaslighting themselves to gaslight the world into believing a completely different narrative. Yes, “we do not need four more years of bluster and bumbling and chaos.” But when was the last time we weren’t submerged in a quintessentially American dose of bluster and chaos?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>George Reedy ends his foreword to <em>The Twilight of the American Presidency</em> with a clarion call: “...one of the few historical principles in which I still retain faith is that an inadequate government will either fall or resort to repression. There is no reason to believe that the United States is exempt from the forces of history.” I get up to hit the head while most of us at the bar sing along to the Rolling Stones’ “Out of Time.” On the wall above the urinal I read in all-caps black Sharpie: “As barbarians topple barbarians, lost in the midst of ever-shifting good and evil, our only constant is feeling <em>less human</em>.”</p>

At least he can perform ten jumping jacks and run in circles around the pro-Palestinian protestors. At least he can dance. One day, with enough practice and a bit of pizazz, he might even learn to talk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am going to be optimistic. I am going to keep my faith in the First Amendment. I am going to keep standing outside the United Center, where thousands of Harris supporters are lining up to attend day three of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and I’m going to tell myself that the people protesting around them must be protected at all costs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like the ghoul. While it is not necessarily clear what he is protesting, his presence is charming, even affable. I don’t need to dwell on the particulars of his message. By his very nature, dressed in a skin-tight onesie that covers his body and his face with the graphic print of a gray human corpse, it is possible that he has simply come to the United Center to protest an historically troubling injustice: Death. He has brought a friend. Look, the ghoul is having a conversation with a woman dressed as an anime character. She has purple hair and is flying the flag of Hezbollah. Now she is flying the red flag of communism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To join the fast-moving line into the DNC, a Harris supporter must pass the ghoul and the anime character, but they can ignore them by looking the other way. Ignoring the pro-Palestinian protestors takes more ambition. Standing next to the line, just before the first security checkpoint, the protestors have brought megaphones, and they’re using them with the same energy and composure that the Christians, just over there, are using theirs. “There’s blood on your hands,” a pro-Palestinian protestor says to the people in line. He’s wearing a red <em>Landback</em> flag like a cape. He continues: “Children are being murdered with weapons paid for by your tax dollars.” Harris's supporters are blessed with hands, and they use them to cover their ears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The message from the Christians is more subdued. “Attention, Democrats,” says a middle-aged man in a yellow fluorescent hoodie and long white socks. “God is getting ready to unleash his wrath on this nation, and we are not ready for it.” He says a lot more, but it turns out I can’t hear him. For a violinist has arrived, and so have a couple of ex-con Trump supporters, and now there’s a content creator yelling “We here at the DNC in Chicago baby let’s get it!” in front of a camera. He yells it about ten times before he’s happy. Luckily, the Christians have placards, so I don’t have to hear what they’re saying to receive their message. From left to right, I read: “The wrath of God abides upon the children of disobedience”; “Abortion is murder”; “Homo Sex Is Sin”; and “Trust Jesus.”</p>

<p class=""indented"">A man with a camera and a “Make America Great Again” hat has arrived. Without delay, he walks to the line of seated women campaigning for congressional candidate Tamie Wilson, all of whom are holding their own placards with worrying messages like, “A woman’s place is in the house, the senate, and the oval office.” The MAGA man wastes no time introducing himself: “Are you offended by this hat?” he says, pointing to his nice red hat, and holding his camera so it gets his face and the face of the woman he’s talking to in frame. Before he can hear the woman’s response, the MAGA man is distracted: The ghoul, full of life, is doing the worm on the asphalt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the ghoul is doing the worm on the asphalt, I talk to a guy who works for a “small news company.” I’ve been watching him film the arrival of congressmen and congresswomen and other special guests who get to cut the main line into the convention. Judging by the way he runs up to them and asks them about such things as genocide and weapons embargoes, he’s not applying for a job. During a dry stretch of VIP arrivals, when the only things to look at are the ghoul and the anime character sucking an imaginary penis in front of the Christians, I ask the guy what he thinks about everything happening in front of us. “Hezbollah is responsible for the death of US servicemen,” he tells me, and I find it absolutely impossible to determine what side he’s on, if he’s on a side at all.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m relieved when a man asks me if I want to buy three Harris-Walz 2024 pin-back buttons for $10.00. “Everyone needs a button,” he says in such a friendly and despairing tone that I almost reach for my wallet. But I have been standing here too long. I have been waiting for something to happen. Two blocks away, in Union Park, hundreds of protestors under the banner of the Coalition for Justice in Palestine have been rallying and preparing to march on the DNC once again. Sosnowski and I wondered if I'd find them here, breaching the fences of the United Center and resisting the thousands of police officers cordoning the streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I walk away in search of Sosnowski, who left a little while ago to charge his phone, the ghoul is doing push ups in front of the Christians, the man with the MAGA hat is smoking two THC pens at once in front of the content creator’s camera, and the small party of pro-Palestinian protestors is reading the names of children killed in Gaza. Meanwhile, Harris’s supporters continue to arrive, streaming into the United Center for another night of fanfare, past the police, past the cameras, and past the nine or ten Ukrainians on the corner, all of them silent, all of them holding signs that say, “Victory for Ukraine, Victory for Democracy.”</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>A line of police vans</strong> <strong>along Ogden Avenue</strong>. Cruisers spread out, lights blazing, blocking intersections. But what’s really striking is the police cordon, two rows deep, from Ashland Avenue at Maypole to Washington as it curves along the park and spills into Ogden. It is 7:53 pm, the sky is pale blue with the last dashes of sunlight receding to the west. O’Brien and I slow down and finally halt, curious and expectant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first bulwark we catch while walking north on Ashland is made up of the bicycle brigade. Suddenly, they mount in that particular way of theirs and ride off one-by-one, an ever-lengthening black and blue snake, onto Washington Avenue. North of Washington along Ashland a line of foot soldiers in their blue shirts and high-visibility vests stand at the edge of the sidewalk, another row of bicycles just behind them parked along the curb. In the park, the Palestinian flags continue to wave and dance and the chants are now, after a solid five and half hours, more of a low steady hum, hardly louder than the general buzz of the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not a massive gathering, but it’s not exactly small either. Maybe a hundred, a couple hundred tops. We stop on the sidewalk opposite Maypole street to talk to a couple of photographers just when the line of foot cops are called to attention and told to move out, south down Ashland, and east onto Washington. One of the photographers is flying solo, without a badge, while the other has his official press credentials as a representative of <em>The Chicago Crusader</em>, a local African-American weekly since 1940. All around us the clicking sound of bikes in motion.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We shoot the shit about where we’re from—the freelancer originally from Modesto, the Crusader a Chicagoan—and the Crusader warns us to have our wits about us if we’re not wearing press passes when things get heated. “The police’ll push you in with the others when it’s time to disperse. Bunch of journalists got locked up last night.” The march started around 5:00 p.m. and headed down to the United Center again, a couple blocks to the southwest, before returning to the park to continue rallying. I ask if there’s a curfew, and they say no, no curfew, so I ask about the double stacked bulwark. “It’s to pack everyone into the park,” the freelancer from Modesto says. Like herding. I ask if anything’s been heated, and they say not really, no violence or pressure from either side. (When we first approached, the freelancer looked like he was catching up with a buddy, a police officer.)&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually we part company and continue up Ashland to the L station, where we’ll catch a Pink line train into the Loop. Just before the stairs stands a grip of police officers who seem to be resting, joking, laughing. Someone at the bus stop is filming with their phone, yelling vitriol at a man in a chainmail, medieval battle costume, more or less in Palestinian colors. The cops shake their heads and laugh and another photographer on his bicycle says, “I’ve had enough weirdos for today.”</p>

<p class=""unindented"" id=""unindented""><strong>We first arrive at Union Park</strong> <strong>at 2:39 pm</strong>, after a hearty lunch at Al’s # 1 Beef in Little Italy and a train ride to the park where we overheard some college-aged people from SDS (Students for a Democratic Society, UIC and Milwaukee chapters) in protest dress (keffiyeh, mask, combat boots…) talk about recent events (“...he came away with bruised ribs…”). Everyone is amassing in the baseball dirt that’s surrounded by the bleachers where there’s a large banner and a podium.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>O’Brien moves closer to the center of the flag-waving. It’s mostly Palestinians, who chat in Arabic. The men here are all well-built, and in their CJP (Coalition for Justice in Palestine) high-visibility vests and keffiyehs they look like soldiers. The air is anticipatory and somewhat tense around certain members of the press. One man with a gigantic flag walks around chanting “Free Palestine!”, occasionally speaking in Arabic with the CJP guys. I break from the scene and talk with some people at the RCA (Revolutionary Communists of America) table standing at the corner of Washington and Ashland. At:</p>

<p class=""unindented"" id=""unindented""><strong>3:16 pm</strong>, I’m sitting at the bleachers watching the crowd grow as people continue to file into the park from all directions, and different rhymed chants go out over the P.A. The police are all along the perimeter. I learn from a local that this is an unpermitted gathering, unaffiliated with Monday’s coalition, but one that is Palestinian-oriented—Chicago has one of the largest Palestinian populations in the country—with mosques helping bus in participants from the suburbs.</p>

<p id=""unindented""><strong>3:21pm, </strong>a troll with a large American flag breaks in and marches about the park in strange circuits, in and out of the group yelling “I wanna see <em>this</em> flag! How about the flag of our country?!?” Some pro-Palestinian protesters start following him with their flag. He makes it into the thick of things, just beside the podium and stops. He is surrounded. “How about flying the flag of my country?!?” he shouts. “This is my country and I want to see my flag!” “Fuck you and fuck your flag!” someone yells out.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Please! Listen to your marshalls!” the P.A. roars, then conceivably the same in Arabic. “Do not follow the agitators! Please! Listen to us! Do not follow the agitators—that’s what they want you to do!” More Arabic. He’s outnumbered and outgunned but he’s damn defiant. He’s a Black man in a black suit with black sunglasses being followed by a few young white guys who have their phones out to record. Every so often another batch of pro-Palestinian protesters are goaded into following him, flags waving, and the whole things starts again. For someone who hates flags, I’ve never hated flags more than this.&nbsp;</p>

<p id=""unindented""><strong>3:40 pm</strong> I’m at the east end of the park, by the basketball courts. There’s a couple of pickup games and some kids shooting layups.

Hundreds at this point. The reporter holds his microphone and practices his baseball swing. A few times. Good form.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>We move through the crowd again and spot a man a couple dozen yards away shuffling along with a cardboard sign that reads “Help the Homeless.” For the two or three minutes I track him I don’t see anyone acknowledge him or his cup.&nbsp;</p>

<p id=""unindented""><strong>4:45 pm</strong>. At the corner of Madison and Paulina everything is effectively cordoned off by police. Cars come and go to drop off DNC attendees. Badge and ticket holders—well-dressed in suits and dresses—file into a gated entryway on the north side of Madison. Police and security by the barricades handle all movement. A gathering of three or four pro-Palestinian protesters have set up a bullhorn directly next to the gates where DNC-goers wait in a slow-moving line. They have a bed sheet that says “Blood on your hands.” One of them lists out the name and age of a dead child, then the two standing either side holding the sheet chant “There is blood on your hands!” This will go on. Every now and then another one of them, with his own bullhorn and a “Landback” flag, will call out a few people in particular, or make conversation like, “You can be Black or brown and still support genocide! I know, it’s wild right?”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the southwest corner of the intersection, someone plays a tenor horn along to a boombox playing popular hits by Stevie Wonder, Gotye, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The DNC attendees are a diverse crowd, mostly Millennial and Gen-X-aged. Many of them are very good-looking and put together in a way that betrays their income bracket. The men all have serious faces, like they have a lot of investments; &nbsp;the women like they have a lot of important contacts. It’s almost a texture—or lack thereof—the rich seem to have, the smells, the anti-aging products, the sheen on their clothes. Out of black SUVs emerge sleek beings who exude a put-togetherness that would be almost beguiling were it not so haughty and inhuman.&nbsp;</p>

The driver and his partner stand by each taillight, hands clasped behind their backs. An OEMC officer yells at them: “<em>Move your car</em>! You can’t<em> </em>park here!” They say something to her and she makes a disapproving face. She goes to talk to a cop. The cop approaches the two men and again a close conversation takes place. His expression is one of reluctant acknowledgement. Another five minutes passes. I’m standing right by it. A woman and two children approach the Escalade and the door opens. It’s Rosario Dawson, accompanied by a bored-looking man who is not Corey Booker. She puts on a facemask and they are ushered into the central, “VIP” entrance, through barricades that are manned by two guards and three police officers, one in full combat gear.&nbsp;</p>

The man with the bullhorn hops away from the three listing out the children and tries to get in Warnock’s way. There is a swift response from all forces. “Yo bro! You can end the genocide today! Come on, bro!” He is stopped at the barricades and he continues to call out to Warnock while security glower and tell him “<em>get</em> <em>back</em> in front of the gates”; how swiftly I spot hands grabbing ahold of the wooden batons.</p>

They set up a large P.A. system and get to work. I also notice there is a person with rainbow-colored piñata-textured tights who has been playing very strange, weepy music on an amplified violin.

Views are exchanged, diatribes traded, platforms debated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The leader of the ExCons says “Now I don’t give a flying <em>fuck</em> about either party. My interest is <em>the fall of America, period</em>. Do you hear that? The fall of America, period, and Trump represents the best opportunity to bring about the end of this system that has been oppressing us <em>for</em> <em>centuries</em>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Texan responds by asking what he thinks about the impoverished, the undereducated, those who have no access to healthcare, the trans brothers and sisters, the disenfranchised youth for whom the Republican party’s entire platform is a threat, for whom Donald Trump would be a tragedy. They ask where he gets his news from.</p>

I learn this from the bartender who is one of those wonders that brings everyone seated at a bar into one loose conversation. The DNC is on and it’s odd to know we watched most of those people walk into the building. </p>

<p>O’Brien is worn out too, I can see it all over his face. “The thing about these things,” he says, “is they’re always building up, and just when it feels like something’s about to happen, it diffuses.” But there is a relentless onslaught of stimulation. And it must be the bonds of partisanship, or ideological loyalty, or intense identification that keep these things afloat on a psychic, or otherwise purely adrenaline-infused level. It is a marathon that, were it not so tragic, or so comic, or so absurd from every angle, would be a feat of human strength riveting to watch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much later, under the cloak of another brilliant night, the sounds of sirens will continually break up the buzz and hum of the incandescent city streets near the Loop while tourists and couples and Chicagoans will gently stroll the lakeside. We take in Grant Park and try to picture the masses we witnessed multiplied by over 10, all over it, between its trees and benches and lanes, with a pressure and mutual fury so intense that pressed bodies would burst through plate glass windows. An American tragedy. Meanwhile, at the DNC, Coach Walz will tell a packed stadium, “We’re down a field goal, but we’re on offense, and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And, boy, do we have the right team.”</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>On stage at the DNC</strong>, Eva Longoria is talking about energy. “The energy tonight isn’t just here in Chicago,” she says to the thousands of Harris supporters gathered inside the United Center. “It’s all across the country.” Suddenly, the blue screen behind her fills with eleven live streams from states like Wisconsin, Georgia, and Philadelphia where Harris supporters are hosting their own viewing parties of the DNC. “Say hello,” Longoria says to the DNC audience in front of her, and what happens is this: the audience in front of her wave their flags and Kamala banners at the audiences across the nation, and the audiences across the nation wave back. All of Harris’s America, it seems, is waving at itself through the bright blue screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would make this moment even brighter is a nice chant, something fresh that everyone can say together, and Longoria gives one a go: “She se puede!” she yells, riffing on the Spanish “<em>sí se puede</em>” (“Yes, we can”). Everyone does their best, but the words fall flat. Luckily, there’s a Republican in the room. Adam Kinzinger, a former Illinois Republican representative, is bemused when he takes the podium: “I never thought I’d be here,” he confides. “But listen,” he says, smiling at the crowd, “you never thought you’d see me here, did you?” Everyone finds this very <em>funny</em>. Everyone laughs, in that kind of relieved way that people laugh when they survive a near-death experience. And when Kinzinger says, very seriously, “I’ve learned something about the Democratic Party, and I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret: the Democrats are as patriotic as us. They <em>love</em> this country just as much as we do,” the crowd finds its voice: “USA!” they chant. “USA!” “USA!” The <em>USAs</em> are loud, but you can just hear Kinzinger’s nervous little laugh, as if he’s remembering the people in front of him are not, in fact, Republicans.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Earlier in the day, I’d had a nervous little laugh of my own. Unconvinced that we needed to hear another “Free, Free Palestine” in the streets, Sosnowski and I decided to visit the Art Institute of Chicago. After a communal experience of 20th Century American art, we split up, and I found myself upstairs walking through the rooms of Medieval and Renaissance art. After looking at a couple of Virgin Marys, I stopped in front of Giovanni di Paolo’s paintings of St. John the Baptist, who famously said Christ was just around the corner. There, in one painting, I saw Salome kneeling in front of her dad, Herod, asking him if he wouldn’t mind chopping off St. John’s head. The way di Paolo had painted Herod, he looked a little dopy, and upset, as if he had a rock in his eye and he was trying to wink it out. It was the painting next to it, titled, <em>The Head of Saint John the Baptist Brought before Herod</em>, that made me laugh, not at the sight of John’s head on a golden plate, which looked presentable, but at the way di Paolo had painted the king: he had both hands in the air, he was recoiling, and he looked miffed, even anguished, as if he didn’t know why there was a head in front of him.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“And they,” Kinzinger continues on stage at the DNC, “are as eager to defend American values at home and abroad as we conservatives have ever been.” What he means, and what he makes clear over the next seven or eight minutes, is that Harris is a conservative. “Some have questioned the stance I’ve taken,” he says. But the answer, he says, is simple: “I know Kamala Harris shares my allegiance to the rule of law, the constitution, and democracy, and she is dedicated to upholding all three in service to our country. Whatever policies we disagree on pale in comparison with those fundamental matters of principle, of decency, and of fidelity to this nation.” Then: “Listen, to my fellow Republicans, if you still pledge allegiance to those principles, I suspect you belong here, too. Because democracy knows no party. It’s a living, breathing ideal that defines us as a nation. It’s the bedrock that separates us from tyranny. And when that foundation is fractured, we must all stand together, united, to strengthen it.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the United Center stands. In a few minutes, when Kamala Harris takes the stage, they’ll stand again. Everyone would probably keep standing, but it’s only polite to take a seat when the Vice President is speaking, and that’s what they do as she talks about “advancing our security and values abroad” and ensuring “America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world,” all of which certify conservatism’s new color: blue.</p>

<p><strong>The last day of the convention</strong>. The coronation ceremony is all that remains, the moment Vice President Harris will say, “on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America.” Reflect on the feeling one gets in the knowledge that the matrix of global finance is disinterested in everything but profit and proliferation, programmatically monomaniacal like a virus. There is one last cumulative march on the DNC for Palestine, but neither O’Brien nor I feel up for it. The continued juxtaposition of the world outside the United Center with the one inside does a number.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we start off into the city this final time, our mood is quieter, more pensive, the cicadas are playing their song on cue on another warm, remarkably clear day. I compare myself to a glass of fizzy water left on the dining room table of an empty house. The Art Institute of Chicago is the only tonic. We decide to walk there from the River North neighborhood after lunch at Schneider Deli.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is a busy Thursday, with people shopping, working, traversing to and fro, and tourists filling the streets to the sounds of cars and trucks and horns and the smells of restaurant kitchens and alleyways and exhaust fumes and hot pavement. The architecture of Chicago is so renowned it has its own style—two even (the Chicago School and the Second Chicago School). O’Brien points out the “Corn Cobs” of Marina City. I notice a remarkable Moorish Revival auditorium that once could have been a house of religious worship but is, fittingly, a Bally’s casino. San Francisco is colorful but really it’s the white, gleaming city on the hill; Los Angeles is the tan of the Mojave basin and the Warner Bros. lot laced in smog’s foul pewter; Manhattan is the gray of its proprietary stone; Brooklyn is ruddy-brown; and New Orleans is the loamy, earthen hue of bayous and cypress. But Chicago, when you mix up its red brick, limestone, charcoal steel, and rust, Chicago is hard slate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We turn onto Michigan Avenue and trek southward along the Magnificent Mile, an opulent thoroughfare linking the Loop to the Gold Coast of the Near North Side. O’Brien wants to show me the Chicago Tribune tower in particular, but it is easy to get distracted. He describes the Tribune tower’s defining feature—an assortment of tiny chunks of building materials from the wonders of the world and other historically significant edifices that are incorporated into the lowest levels of the 463-foot, 36-story, neo-Gothic hulk. I spot an elaborate mix of architectural styles across from me, with three priests—or soldiers?—in a gothic or Assyrian style at about middle height; a little bit lower a frieze depicts a tall, Osiris-like ruler overlooking a busy scene of horses and tigers and soldiers and chariots. “That?” I ask. “No, that's Michael Jordan’s steakhouse,” O’Brien responds, referring to the steakhouse in the lobby of what is, in fact, the InterContinental Hotel, originally built as the Medinah Athletic Club in 1929. But I can see now, just across the street, a glorious and imposing neo-Gothic tower of limestone and glass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up close, the Tribune Tower looks like a climber’s paradise, a chunk from the Dome of St. Peter’s in Rome protrudes here, a stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza for your foot there; a small chunk to place your hand from Angkor Wat; a grotesque from the houses of Parliament; and here, a different texture, a block from the Old General Post Office in Dublin. There is a brick from Wrigley Field that, with a swish of yellow, looks like a hot dog, and above it a Fleur-de-lis from Notre Dame. We stand in Pioneer Court and admire the Chicago Tribune sign for a few minutes while the swirl of people go by, taking selfies and videos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just before the DuSable Bridge, I hear a gentle kind of music drifting in—something electronic and sanguine that sounds like vibraphones and other synthetic sounds—that I assume is meant to be soothing but is kind of unnerving, as though someone from Burning Man were dragging windchimes along your body. We turn and see an RV for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,’s campaign parked in the little driveway to Pioneer Court, “@Kennedy24BusAcrossAmerica” emblazoned across the side, “The Remedy is Kennedy” on the doors. It slowly inches forward and the hippie behind the wheel waves at all of us. Serendipitously, the sleek, gunmetal blue, all glass 100-story Trump tower, with his name slapped across the front, like all his towers, in massive chrome, looms behind. Couldn’t you <em>almost</em> picture it, in mad, fever dream America: a Trump / Kennedy ticket?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We cross the Chicago River and come to the corner of East Wacker Place. Designed by the Burnham Brothers (sons of renowned Chicago urban planner Daniel H. Burnham) and built in 1929 to house a major chemical company, the flat black granite base, the dark green and gold terracotta bricks, and the gilt accents of the intoxicating Carbide &amp; Carbon Building is to me the most remarkable example of the Art Deco style, the glittering realization of the dream. The Chrysler Building is a marvel, yes, but this is something else entirely. Los Angeles’s Richfield Oil tower was magnificent (although it was much shorter and has long since been demolished), as is Manhattan’s American Radiator Building, both clad in all-black. But the Carbide &amp; Carbon, shimmering here in juniper green like snakeskin from the sunlight reflecting off the glass surface of the citizenM hotel tower across the street, is the apotheosis of the American Art Deco skyscraper, so much beauty in the service of the sinister. These are immovable mirrors, intractable snapshots of states of mind throughout time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost to the Art Institute, we hear the familiar chants for a Free Palestine, then make out a row of police and the dancing, bloody hands of cardboard Netanyahu. The protesters, some two or three dozen strong, are compressed into the opening of an alleyway adjacent to the Chicago Cultural Center. Nobody really stops. A few cars honk. We walk to the Washington Street end of the neoclassical structure—full of intricate relief work and ornamentation in an Italian Renaissance style—and read it is closed for a DNC event. I try to simply look through the window and am told tersely it is closed, to step back. “We’re not political agitators,” I tell them affably, “mere architecture aficionados,” and I try to point the lobby mosaics out to my co-correspondent. “I’m just saying if you get too close they”—meaning the cops three yards away—“are going to get involved.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We go through a security checkpoint with metal detectors to enter Millenium Park and walk over to the Art Institute. There is no line.</p>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>American Art 1900-1950</strong>. <em>Nighthawks</em> did not travel to the Whitney for Hopper’s retrospective last year. The emptiness is even more stark up close, the details in the mundane objects more striking, the reflections in the windows across the road from the diner echoing the loneliness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are paintings by Peter Blume, Kay Sage, Norman Lewis, Arthur Dove, Archibald Motley, Georgia O’Keefe, Walter Ellison, Marsden Hartley; the recognizable forms of modernist painters are layered in mystery, ambiguity, vibrancy, and fantasy. I tour the halls piqued by vulnerability. I can’t place exactly why. The thousands of chants, thousands of bombs? The thousands-upon-thousands roar of applause? It’s a strange time for a first visit to Chicago, and strangely comforting to visit this museum, as if a sprawling complex filled with priceless, often ill-begotten art could somehow provide me with the unquestioning embrace my nerves have asked for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From 1900-1950, I go further back. To the reassuring, clean lines of a Shaker sewing desk. To the ghostly portraits of my beloved Whistler, compact and gleaming. From there I pass through the arts of the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine worlds—those remarkable transmissions across the ages using only form for language—to the Chagall Windows. When Chagall worked on the <em>America Windows</em> for the United States bicentennial in 1976, Israel was still in the wake of the Yom Kippur War; the movement to settle the West Bank, through Gush Emunim, still nascent. On March, 30, 1976, local Arab leaders imposed a general strike to protest the land grabs, henceforth commemorated as Land Day. In 1977, when the windows were gifted to the Art Institute of Chicago, Israel’s center-left Labor Party lost for the first time in its history to the populist, arch-conservative Menachem Begin and his Likud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chagall’s hypnotizing stained glass panels tell the story of America through music, painting, literature, architecture, theater, and dance. At the bottom of one of the last panels, a menorah gleams under a figure seemingly in oration. I think of the Yiddish theater, and of my Polish-Lithuanian great-grandmother’s humor, her tragi-comic, earthy expressions, like “Man plans, God laughs” (<em>Człowiek się męczy, a Bóg się śmieje</em>)<em>. </em>I feel bathed by Chagall’s blue and somehow delivered. “To me, stained glass is the transparent wall between my heart and the world’s,” remarked Chagall. “It must come alive through the light it receives.”</p>

<p><strong>So how to close off this dispatch</strong>—this string of dispatches? It is much easier to deal with inanimate objects than with the murky, used bathwater of human motive, human behavior. We stop by the Hilton for a drink and a snack. Our server asks us if we’re going to the DNC watch party at Soldier Field. Without actual plans for the Harris acceptance speech, why not? At dinner in River North, in the shadow of the Merchandise Mart—once the largest building in the world—we learn Soldier Field is beyond capacity. </p>

<p>Back at the hostel, I fill a tupperware container with ice, grab a Coca-Cola from the vending machine, and crack open a pint of Jim Beam. We listen to the speeches, we watch the sea of rapturous faces, waving American flags, note the vertical “Kamala” signs dancing wildly, like all the signs during these four long days, and admire the neatly compiled “key points” compiled for every speaker, like “Son of Latino immigrants” and “Growing up, dreamed of becoming an ESPN anchor.” Hunter Thompson’s famous words from <em>Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas </em>spring to mind: “<em>There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning</em>,” and I try to imagine what that must have felt like. <em>Si monumentum requiris, circumspice </em>(“If a monument you seek, look all around”)<em>.</em></p>

3486,"Orson Welles Meets a Deadline","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph""><em>Editor’s Note: The following is an excerpt from Steve Wasserman’s memoir, </em>Tell Me Something, Tell Me Anything, Even If It’s a Lie,<em> out October 2024, Heyday.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>In <em>My Lunches with Orson Welles</em></strong>, my old friend Peter Biskind, Hollywood historian extraordinaire, has rescued from Henry Jaglom’s jumbled closet the hours upon hours of table-talk Jaglom recorded during his years of acting as amanuensis to the great man. As I hoovered up these edited transcripts of the higher gossip, I thought fondly of my own encounter with Welles—an encounter that would lead to irregular meals (and something of a friendship) at his favored table at Ma Maison.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The story begins with the death of Jean Renoir in Beverly Hills in early 1979. I was then deputy editor of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Sunday opinion section. The <em>Times</em>, in its infinite wisdom, had consigned news of Renoir’s demise to an AP wire story buried on page nineteen of the Sunday paper. I was beside myself with unhappiness. Here was one of the great directors of the twentieth century, dying in our backyard, as it were, banished to an ignominious squib on the paper’s inside pages instead of being ballyhooed prominently on the front page.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The honor of the paper was at stake, I felt. We needed to act immediately to commission a proper piece, honoring Renoir’s life and legacy, to publish in the next Sunday’s paper. Only Orson Welles, I felt, could do right by Renoir. But how to contact him? I knew only that Welles made a habit of eating lunch every Wednesday at Ma Maison, but I would need his piece, should he agree to write it, by Wednesday, or Thursday at latest, in order to make the Sunday paper. I remembered that some years before, Welles had been the voice of the Paul Masson Winery, intoning, “no wine before its time.” I called the winery and was referred to an ad agency in New York and was, in turn, given the name of Welles’s Manhattan agent. I rang and explained my purpose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“So, you want to reach Orson Welles, do you? Well, a lot of people want to reach him. Listen, kid, here’s what I’ll do. I’m gonna give you his office number. It’s a local number. Area code two-one-three. You’re unlikely to reach him, but if you do, will you do me a favor? Will you tell him to call his agent, for cryin’ out loud?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I dialed the number. It rang and rang and rang. Finally, the receiver was slowly lifted off its cradle, and what can only be described as an extraordinarily fey voice drawled hello. It was Welles’s assistant. I asked to speak to Welles. “I’m sorry, but Mr. Welles isn’t in.” “Do you expect him back soon?” “I do not know when he’ll be back. You see, Mr. Welles almost never comes in.” “Might I leave a message?” “Yes, if you must,” the voice said in tones of great exasperation. “But do understand that when Mr. Welles deigns to come into this office, he very often sees the stack of messages piled high on the desk and he sweeps them to the floor.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next morning, I got to work early. Already at my desk was my boss, Anthony Day, editor of the paper’s editorial pages. He was clutching my phone. “Yes, yes. I see him now, just coming in.” Cupping the receiver, he looked at me and stammered, “Steve, it’s . . . it’s Orson Welles. For you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>“So, you want to reach Orson Welles, do you? Well, a lot of people want to reach him. Listen, kid, here’s what I’ll do.

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I got on the horn and heard, in his inimitable voice, “Mr. Wasserman, this is Orson Welles. I did not know until I received your kind message that my great and good friend, Jean Renoir, had passed away. What, pray tell, would you have me do?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told him of the embarrassing and all but invisible notice that Renoir’s death had occasioned in the paper, and that we had an obligation to do what we could to remove the stain of shame. Would he write a piece?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“How long? How about two-hundred-fifty words?” he offered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given the length of Renoir’s life and his considerable achievement, I said a thousand might be better.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Let’s split the difference and agree to five hundred.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for deadline—he boomed, “I know, I know: you needed it yesterday.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For you, Mr. Welles, the day after tomorrow would be fine.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for compensation—he cut me off. “Let us not sully art with talk of money. I count on you to do the right thing. You will do that, won’t you?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I said I’d do my level best.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wednesday came and went. No piece. We were keeping space open on the front page of the opinion section. By noon on Thursday, we began to sweat. My phone rang. It was Gus, the paper’s receptionist-cum-security guard, who manned the front desk in the paper’s art deco lobby, worthy of the <em>Daily Planet</em>, at the center of which slowly revolved a globe boasting national boundaries not redrawn since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. A man saying he was from Mr. Welles’s office was waiting for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurried down. And there, greeting me, was an apparition straight out of <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>: a man, kitted out in livery, replete with leather driving gloves, handed me a manila envelope bearing Welles’s piece.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I walked slowly up the stairs to my second-floor office, I read what Welles had written. It wasn’t five hundred words; it was nine pages, two thousand words, typed double-spaced on an Underwood Five typewriter, and edited in Welles’s hand with a blue felt-tip pen, the last page of which bore his signature. Every sentence had oxygen in it. The lede was unforgettable: “For the high and mighty of the movies a Renoir on the wall is the equivalent of a Rolls Royce in the garage. Nothing like the same status was accorded the other Renoir who lived in Hollywood and who died here last week.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>The essay was perfect, all about the uneasy intersection of art and commerce, and, as I read it, I realized it was, of course, as much about Welles himself as it was about Renoir. It was about the trials and tribulations of neglected genius. It was, in a way, a kind of manifesto, a credo of artistic aspiration and principle.</p>

<p>The ending, too, was a doozy (the ellipses are Welles’s):</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">I have not spoken here of the man who I was proud to count as a friend. His friends were without number and we all loved him as Shakespeare was loved, “this side idolatry.” Let’s give him the last word: “To the question ‘Is the cinema an art?’ my answer is ‘What does it matter?’ . . . You can make films or you can cultivate a garden. Both have as much claim to being called an art as a poem by Verlaine or a painting by Delacroix. . . . Art is ‘making.’ The art of love is the art of making love. . . . My father never talked to me about art. He could not bear the word.”</p>

3498,"A Circular Experience","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>On a recent visit to the Hansell Gallery</strong> at the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz for the group exhibition “With the Moon Under Our Feet,” I was transported into a sultry, womb-like environment. The gallery contained a mélange of multimedia artworks, woven together like a patchwork of the unconscious. Curated by dama (aka, Amanda Maciel Antunes) in correspondence with their monthly <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/surrealist-study-group-ssg-hosted-by-dama-in-the-prs-library-tickets-727035271067"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Surrealist Study Group</a>, the show offered a portal into an interstitial realm filled with the murmurs of surreal and mystical feminine energy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img src=""https://dispatchesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Installation-View-3-scaled.jpeg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-3504""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I found the first of these murmurs in Penny Slinger’s <em>With the Moon Beneath My Feet</em>. Known for her mystical and often erotic expressions of feminine liberation, Slinger’s monochromatic photo collage shows a partially nude woman standing with the moon under her feet and a fiery sun behind her veiled head. She is larger than life, with clasped hands and head slightly bowed, in recognition of her body as a vessel of experience and of light. Surpassing mere materiality, she set the tone for the exhibition as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, I found two large, mixed-media sculptures by Regina Herod sitting on pedestals on opposite sides of the gallery. Made from deconstructed materials like a found chandelier and pigmented wax, the sculptures—titled <em>Warrior Rocks Through Eternity</em> and <em>They Want Everything and Nothing</em>—looked like otherworldly guardians surveying their feminine domain. The structural qualities of these arrangements seemed to symbolize, somewhat cryptically, the temperamental chemical makeup of society. Like an alchemist, Herod attempts to incorporate the more volatile, transmutative aspects of the material world into her creations. Seemingly sturdy objects made from steel have been bent and twisted in intricate rebellion, giving way to formations wholly unfounded.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Deposited horizontally at knee height to the right of the entrance, Jaklin Romine’s cross-shaped installation, <em>Orchid/Orquídea-Sunday best/Ropa Formal/Rosary, Mary, Faith, Love, Abuela, Rosario, Maria, Fé, Amor, Grandma</em>, looked like a winged coffin. Romine draped the sculpture in a silky, digitally sublimated fabric and an aluminum rosary in tribute to her late role model, her loving and resilient grandmother, a seamstress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the far sides of the room, two large tondos stood adjacent to one another, like twin moons that reflected each other’s light. <em>Unbridled Ambition</em>, a projected video performance installation by Maria Adela Diaz, and <em>Hidden Sister</em>, an elaborate photo and ink collage by Cindy Rehm, address the invisibility of women in contemporary culture by showing obscure perspectives of the female form interacting with nature. Then came <em>Womb Series</em>, a sprinkling of intricate graphite drawings by Sarah Reyes, as well as ethereal photo collages and mixed media-altered books by Lezley Saar.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together, the works in this show intentionally created what dama has called “a circular experience,” not only in how I negotiated the gallery space, but also in how my mind moved from examination to inquiry to insight and then back again. Unlike typical white-cube settings, many components of the gallery itself were incorporated into the overall experience, serving as an emotional conduit for the individual artworks on display. Strings on the gallery floor meandered like umbilical cords between stations. Artwork titles were inscribed like verses of poetry on the crepuscular gray walls. Slanted mirrors directly beneath the artworks created alternative vantage points and reflections. There was even a soundscape installation—a collaborative project between dama and Adele Bertei titled <em>Fantomette</em> (and inspired by the novel <em>Les Guérillères</em> by Monique Wittig)—that rested discreetly in one corner, emitting chanting sounds that evoked nature’s diurnal and nocturnal qualities.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“This show is a song of protest,” dama states in the show’s catalog. “A moment in time. It’s the space in-between.” Even the show’s title appears as a variation of a quote from The Book of Revelation:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">1. And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2. She was pregnant and crying out in pain and agony of giving birth. (Revelation 12:1)</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">This is the ancient goddess Isis, whose mythic wisdom makes her a symbol of the independent female strength permeating the artworks in “With the Moon Under Our Feet.” That this multi-generational mix included both artists recognized by museums and those lesser known, perfectly complemented the show’s underlying intention: to create an experience that transcends social status, convention, and even the constraints of gender and power. In a patriarchal world, female artists have long used the language of surrealism to express their stifled experiences. By accentuating these personal and often painful histories, the exhibit further legitimized the emotional landscape as a relevant form of social dialogue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Walking away from the PRS campus, I found myself acutely aware of that ludicrous battle still being fought by women artists today: the desire to be <em>truly</em> seen and heard. As elusive clouds dissolved across the approaching darkness, I pondered once more the unresolvable question of what our world would look like had female insight and creativity also been allowed to flourish throughout the centuries.</p>

Acetone<br>
New West Records, 2024<br>
$44.99 (Double LP)</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Acetone made exquisitely, magically ordinary music.</strong> The Los Angeles trio, who formed in 1992, adored artists that much of America had relegated to thrift-store bins: the easy-listening zither player Ruth Welcome, the trailblazing Hawaiian group Hui Ohana, the country crooner Charlie Rich. Sam Sweet wrote in <em>Hadley Lee Lightcap,</em> his self-published 2017 book on the band, “They came from the rock world, played like a jazz combo, and dressed like beach rats.” Many of their best recordings took place in a pool house and a spare bedroom, and they sound like they could have been made nowhere else. The group’s songs evoke slow breathing, gentle ocean waves, soft late-afternoon light, a California summer day running at quarter-speed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commercially, they left behind a legacy of disappointment. Signed to a cushy record deal around early 1993—a time when the music industry was flush with cash and seeking the next Nirvana—they were label-less and deep in debt by 1996. Their debut full-length, <em>Cindy</em> (1993), launched them on tours opening for The Verve and Oasis. But their second record, <em>If You Only Knew</em> (1996), flopped, ending up in the same dollar bins they drew their inspiration from. (A companion mini-album of covers, <em>I Guess I Would</em>, was released in 1995 and met the same fate.) They dug in, and kept refining their languid sound. Their third, eponymous album (1997) was a blissful masterpiece that fell into obscurity on arrival. <em>York Blvd.</em> (2000), their fourth LP and an ill-fitting bid for popularity, caused the band to splinter. In 2001 their singer, Richie Lee, took his own life. He was thirty-four.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But this telling of Acetone’s story is a disservice to their hypnotizing body of work. Their songs are too tranquil, too hospitable to make sense on commercial radio, in arenas, or giant festivals. They created music for living rooms. For ambiance they regularly brought thrift-shop lamps on stage with them. <em><a href=""https://www.roughtrade.com/en-us/product/acetone/ive-enjoyed-as-much-of-this-as-i-can-stand-live-at-the-knitting-factory-nyc-may-31-1998-rsd-2024-3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">I’ve Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand</a></em>, a newly uncovered live recording from their sole headlining tour in 1998, is available only on vinyl, a format intrinsically linked to listening in an intimate space.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><strong>I listened to the record one June afternoon</strong>, with my friend Michael in his turntable-equipped living room, spinning each side of the LP while we enjoyed a spread of fresh bagels and orange juice. Acetone has shifted our orientation to daily life, giving ease and looseness to the ways we walk, the ways we observe our surroundings, the ways we think as musicians and play our instruments. Their songs encourage slow breathing, easy but deliberate speech, a gently widened field of attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Opening the record with a slowed-down rendition of Link Wray’s proto-surf instrumental “Rumble,” Acetone take their time, letting their songs unfold, sinking into the hollows between beats. “Another Minute” is all graceful drift, the guitar sounds warping as if the music has begun to melt from sun exposure. “If You Only Knew,” though a little faster, bobs on the same steady tide. When it appeared on their second studio album, “I’ve Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand” sounded painfully dejected, the weary lament of someone trapped in hopelessness. In this live performance, they break their patient pacing and play the song at what feels like double-time, ripping through it as if in rejection of the misery they’d committed to tape a few years earlier. The trio were at their most assured in the late nineties, and this recording is full of confidence and love for the art of making music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acetone’s best recordings show how resonant, how instantaneous, how trusting their nonverbal communication is. Unlike so many jam bands, they seldom showed off. They had the intuitive flow of a jazz combo, but they played few traditional solos. They devised their own kind of virtuosity, their individual styles serving a hushed, absorbing conversation. Their dynamic is palpable in the home recordings they made near the end of their career, several of which appear on the extraordinary compilation <em>1992–2001 </em>(2018). About these recordings Mark Lightcap, their guitarist, told Sam Sweet, “We’d all be playing and doing so little. It was like keeping a snowflake in the air, or a bubble. You manage to keep it aloft and eventually it pops, but the time that it’s up there is so…” The quote ends with Lightcap’s longing pause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The band’s attention to delicate dynamics is plain, particularly during the first half of this record. Lee and Lightcap almost always sing at a near-whisper, but their harmonies on songs like “If You Only Knew” and “All You Know” float with perfect, lullaby-like calm. Their lyrics merge seamlessly with their spare and wistful playing. (“All you know has just slipped away / Still you go on waking up each day / How’d you get into this state?”)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Acetone also loved playing loud, and in the final stretch of the record they create swells of noise that rival Sonic Youth. Closing out the show with “Endless Summer,” one of their earliest and heaviest compositions, they end with drummer Steve Hadley doing an anti-solo, repeating a simple beat with swelling, oceanic force. When Hadley was first learning the drums, he was told to “listen to everyday sounds—cartoons, traffic, beach noise—and repeat them back as rhythms.” Hadley’s mastery of this style helped Acetone become kings of the depthless mundane.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sweet’s book <em><a href=""https://hadleyleelightcap.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hadley Lee Lightcap</a></em>—not only a great piece of music writing, but a great work of California nonfiction—emphasizes Acetone’s deep identification with Los Angeles at its most quietly poignant. When Sweet describes driving around LA with their music on the car stereo, he writes, “Their music made sense anywhere the late afternoon light caught a lonely wall.” Acetone is for liminal moments like these, pockets of introspection amid the frenzy of California Dreaming. In <em>I’ve Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand</em>—as in all of their best music—you can hear the low-level wonder within reach every day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like several other perpetually under-recognized artists from the nineties—Unwound, Karate, Bedhead, Duster—Acetone is now reaching new listeners. Their recordings are in print again, thanks to the dedication of longtime fans and the quirks of streaming culture. The <em>1992–2001</em> compilation released in 2018, followed by the reissue of all Acetone’s studio recordings in 2023, has even encouraged the group to start playing live again, with visual artist Senon Williams succeeding Richie Lee on bass.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This past April, I saw them take the stage in San Francisco. Even though Lee’s absence was palpable, Lightcap, Hadley, and Williams unfurled the same velvety tapestry as the one recorded in ’98. They started even slower this time, luxuriating in rhythms and tones that conjure the atmosphere of an empty California street in the summer, or a friend’s living room in the middle of the day. Twenty-six years after the recording of <em>I’ve Enjoyed as Much of This as I Can Stand</em>, they sound as rich and vital as they ever did. Easy to overlook, but a treasure to behold.</p>

3531,"A Theater of the Absurd Brought to Life","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Gavin Lambert struck an unusual tone</strong>—at once ironic and affirming—across <em>The Slide Area </em>(1959), his first novel and an unassuming masterpiece of Los Angeles fiction. Its narrator pairs a rare clarity of vision with an even rarer warmth of engagement: he manages to be sharp without being cutting, and sympathetic without being indulgent. If <em>The Slide Area</em> does not deliver the more familiar satisfactions of LA <em>noir </em>in its “scenes of Hollywood life” (as its subtitle has it), it is not because there are no crimes committed—there will be at least one murder, one case of statutory rape, and one case of fraud—but instead because Lambert’s interest lies elsewhere. As Gary Indiana has remarked of Lambert’s fiction more generally, it works to solve “mysteries of personality rather than crimes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The novel opens with its screenwriter-narrator “looking out of the window and wondering why the world seems bright yet melancholy.” The world outside his studio office is bright—bright with sunlight, bright with “neat flower-beds dustily brilliant in puce and yellow,” bright with the artifice of the constructed sets nearby, bright with the modern-day convertibles and other “princely roadsters” that make visible the wealth of Hollywood. Yet the scene is also suffused with melancholy—a melancholy that is less easily pinned down and grasped. The faces of executives burst into sweat at a nearby newspaper rack; the screenwriter sits in his office, his tray of finely-sharpened pencils going unused. The first “mystery of personality,” then, is the mystery of Hollywood’s ambience: Why is it that, for all the happy endings generated and filmed on site, an air of anxiety pulses beneath the smiles and laughter?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next two-hundred-plus pages, the narrator will be our guide into that enigma. He’ll criss-cross the neighborhoods of Santa Monica and Venice, the Hollywood hills and the Hollywood flats, often with the goal of helping a friend—or would-be friend—in need, acting as an accomplice to their far-flung desires. His ride will be a “fog-grey seventy dollar 1947 Chevrolet” with a “battered front I refuse to have mended.” He throws himself in with the damaged; in his world, they are the ones with character.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The controlling metaphor of the novel—Los Angeles as a “slide area” where the ground is always shifting under one’s feet—is handled with a light touch. “Sliding” can be fun as well as dangerous; the playground slide offers one of the most basic childhood pleasures, and Lambert is not so serious as to disown childhood delights. Eight years after <em>The Slide Area</em>, Joan Didion would use a more dismal, high-modernist metaphor—the slouch of Yeats’s rough beast “slouching toward Bethlehem”—to evoke the sense of American decline that she saw in the stirrings of the Californian counterculture. “Slouch” captured so well the nature of Didion’s distaste: she saw a failure of stance, a failure of moral posture, that correlated with a larger spinelessness, one made even more unseemly because its exponents dressed themselves up in the rhetoric of innocence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lambert is considerably less judgmental and infinitely less apocalyptic than Didion. <em>The Slide Area</em> crisply articulates the failings of Los Angeles (“Los Angeles is not a city, but a series of suburban approaches to a city that never materializes”) even as it finds a great variety of pleasure in their acquaintance. The “slide area” of the title refers, on a literal level, to a stretch of the Pacific Palisades, marked with signage that notes how it threatens to fall into the sea. When it does collapse in the novel’s opening section, however, the result is a parable of resilience, not declension. The scene looks grave at first—“the legs of old ladies” are seen “sticking out” from “a great pile of mud and stones and sandy earth.” But once rescued by emergency workers, these three elderly picnickers merely shake “little clods out of their hair” and declare themselves “quite all right” to the crowd. One says, “I was taken completely by surprise!” It’s a typically Lambertian moment, rich with a doubleness of feeling. The moment rings with a sense of irony—didn’t she notice those large SLIDE AREA signs when she chose the slope as the site of her picnic?—and a sense of amazement: the astonishment of having one’s life, a life of picnics and tablecloths and air cushions, turned willy-nilly into an adventure story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another quick signal of <em>The Slide Area</em>’s distance from <em>noir </em>comes in its early handling of a murder. The narrator locates himself in the southern end of Santa Monica, a neighborhood that is “rather slatternly and interesting.” In fact, Santa Monica may be interesting <em>because </em>it is slatternly—messy and dirty and populated by women who are open about selling their wares. In that life, there is real danger: The narrator discovers that a friend of his, a woman named Hank, has been murdered by a john. But the liveliness of that world—of a bar called The Place, where the narrator, Hank and her sister Zeena have been regulars—is unextinguished. The tone of the scene tilts, against the grain, toward the comic. The narrator is impressed into acting as a go-between between Zeena, who is drunk and wild with grief, and a straight-laced German nun, from the hospital where Hank has died, who cannot bear departures from sobriety. Meanwhile an old man in a Panama hat dances with his cane as the jukebox plays a song identified by the narrator as “Mackie Messer”—better known to us as “Mack the Knife,” and not incidentally a song about a killer. The show goes on.</p>

<p><em>The Slide Area</em> drew on Lambert’s gratitude to Los Angeles for having offered him a home—an escape-hatch from the repressive British milieu of his childhood and early adulthood. “In Britain,” he remembered, “it was bad form to be passionate. In American films, nobody drew back from caring. And, as a nine-year-old schoolboy, I sent a rather grubby postcard to Mae West, and she signed it and sent it back. I saw the American stamp, and Paramount's logo on its corner. So I knew Hollywood was real.” His larger awakening to the pleasures of Hollywood dovetailed with his sexual awakening, at the age of 11, while attending a prep school located on the grounds of Windsor Castle, where his music teacher became his lover. “Soon after falling in love with him,” Lambert recalled in his memoir, “I fell in love with the movies.” His lover-teacher often took him to the cinema on afternoons when there were no classes, introducing him to Warner Brothers noir as well as “the bright, voluptuous world of MGM.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eighteen months later, Lambert was taught a lesson about the perils of being gay in prewar Britain. His teacher-lover and two other queer teachers were fired by his school; around the same time, he discovered that his queer cousin, who had died some years previously, had in fact committed suicide. The young Lambert became convinced that he “had to live in a secret world.” Against the strictures of his childhood, he came to treasure “the illusion of movies, especially the world according to MGM, where the pursuit of happiness and the blessings of liberty were so confidently taken for granted.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the mid-1950s Lambert had carved out an iconoclastic role for himself in the world of British film. He revived the British Film Institute magazine <em>Sight and Sound </em>as its editor; he took up arms with the directors Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz, and Tony Richardson and founded the British Free Cinema movement, which promoted a new wave of documentary films, more personal and focused on the lives of the working-class; and he wrote and directed <em>Another Sky</em>, a lyrical film about a British woman’s passion for a Marrakech street musician, shot on location in Morocco with a small cast of British actors and Moroccan non-professionals. Lambert’s life took a fateful turn when he met Nicholas Ray, fresh off directing <em>Rebel Without a Cause </em>and distraught still over the death of its star, James Dean. The two spent the night together in Ray’s hotel bedroom; shortly afterward, Ray watched <em>Another Sky </em>and was moved to hire Lambert as his assistant, starting with his film <em>Bigger Than Life</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Through his work with Ray, Lambert came to understand Hollywood’s rhythms of work, and the sharp dealings between producers, directors, actors, agents, and publicists, all chasing the lure of success. (Later Lambert would become a successful screenwriter in his own right, nominated for Oscars for his work on <em>Sons and Lovers </em>and <em>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.</em>) He also became acquainted with LA from top to bottom, and felt connected to the rootlessness he perceived in the city: When, early in his stay in LA, he saw a house being towed down a street to its new destination, he took the image as a mirror of his own experience. After a little while, he felt himself stockpiling, in his mind, “faces, bodies, voices, lives: movie people, beach people, underside people living in trailers and decrepit clapboard bungalows, world-wise European exiles, naive refugees from Oklahoma and Louisiana, pickups in bars.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These characters would come to populate <em>The Slide Area</em>, but it was Ray’s disintegration that, through an ironic chain of circumstances, led Lambert to begin drafting the novel. Drinking and depressed, Ray was falling apart while working on his foreign-financed war film <em>Bitter Victory</em>—romantically involved with a heroin addict with a violent temper, and so drunk he did not realize how much money he was losing at night at the casinos. Ray’s French producer Paul Graetz was alarmed and made a ploy to control his errant director by clamping down on his assistant, whom he saw as loyal to Ray and not himself. He informed Lambert and Ray alike that Lambert would only be paid for his work on the film—money he desperately needed—if Ray returned from Tripoli having completed the location shooting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A pawn in this battle between producer and director, Lambert had six weeks to himself at the Hotel Raphaël, near the Champs-Elysées, where, on Graetz’s tab, he threw himself into the LA novel he had been carrying in his head. He had the intuition that, just as Christopher Isherwood<em> </em>had constructed his 1939 novel <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> from a fragmented set of interconnected episodes, so his novel would shift between characters and scenes, not resting with any one central protagonist or setting. He also repurposed a wry, highly visual, and economical style of narration: He took Isherwood’s “I am a camera” aesthetic and adapted it for the actual world where movies were made, as inflected by his own experience of Los Angeles as a city of refuge. <em>The Slide Area </em>was built out of scenes of unforced and somehow warm witness.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his book on the director George Cukor, Lambert wrote that, if the director’s life and work were to be summed up in one word, it would be “discreet,” which “implies delicacy, prudence, and something enigmatic. The ‘I’ exists but doesn’t care to advertise itself.” <em>The Slide Area </em>is held together by its discreet narrator, a keen observer who is also a recessive enigma. He is infinitely more private than the many characters he meets, who often take no more than a nudge to spill their secrets, ambitions, and theories of how the world works. Since we rarely gain insight into what the narrator specifically wants or desires, the action of the novel seems to fill that vacuum: what he most desires, it appears, is simply to know these other people, and through them to understand the city that supports or fails them. He feels as reliable as a first-person narrator can be. While quick to catch and register ironic details in the scenes he dramatizes, as a character he largely acts as a sounding-board for the wide cast of dreamers he meets, his sympathy allowing them to make the best case for their aspirations, or to give voice to their doubts and qualms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A brief summary of those aspirations suggests how easily they might have been mocked in the satirical manner of, say, Evelyn Waugh in his LA novel <em>The Loved One</em>. We meet a former British schoolmate, who desires only to sun himself on the beach and supports that lifestyle by living with a wealthy man he resents (“Nukuhiva!”); a blind and nearly deaf dowager-countess, still in love with the lost world of aristocratic Austro-Hungary and eager to go on one last Grand Tour, her declining senses and fortune be damned (“The End of the Line”); a middle-aged Hollywood star (based on Joan Crawford) seeking to revive her career through manipulation and force of will (“The Closed Set”); a fourteen-year-old midwestern runaway with a bottomless faith in her future stardom (“Dreaming Emma”); and a scion of a powerful Hollywood agent, erotically drawn to men and women, who drifts from one scrape to another (“Sometimes I’m Blue”). The novel’s main characters tend to be either creatures of ambition or creatures of pleasure, and in the loose structure of <em>The Slide Area</em> serve as foils of one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of Emma Slack, the runaway and would-be starlet, the narrator remarks:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">There was a kind of fanaticism about Emma, and perhaps this made her really helpless. In a city full of dreamers, she clung with such fierceness to an obviously fragile dream. When I thought of that, she struck me as about the most impermanent person I could imagine in the world.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">From one angle, Emma is the embodiment of “appalling, cruel, perfect egocentricity”—the egocentricity of the Hollywood dream. From another, she is the prisoner of her dream, “helpless” under its power: Because she is so desperate to be “noticed” by someone—a yearning that she traces to wanting to be noticed by God as a child—she is in danger of evanescing if no one does. Resonantly for our own moment, Emma comes to approach her life transactionally, with her young teenage girl’s body being the most prized commodity she has to offer. In a literally bruising arc, she both achieves her dream and is made unrecognizable to herself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>The Slide Area</em>’s hedonists are also forced to grapple with getting what they wished for. Although the main hedonists—the sun-loving Mark and the ever-drifting Clyde—happen to take male partners, the novel takes their sexual orientation in stride: Rather than dramatize, say, how queer Angelenos were subject to police raids on their gathering places, <em>The Slide Area</em>’s queer characters are not particularly embattled or anguished because of their choice of intimate partners. (In a 1970 interview, Lambert said, “The only works of art that treat the subject of homosexuality are the works of art that <em>don’t </em>‘treat’ it. I believe in a novel or a play that doesn’t make a point of the character being homosexual.”) If they struggle, as Mark does, with his “stupid unpromising life,” that is because, having shucked off the models of success passed down from their parents’ generation, they are engaged in the elusive project of making happiness sustainable. In Clyde’s case, he suffers from a surfeit of opportunities for extending himself—a relationship with a devoted and more conventional male lover; a relationship with a more irascible and mercurial female lover; a lucrative partnership in his father’s talent agency that awaits him—and an utter lack of inner direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the tale of Clyde and his frustrated would-be lovers, <em>The Slide Area </em>explores the destructive edge of the search for pleasure. The sun-tanned, athletic Clyde has two features that give an extra charge to his interchanges with others: “deep rapt ultramarine eyes” and an “extraordinary smile” with a “quick nervous radiance.” (For the fortune-blessed Clyde, even his insecurities are radiant and work to deepen his charm.) Yet Lambert gives this section a subtly unusual structure: the narrator splits his time between the charismatic Clyde, unhappy with his lovers and unhappy without them, and the flavorless, homely Walt, who trails Clyde while never coming to grips with how he has lost himself in an ill-defined relationship that has cost him his self-respect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The curious effect of the storytelling is to drain Clyde of his charisma and to invest Walt with an enigmatic pathos. Clyde does not surprise: He is petulant, railing like Holden Caulfield against all the “phoneys” he meets, and leaving others to clean up the various messes that he makes. His inner restlessness is real, and not to be dismissed, especially since it speaks to a larger anomie among the golden boys of Los Angeles. But it is Walt, the lover as fan, whose fuzziness draws the narrator’s curiosity and sympathy. Their last conversation is both meandering and poignant, as the abandoned Walt turns to thoughts of home and of escape. A seemingly random set of remarks from Walt as they drive along the coast—“My father used to play checkers in the evenings. I never could stand the game. They’ve had a lot of rainstorms in Ohio recently”—leaves us wondering what he left behind in Ohio, what he misses, and what he was trying to escape. There is a pause in the story: “This is the last remark he makes for some time,” the narrator tells us. Ever-discreet, he allows us to try to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>“<em>The Slide Area </em>was published to good reviews at the end of 1959,” Lambert wrote matter-of-factly in his memoir. It is a moment of extreme modesty, typical of Lambert’s own writing about himself, and one that deserves to be corrected by the historian. In fact, <em>The Slide Area</em>—bearing a strong pre-publication endorsement from Christopher Isherwood himself (“the most truthful stories about the film world and its suburbia I have ever read”)—was met with extraordinary acclaim by a set of reviewers who, even more remarkably, put their finger on the delicacy of Lambert’s accomplishment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the start, the novel<em> </em>was seen as a breakthrough depiction of Hollywood. “A brilliant piece of work, terse, compassionate, and beautifully made,” wrote the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>. “It earns a place on anyone’s shelves along with Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Last Tycoon </em>and Nathanael West’s <em>Day of the Locust</em>.” The novelist Kingsley Amis named the novel one of his favorite books of the year. Perhaps the most perceptive review came from Dilys Powell, the doyenne of British film criticism, in the film journal Lambert had previously edited. In <em>Sight and Sound </em>Powell called <em>The Slide Area</em> “the best fiction, the best book I have ever read about Hollywood,” and explained how it stood out from the pack:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The people who write about Hollywood, those who are not idolaters, are usually full of hatred; here is an author who has the faculty, rarer than you might suppose, of simply liking. Difficult to fault his style with its precise communication of inconsequent talk, its mingling of melancholy and wry fun. It is the strength of the book that it expresses not merely affection for the figures on the impermanent slopes, but a protective feeling which makes their danger the more touching.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented""><em>The faculty, rarer than you might suppose, of simply liking</em>: Powell captured how Lambert departed from the entrenched positions of writing about LA, the positions of LA’s boosters and its detractors. Instead he became a friend to the city—or, more specifically, a friend to those at risk in it. With the gifts of his meticulous attention and his discretion, he moved us to see them in full—the quality of energy they brought to their relationships; the gap between their self-image and their actions, sometimes absurd and sometimes horrible; their vulnerability—and to care for them in whatever way we chose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1963, in an essay on LA for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>, Lambert proposed that “Once you understand this place as a kind of Theater of the Absurd brought to life, you see both its appeal and its meaning.” This vision of the city—which drew out the incongruities on offer in it and refused to lampoon them—helped Lambert become one of the great chroniclers of LA on the page. In the realm of fiction, he aspired to compose “something loosely and very modestly Balzacian…[a] kind of Human Comedy,” and ended up completing what he called his “Hollywood Quartet,” comprised of <em>The Slide Area;Inside Daisy Clover </em>(1963), about a teenage movie star struggling to grow up in the teeth of the industry; <em>The Good-by People </em>(1971), an interlinked trio of novellas set in the aftershocks of the counterculture; and <em>Running Time </em>(1983), centered on the taut relationship between a Hollywood star and her mother. Meanwhile, Lambert distinguished himself as a biographer of silent and classic Hollywood, delving into industry archives and writing novelistically about the lives of Alla Nazimova, Norma Shearer, and his friend Natalie Wood. Between the subjects of Nazimova and Wood, he encompassed the entire span of stardom before the “New Hollywood;” ever-industrious, he also managed to complete books on the making of <em>Gone with the Wind</em> and the life of a fellow British screenwriter (<em>The Ivan Moffat File</em>). Shortly before Lambert’s death, in 2005, at 80, the film historian David Ehrenstein described him as “the person who probably knows more about the Golden Age of Hollywood than anyone else alive.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why, then, is Lambert himself a recessive presence in the literary history of Hollywood, with <em>The Slide Area </em>out of print in the US despite its regular presence on lists of the best Hollywood novels, and despite the welcome recent republication, by McNally Editions, of its companion novel <em>The Good-by People</em>?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It may be that the same qualities that make <em>The Slide Area </em>so special—its balance of acuity and discretion, its buoyancy, its trust in the capacity of its readers to come to their own judgments of the world it evokes—are also what make it untimely. With its focus on the human appetite for celebrity, the dream of being known and thereby loved, it forecasts our current world of influencers and other social-media personalities, but its sensibility is too wry to have even a whiff of self-promotion to it, and too generous to offer the pleasures of the savage takedown or the hot take. The novel is an artifact of another age, when a queer writer like Lambert might leverage an aesthetic of discretion to model for us how to be a certain kind of friend, never intimate but always on the level, and to draw us into a world of glimmering surfaces and uncertain depths, perfectly described but never judged.</p>

3543,"“Which Way Does Your Beard Point Tonight?”","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Walt Whitman’s sister-in-law Mattie </strong>gave birth to her second child in 1863, a healthy baby girl with gray eyes like her uncle Walt. “The new baby is immense, &amp; I take to her in proportion,” Whitman wrote to a friend. Mattie’s first child, Mannahatta (“Hattie” for short), was three years older and born around the time Whitman published the third edition of <em>Leaves of Grass. </em>Mannahatta<em>, </em>the Lenape name for Manhattan, appears fifteen times in the 1860 <em>Leaves</em>, and Whitman, proudly a New York poet, describes its poems as “Chants of the Mannahatta, the place of my dearest love.” It is likely, then, that Hattie’s uncle had something to do with her name. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Three years later, he had strong thoughts about what to call her new sister. “I want her to be called California,” continues Whitman’s letter. “She is fully worthy the name. She is large, calm, not pretty but something ahead of that, full of latent fire in the eyes.” Even after Mattie named her daughter “Jessie Louisa,” Whitman’s letters refer to her as “California,” until about the time the family relocated to St. Louis in 1868. “I got thinking last night about little California,” he wrote to his mother. “O how I wished I had her for an hour to take care of—dear little girl, I don’t think I ever saw a young one I took to so much.” Embodied in his young nieces, Mannahatta and California, representing (at least as far as uncle Walt was concerned) America’s east and west coasts, the poet pictured a softer Manifest Destiny, a fledgling future based on immense, familial love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The state of California was just five years old when he proclaimed himself the “comrade of Californians” in 1855. But the nascent state receives only passing mentions in the first two editions of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In 1857 Whitman had nothing short of “The Great Construction of the New Bible” in mind for his magnum opus—but in order to achieve this, <em>Leaves of Grass</em> would need to break out of New York. By the third edition of 1860, <em>Leaves of Grass</em> had grown from twelve, to thirty-six, to one-hundred-seventy-eight poems and as the book expanded, so did the range of Whitman’s vision. California’s presence grows to Whitmanic proportions alongside his beloved Mannahatta. “Take my leaves, America!” says the introductory poem. “Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring; / Surround them, East and West! for they would surround you.” His poems, he claims here, are children of America—like his nieces—and the 1860 <em>Leaves </em>revels in this “East and West” pairing, yawping across an entire continent to bring together the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, “spanning between them east and west, and touching whatever is between them.” An almost overpowering unifying impulse drives the New Bible. “Love” appears over one hundred and fifty times, not including its other conjugations, derivatives, and synonyms. During the Civil War, Whitman took a hiatus from <em>Leaves of Grass, </em>and a new edition did not go to print until 1867.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unity in a nation, as in a family, demands vigorous love to survive. The 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass </em>praises “California life” for “the stanch California friendship” and “the sweet air.” For <em>stanch, </em>the edition of Webster’s preferred by Whitman around the time offers “firm in principle; steady; constant and zealous; hearty.” A short poem captures how fervently Whitman wanted something of this California “stanchness” for himself, and how he might help nurture it:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">
    A promise and gift to California,<br>
    Also to the great Pastoral Plains, and for Oregon:<br>
    Sojourning east a while longer, soon I travel to you,<br>
    <br>
    to remain, to teach robust American love;<br>
    For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you,<br>
    <span style=""text-indent: 20px; display: inline-block;"">inland, and along the Western Sea,</span><br>
    For These States tend inland, and toward the Western Sea—and I will also.
</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">An early manuscript of the poem does not mention California at all; the “promise” is made to “Indiana, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and others,” states dubbed “the west” in early&nbsp; 19th century America. At some point before going to print, however, Whitman looked as far west as his eyes could go and California took the lead. His letters from the late ‘60s and early ‘70s anticipate the promised California sojourn, “a journey I have had in contemplation for several years, &amp; which has been two or three times fixed, but postponed,” he wrote in 1872. Sadly, his stroke in 1873 left him partially paralyzed and so the trip never came. He went there in his imagination, though, marking “The flashing and golden pageant of California” in “Song of the Redwood Tree,” first published in an 1874 issue of <em>Harper’s.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class=""wp-block-pullquote""><blockquote><p>His poems, he claims here, are children of America—like his nieces—and the 1860 <em>Leaves </em>revels in this “East and West” pairing, yawping across an entire continent to bring together the Atlantic and Pacific oceans</p></blockquote></figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">“A California song!” the poem opens in exclamation. “A prophecy and indirection—a thought impalpable, to breath, as air.” The number of surviving manuscripts related to this poem show something of Whitman’s preoccupation with the theme, with sorting out his idea of California. Like the 1860 poem, “Song of the Redwood Tree” also centers on a promise, only this time it is not the poet making a vow. It is not a promise <em>to, </em>but a promise <em>of. </em>Not a bond, but potential. While his earlier promise was to “teach robust American love,” by 1874 he saw the robustness of California’s passion—perhaps the 17,000 Californians who fought to preserve the Union convinced him (more Californians enlisted per-capita during the Civil War than in any other state). One can imagine uncle Walt looking into the face of his niece and whispering like a spoken lullaby his prophecy for the Golden State: “I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years... child of the real and ideal... the true America, heir of the past so grand, to build a grander future.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One hundred years after the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass, </em>one of those “heirs of the past” stood sighing in a supermarket in Berkeley, “what thoughts I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman....” Allen Ginsberg’s imagination places Whitman, “dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher” so naturally into a time and place the elder poet had never seen, “poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.” Fingering the pages of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Ginsberg holds Whitman to his promise to teach Californians “robust American love.” But America is not the same. Loneliness permeates. And in his grasping for Whitman among the “solitary streets” of California, Ginsberg asks “Which way does your beard point tonight?” He is  never given an answer.</p>

<p><strong>Los Angeles is ugly.</strong> I tend to forget. I fly back from Texas and when the airplane lands, I am surprised again by the low-hanging smog and the unending strip malls. Miles and miles of pavement. “Not a pretty place to live,” I mutter, easing my rental car down a wide, choked freeway. Every time, I expect shimmering beaches, clear skies, and open roads but this place always disappoints. Everything is gray. The whole city is sharp angles and taillights. The Hollywood sign is smaller than it seems on TV. It’s always far away, like a vanishing point. I tell people that going back to California depresses me. This time especially, as I’m here for my grandfather’s funeral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, for a night, I linger in the city and play at glamor. I meet up with an old friend and we slip through the VIP entrance of a club in the hills of West Hollywood. That’s the thing about California: you’re always one fake name away from the life of your dreams. We drink vodka martinis on a rooftop terrace with a pool, pretending we are not who we are, but characters on a television screen.</p>

<p>In 2003, the year I turned thirteen in Northern California, <em>The O.C. </em>hit network television. Those rich and beautiful teenagers moved through the golden glow of Southern California. They hooked up with each other, drank vodka from the bottle, and drove Range Rovers. Buffered by wealth, they functioned with the autonomy of adults. For all the soap opera drama in their lives, it seemed aspirational.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must have had <em>The O.C.</em> in mind—the casual loveliness of Marissa Cooper and Summer Roberts—when my high school best friend Bella and I laid out in bikinis, shivering in cool spring sunshine. We were Northern California girls, from the green hills above San Francisco, and I was longing for an adulthood that seemed synonymous with faraway Southern California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The beaches of Northern California are rocky and cold, so we positioned our lounge chairs next to her dad’s pool. Sunlight fell patchy through the densely foliaged oak trees but it hardly mattered. I wouldn’t have known what to do with a tan if I had managed to get one. My body was alien to me still. Tan skin as an end goal was vague and meaningless. All of it arbitrary. The point was not being tan, but being the kind of woman who tanned. I was performing “California girl” as I understood it then.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When strangers ask where I’m from, I lie. Instead of saying California, I pretend to disown all of it. My grandfather arrived in the Bay Area from Massachusetts, on a merit scholarship to Stanford, at a time when California gleamed like a beacon to the country’s best and brightest. The year was 1947, right smack in the middle of Hollywood’s Golden Era. California must have seemed bountiful then. Nothing ended, nothing died.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, there is never enough. Not enough jobs in the Central Valley. Not enough housing in the Bay Area. Not enough water in the Los Angeles Basin. People stream out of the state, manifest destiny reversed. I am just one more expatriate watching California on a screen. My embarrassing secret is I’ve never stopped thinking of those depictions as a map back home to a moment when the future seemed uncomplicatedly good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recently, in the humid summers of Austin, Texas, I had been watching <em>The O.C. </em>on repeat. When I watched the show, my life back in California seemed more saturated in my mind. I remembered myself as narratively important, like I, too, was once a main character. My childhood memories dimmed against the vividness of the screen. More than homesick, I became nostalgic: Crab and brie phyllo on a catering tray. Hot hiss of a straightening iron. Flask sloshing inside a quilted Chanel purse. Creamy orange sunsets over an infinity pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I taught myself how to curl my hair at 15 using a photo spread in <em>YM</em> magazine. Mischa Barton was the model, culturally relevant as a star of <em>The O.C.</em>, her blonde hair in thick ringlets. The magazine called it an easy hairstyle, “style and go in less than ten minutes,” perfect for Monday mornings before class. At 6 am, I worked the wide-barreled curling iron awkwardly, burning the edges of my face. My curls always limp before the first-period bell.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The summer before junior year, Bella and I threw a pool party in her backyard. We invited boys with floppy, full hair who came and kicked a soccer ball around on the wide lawn. We lounged in our American Eagle bikinis and Rainbow flip-flops. There was no alcohol in our world yet, just warm Pepsi and Starbucks lattes. I shuffled mix CDs labeled with Sharpie, curating the music of our high-school experience as if to remake it in the image of what I had seen on screen. Death Cab for Cutie. Phantom Planet. Spoon. I burned with a sense of arrival. The aspiration of my adolescence stretched toward belonging, safety, and possibility that my adult nostalgia still reaches back for today.</p>

<p>When <em>The O.C. </em>first came on the air, YouTube didn’t exist and Google was only six years old. San Francisco was still funky, Northern California was out, and frothy Southern California was the cultural center of the world. Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton bought low-rise jeans and baby tees at Kitson. Artifacts I will associate with womanhood forever—strapless dresses, pastels, and stiletto heels—were the popular styles. The economy was expanding. The housing market had not yet crashed. The whole world was awash in body glitter and I was a young teen playing at adulthood for the first time. It might have been the last moment in history when it was possible to believe earnestly in the upward mobility of the American dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over four seasons, <em>The O.C. </em>follows teenager Ryan Atwood as he moves from the “slums” of Chino to the gated communities of Orange County. The dividends for moral goodness are paid in Range Rovers and Juicy tracksuits, a distinctly Californian fable. In the world of the show, there is always — with the right combination of luck and hard work — the opportunity to become someone completely new. If this is the American ethos, it somehow feels even more true in the land of the Gold Rush and the Tech Boom. The newest of the new money where millionaires are made overnight. A land of equal opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whenever I am back in California, I can almost remember what it felt like to believe that.</p>

<p>I was living in Washington when the October 2017 Northern California Fire Storm arrived. The Tubbs Fire. The Atlas Fire. The Nuns Fire. A convergence of flame that sprawled, uncontained, for 23 days. The dry foothills burned hot and fast. Fires ripped through residential neighborhoods in the night, killing entire families as they slept. One woman survived by climbing into her swimming pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the following days, cars lined up at the gas pumps like a movie rendering of the apocalypse and not the apocalypse itself. My mom and her husband fled, driving past walls of flame in their Prius. When she called me, we wondered how my grandfather could be evacuated if needed; he was frail and already disoriented even within the familiar walls of his home. My high school boyfriend, captain of the baseball team back when our lives felt like a teen drama, drove by my mom’s every morning to check on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Improbably, my childhood home was still standing. With so many of the oak trees destroyed, the valley looked unfamiliar. My hometown gone up in wildfire smoke.</p>

<p>Joan Didion, in her 2003 book <em>Where I Was From</em>, grapples with the myth of California. From New York, she interrogates her memories against the realities of the state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Sacramento native, Didion describes California with a reverence that only seems possible from a distance. She describes “yearning for California” from the Vogue office in New York, and “writing the novel that would put such a protective distance between me and the place I came from,” as if the California of her first book, <em>Run River</em>, would necessarily come to supersede the California of her reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even as she wrote to deconstruct the myth of California, Didion affirmed it. Though she confessed to homesickness, she did not write generously about the state while she lived there. <em>Slouching Toward Bethlehem</em> rails against the false promise of the Haight-Ashbury hippies. <em>The White Album</em> is as tense as Didion herself, bristling with the violence of the Manson murders and the taut politics of the 1970s. The texture of her unsettled mind and the texture of California blur. This, too, is a false place.</p>

<p>In Los Angeles, I say goodbye to my friend and drive east toward the desert. Somewhere along the road, I stop for tacos. There’s a television in the restaurant and the man next to me at the counter wants to talk about the football game. The Dallas Cowboys are playing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“That’s my team,” I tell him, though I have no interest in sports. It’s this new identity as a Texan that thrills me, as if my cowboy boots give me a new perspective on the world.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tomorrow, my mother and I will scatter my grandfather’s ashes in a private and unfamous part of the state. A place I have never seen on screen. But tonight, driving through the desert east of Los Angeles, it is as if I’m cosplaying California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had forgotten the cotton candy colors of the sun setting over the ocean. The briny smell of the air. Gas almost six dollars a gallon. These experiences are novelties to me now. I am a tourist in my home state, free to enter the myth of California itself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the windows down, I play the theme song from <em>The O.C.</em>, with its wailing repetition of “California, here we come.” An invocation. I play it on loop until it becomes the soundtrack. My California flicks past like a movie montage. This California is not on fire, this California is always golden.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>“WHAT DO WE CARE? ANYWHERE WE CHOOSE.”</strong> Those are the fated words of Frank Chambers in <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em>, James M. Cain’s 1934 novel about a drifter who turns up at a roadside diner-service station on the outskirts of Los Angeles and shacks up with the proprietor’s wife. Although <em>Postman</em> masqueraded as a hard-boiled tale of adultery and punishment, sultry currents of resentment, restlessness, and disastrously fulfilled wishes bubbled just underneath. A sensational bestseller, <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> was a critical success that seemed to expose some long-suppressed primal truth about the American character.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the midpoint of the Depression and a number of Americans, including the no-longer-young like Frank Chambers, were still feeling confined by their circumstances, despite the results of the 1932 presidential election. Many of them longed for some sort of retribution, and if they couldn’t get it—escape. And escape they got. Radio thrust the disembodied voice into homes, where words floated in air like biblical pronouncements. Comic books brought ironies to life in swatches of primary colors and exclamation points. And the newspapers, in their notionally no-nonsense style, reported on a new<br>type of violent criminal: the roving bank-robber. Tales of Dillinger, Bonnie &amp; Clyde, and the FBI’s Most Wanted list foisted big personalities and small towns into public consciousness. Everyday, as it shattered another limit imposed by time and space, America grew just that little bit smaller.</p>

<p>A growing array of colorful, gimmicky signage battled for everyone’s attention, hawking products and perspectives to anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear: WALK A MILE FOR A CAMEL; NEW FORD V-8; FREEDOM, OPPORTUNITY, PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY—IT’S THE AMERICAN WAY! As the decade marched on, the experience intensified, forcefully mounting like a locomotive huffing and puffing to mechanical hoofbeats, hisses and whistles and static and chatter, Fireside Chats over the airwaves like Artie Shaw, Delta blues, and The Shadow; from the motormouth buzz of Howard Hawks to the syrupy fuzz of Clara Cluck, more and more a deluge of stuff, love songs and dance halls, typewriters, telegrams, and telephone calls, <em>Argosy</em>, <em>Black Mask</em>, and<em> Popular Western</em>, while candybars, hosiery, and aftershave-filled diesel trucks crisscrossed Works Progress Administration bridges all aboard that train of that swell of that coming American BOOM!</p>

<p>Edward Joseph Ruscha IV was born in the vast flats of Omaha, Nebraska, in 1937—the same year as Batman and <em>Look</em> magazine. The Ruschas moved to Oklahoma City when little Ed was four. His father, Ed Sr. (born in Missouri, whose father was born in Missouri, whose father’s father was born in Missouri), worked for the Hartford Insurance Company. In Ruscha’s words, Ed Sr. “made very little money, but he had a modest expense account and a company car,” and once a year the family would go on a road trip. Regular drives into John Ford country, Monument Valley, the Grand Canyon, cactus plants, gnarled boulders, Redwood trees, California. “We never went east.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ruscha grew up Catholic and was drawn to the aesthetics of indoctrination—the vestments, the incense, the painted stations. He also drew cartoons, inducted into the practice by a neighbor kid two doors down who kept the whole history of Dick Tracy in a tin box. In 1954, at the age of 16, Ruscha hitchhiked across the country for the first time. The Eisenhower ‘50s were an age of unchecked abundance, characterized by a swarm of prospering Americans—desperate only two decades ago—hitting the Interstate Highways for the newly-risen suburbs with a hankering for white-picket fences and Pontiac Catalinas. The clothes were better, the food more conveniently packaged, and the cars were—like Gothic cathedrals of yore—the supreme creations of the era. By 18, Ruscha was determined to become a commercial illustrator and applied to the illustrious ArtCenter College of Design in Los Angeles. Along with his close friend Mason Williams (a folk and country-singing guitar player), he packed his belongings into a 1950 Ford sedan and left Oklahoma City in 1957 along Route 66, burning quarts of oil all the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ruscha was not accepted to ArtCenter. Instead, he enrolled at the Chouinard Institute (now CalArts) down the street from MacArthur Park and moved into a small apartment he shared with three other artists on Sunset Place, off Hoover. At Chouinard, Ruscha’s courses in fine art emphasized spontaneity and gesture, while his design courses fostered precision and balance. The dueling forces of art and commerce quickly ushered in potent juxtapositions of high and low in his work, and he soon developed a hyper-precise style that aligned with the blossoming lushness of pop music—everyday experiences, highly produced.</p>

<p class=""indented"">For those less interested in blind consumption, postwar America’s rapid ascent was stultifying, and <em>Postman</em>’s Depression-era restlessness only intensified. The Beat movement, whose poetry and fiction was hellbent on expressing the alienation and struggle for some kind of spiritual connection in a conformist, consumerist society, would dive two-footed into a fomenting subculture, documenting its coast-to-coast romps through mythopoetic, bebop-infused language that flowed out as a sort of listicle for more primal, kinetic experiences—jazz clubs, dive bars, soda pop, fast cars. In California—the land the atom bomb built—these confluences found footing in the growing netherworld of Assemblage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps buoyed by its victory over the Axis powers, the United States had shed the baggage of its Anglo-European inheritance like a kid freshly 18 handed a new set of car keys. Just blow. As the ‘50s gave way to the ‘60s, American art grew increasingly self-referential. Consumer products, popular culture, and—its seductive shadow—outlaw culture, were now prime subject matter for artists everywhere invigorated by these high-low confrontations. Between 1954 and 1963, Ruscha too sharpened his attention to everyday objects, like signage and roadside architecture, through his almost compulsive road trips. Relentlessly documenting his experiences in drawings, jottings, and photographs, he worked toward a representation of the vernacular of the American West, one that was defined—from landscape to marketing copy—by spareness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1961, Ruscha embarked on a month-long tour of Europe. He photographed everything that grabbed his attention. Here was an American artist not as vassal but as tourist with a camera, merely remarking how, say, European speed limit signs were circular rather than square, how their cars too were rounded where Detroit’s were rectilinear. His profile began to rise around this time, thanks to works like <em>3223 Division</em> (39’ Ford) from 1960, <em>5 Cents</em> and <em>Actual Size</em> from 1962, and his participation the same year in key showings of the burgeoning West Coast and Pop art scenes—specifically Walter Hopps’s shows at the Ferus Gallery on La Cienega Blvd. and “New Paintings of Common Objects” at the Pasadena Art Museum. But 1963 is the year of Ruscha’s ascendancy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In ‘63 alone, <em>Esquire</em> would publish two of the New Journalism’s seminal texts: Terry Southern’s “Twirlin’ at Ole Miss,” a jocular exploration of racial tensions in the South under the cloak of a college baton-twirling competition; and Tom Wolfe’s “Tangerine Flake Streamline Baby,” a journey into Southern California’s Kustom Kulture—hot rods, tattoos, and masterful metal flake paint jobs (a movement that had seeped into Ruscha’s world through the works of peer Billy Al Bengston). Dennis Hopper, one foot in the Method world of James Dean and Marlon Brando, another in the exploding West Coast art scene, would hit the road with his 35mm Nikon and capture everything from Hells Angels at a diner to Martin Luther King, Jr.’s March on Washington. And Ruscha, having traveled up and down Route 66 between Oklahoma City and LA for years to visit his parents, would publish arguably the first modern artist book: <em>Twentysix Gasoline Stations</em>. Twenty-six (because he liked the sound of the words) stark, black-and-white photographs of service stations from Los Angeles to OKC to Groom, Texas, plainly captioned with name and location, granting the work a “factual kind of Army-Navy data look,” as Ruscha described it. According to Johanna Drucker in <em>The Century of Artists’ Books</em>, the photographs “combined the literalness of pop art with the minimalist [ironies] of repetitive sequencing”; most importantly, however, they set the blueprint for his most famous works: the Standard Station series.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Debuting in 1963 with <em>Standard Station, Amarillo, Texas</em>, the Standard Station series depicts, in a range of flat, impeccable colors, a Standard gasoline station that slashes the canvas diagonally in half through a dramatic use of perspective. They are large, and disorienting when viewed at scale. “It has to be called an icon,” Ruscha deadpanned to Paul Karlstrom in the early 1980s, speaking to the word’s Christian meaning. “That gas station had a polished newness that I just had to paint.” It’s a series he would continue to paint in endless variations until 2011, one that helped cement Pop art as the dominant art movement of the moment, and further launch California (specifically Los Angeles) into the artistic mainstream. Having introduced his stark, Soviet Constructivist-inspired use of perspective in 1964 with <em>Norm’s, La Cienega, On Fire</em>—which set his all-night hangout aflame—the Standard Station paintings and screenprints encapsulate the American West as a tale of scale, migration, and heavy industry, all at once.</p>

<p>Ruscha’s six-decade (and counting) career of depicting the defining features of modern American society—consumerism, pop culture, the commercial landscape, the American English language—was on display in “ED RUSCHA / NOW THEN,” his first cross-media retrospective in over twenty years. Starting out at the Museum of Modern Art New York before heading to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, “NOW THEN” featured over 200 works—including paintings, photographs, drawings, and artist books—to spotlight Ruscha’s understated yet indefatigable dynamism.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pairing mediums as diverse as gunpowder, chocolate, and blood with evocatively droll titles like “Two Sheets with Whiskey Stains,” “Pepto Caviar Hollywood,” and “I’ll be getting out soon and I haven’t forgotten your testimony put me in here,” Ruscha’s body of work captures something quintessential about the American experience that is almost as intangible as electricity itself, as full of discordant vitality as Frank Chambers. His pieces are both a part of and a comment on the postwar explosion, a heady time when even the limits imposed by the laws of nature seemed no match for the boundless enthusiasms of American capitalism. They are also snapshots of that moment when the United States—and particularly California—each came into their own, the crest of a vital, if only momentary, monoculture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet Ruscha, whose life seems to embody and incriminate something terminal about the American West, filters his America through a lens only California—with its wicked ironies—could provide. In his landmark study, <em>The Invention of the Western Film</em>, Scott Simmon identifies the West’s long-held cruel politics of space: “Empty land is there for the taking.” Ruscha sets his darkly comic vignettes in a setting imbued with that kind of force, and he pokes fun at it, at the absurdity of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1964 he paints <em>Hurting the Word Radio (#2)</em>, where he disfigures letters with metal calipers on a sky blue background reminiscent of a Technicolor western. In 1967 he publishes <em>Royal Road Test</em>, a forensic investigation of a typewriter destroyed along Highway 91, 122 miles southwest of Las Vegas. In 1973 he paints the word EVIL in his own blood on a blank, crimson background. Empty space always appears stalked by violence. Intrigued by oblique perspectives and ironic juxtapositions, he is almost preternaturally disposed to dialectical expression, to identifying, in direct imagery, the contradictions invigorating the land abutting the Pacific. He’s called the brilliant sunsets of the West “anonymous backdrops for the drama of words.” Words. Perhaps, having lived through the ballooning century of <em>stuff</em>, Ruscha’s secret message—the key to that tattered, traveling copy of Popular Western hidden throughout his works—is this: “Words live in a world of no size.”</p>

3593,"In Conversation: Corrina Gould","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">This past August, I caught up with Corrina Gould, a distinguished leader and spokeswoman for the Confederated Villages of Lisjan, a territory that includes Alameda, Contra Costa, Solano, Napa, and San Joaquin. With the long-standing goal of preserving and advocating for the cultural heritage and rights of her community, Gould has played a pivotal role in numerous conservation efforts, culminating in the recent success around the preservation of the historic Berkeley Shellmound. In our conversation, we delved into the rich history, cultural significance, and ongoing preservation initiatives related to the Huichiun territory and the Lisjan people.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>LORENZO LEWIS: </strong>Tell us what your role entails, what it means to you personally, and how you got involved?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CORRINA GOULD: </strong>I wear a number of different hats. I am the tribal chair for the Confederated Villages of Lisjan Nation, whose territory we’re on. I’m also the co- founder and co-director of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, the first urban Indigenous women’s land trust in the country. I’m also a mom and a grandmother, and I sit on a number of boards in the Bay Area. But I came to this work because it is what our ancestors were calling us to do. For years, we watched as development was happening in the Bay Area and many of our burial sites were destroyed. As that was happening, we realized that people didn’t know anything about the generic word, “Ohlone,” that children learn about in fourth grade—and they absolutely didn’t know anything about the shellmound or the burial sites of the people that were still here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today we see all kinds of buildings going up in the Bay Area. Same thing was happening in the late ‘90s when a lot of money came in from Silicon Valley. Two hundred years ago, none of this stuff was here. There were no asphalt roads or buildings, but above the ground stood the mounds, and our ancestors used them for thousands of years not just to bury, but to create village sites, to send signals across the Bay, and to really remember the ancestors. These mounds are connected to our cosmology stories. And so I’ve taken this work as an opportunity to talk about the Bay Area in a different kind of way, to show who we were and to really awaken the consciousness of the Bay Area about Ohlone people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what do we do about all the ancestors that are now at UC Berkeley? Imagine your ancestors’ cemeteries being destroyed by universities and museums. Imagine putting your ancestors in boxes or on racks, or leaving them exposed after construction. UC Berkeley destroyed our burial sites to study our people and because we are not a federally recognized tribe, we don’t have the same rights. So we’ve been trying to figure out different ways of using federal law to get our ancestors returned and to put them back in the land in a dignified manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beth Rose Middleton, a professor at UC Davis, wrote <em>Trust in the Land</em>, which talks about creating a Native land trust. When you have no other way of getting land put into trust for a tribe, this is a mechanism we can use. A legal mechanism to put Native land back into Native hands, and a way for us to begin to reimagine what our responsibilities are to this land and waterways that our ancestors have been a part of since the beginning of time. But it also gives us a way to reimagine bringing those ancestors home after all this time. It’s time for them to come home, not just for Lisjan people, but for everyone in the Bay Area. It allows us a time to heal together, a time for us to really imagine bringing dignity back and to talk about a history that’s painful but also something that interweaves beautiful stories about resiliency and survivance. I got involved because it’s my responsibility. I was born with that responsibility. I raised my children here and now my grandchildren are here. Many people have helped us along the way—allies and accomplices that have stood with us on these walks to preserve and protect sacred sites, and to do what we are being called to do in this time of great change in the world.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">I learned that there are an estimated 425 distinct Shellmound sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Could you give us a brief history of the Berkeley Shellmound and its cultural significance?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The West Berkeley Shellmound is blocks and blocks long. The oldest site that we fought and won over the last eight years is on Fourth St. It’s the first place our ancestors were directed to create a place to bury our people. It’s directly aligned with Alcatraz Island. Alcatraz Island is not an island that our ancestors went to. Although we were great fishermen and our tule boats were super fast on the bay’s currents, we didn’t go there because it was decided that that particular island was where our ancestors would rest once they passed away, that their spirits would rest there for four days. Our responsibility is to have a ceremony for them on the shores, and on the evening of the fourth day, as the fire is going down, as the sun is setting, we believe our ancestors leave through the western gate which is now where the Golden Gate Bridge is.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These places that everybody sees today in the Bay Area, these landmarks have been landmarks for thousands of years—for us and our belief systems. The West Berkeley Shellmound triangulates with two other sacred sites in Berkeley that you can’t see from that area anymore, but if you know where Indian Rock is, that is a place where we had ceremonies on top of the world. This also triangulates to UC Berkeley where another shellmound sits. Strawberry Creek runs straight across the West Berkeley Shellmound area that we take care of today. If you could imagine where the railroad tracks are all the way down to Second Street, that was all a part of the village site as well as blocks all the way up to at least Fifth Street. and over past University about four or five blocks. So this was a huge village site. Hundreds of people lived there. The bay came all the way up to where the railroad tracks are today. Imagine the Bay Area with no electricity. Only stars. And at night on the tops of these mounds there would be fires that were lit, and you could see your neighbors across the bay, and know where you are by seeing the fires rising out of their village site. It was a different way of living. So the West Berkeley Shellmound was absolutely something that we had to save.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Can you talk about Native perseverance and survival through the horrific challenges brought on by settler violence and genocide?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean, first of all, I think that Americans can’t wrap their heads around this idea that America was just one piece of land, and colonizations were happening at the same time on different parts of what is now called America. In 1776, when they were signing the Declaration of Independence on the East Coast, it was just then that the Spanish started to create their missions in San Francisco. The Spanish came with this idea of holding down land. And when they came, it was really because they were afraid that the Russians were going to take the land they called dibs on, and so what the Spanish decided to do was send missionaries here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Catholic Church had set up missions in Central and South America as a way to hold down the land, to suck out resources like gold and silver, and as a way to enslave Native people to work in the mines and huge ranchos. There were twenty-one missions started in San Diego and worked their way up to Solano. My ancestors were enslaved at two of those missions: Mission Dolores in San Francisco and Mission San Jose in Fremont, California. The Spanish brought with them diseases. They brought with them murder. They brought a prison system. They brought slavery. They brought rape. And so there was a huge switch and change in our lives. The people that were brought into these missions hadn’t seen a lot of this stuff in their lifetime. It was something new. It’s like seeing a scary movie, but you’re in it and you can’t escape it. And even if you decided “I don’t want to be here” and you went back to a village site that you knew, they would chase you down. And if the village wouldn't give you up, they would burn the entire village down. Once baptized, you became their property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We, as the survivors, are holding those kinds of stories in our DNA and are trying to get past it and survive it. The best way to do that is to reconnect with the land and the language and our stories and tell the truth about it. It was 99 years that the Spanish were holding down the land and they brought in not just the Ohlone people but the Bay Miwok People, Plains Miwok People, Delta Yokut People, and the Patwin People. The Confederated Villages of Lisjan Nation today is a confederation of all those people that were brought into those missions because they intermarried and they exchanged songs and dances and traditional medicines. It’s why our territory is so huge. So many people were brought in and died by the thousands when the missions were here. After 99 years, the Spanish lost the war to Mexico and the missions became secularized. The land was divided up between the Mexican soldiers that fought in the war, and so my ancestors went from being slaves at the missions to being slaves at these large ranchos. After the United States won the Mexican-American war, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed. In that treaty it said that California natives were supposed to receive some land back, but true to the United States never honoring their commitments, it was never fulfilled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>California was created because of the gold rush. The first laws of extermination happened in California. Not everyone rushing to find gold could find gold here, but they could find villages of native people hiding out. And they could hunt down the adults and get $5 a head and 25 cents an ear. They could sell the children in town: $250 for a little girl, $180 for a little boy. Then they created vagrancy laws, which made it illegal for Native people to be “vagrants.” So slavery was alive and well in the state of California for Native people. And it’s something that's not talked about in history books.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So our people hid in plain view. They learned Spanish at the missions and by working at the ranchos. My ancestors pretended to be Mexican and worked on ranches in Pleasanton, California, and other places, dispersing among the rest of the population so they wouldn't be hunted down.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">I wanted to talk about rematriation, what it means to you now that the land has been returned. Can you elaborate on your vision?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rematriation is about looking at the whole and looking at future generations. It’s about asking, How do we maintain the right relationships and come into the right relationships with the earth again? How do we ensure that the next seven generations are going to have good air to breathe and good soil to grow food in and have good water to drink? It’s about bringing us back into being whole human beings again. It’s about remembering our responsibilities. It’s about taking care of all of our relatives, not just our human relatives, but our more-than-human relatives as well. How do we as human beings survive this earth? The earth will survive without humans. But will humans survive if we don’t sit down and actually do the work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it’s our opportunity to do that. It’s our opportunity to bring back songs for the medicines and the waters. It’s our time to remind our sons and our brothers and our uncles and our fathers and our nephews that it’s okay for them to let go of the things that were given to them during colonization. A lot of Indigenous cultures are matriarchal societies. The women make the decisions and the men have their own sacred responsibilities. Colonization has taken those responsibilities away from men and from women. When colonization happened, the first thing they took was the sacred. The second thing they took was matriarchy. Now we need to ask: How can we fix it so it will save all of us?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where do you take your relatives that want to learn about the history of the first people? There is no place to do that. The West Berkeley Shellmound would be a place to do that—it’s accessible and it’s a place for us to celebrate who we are alongside our allies and accomplices.</p>

<p>Oh, there’s all kinds of ways that you can help. Anybody can help. Sogorea Te’ Land Trust is now taking care of about eight different places and we’re always looking for volunteers. You can go to volunteers at <a href=""http://createtheland.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">createtheland.org</a> and sign up. The website is full of resources and talks and books and articles. It’s a living website. There are always important times for us to do clean-up days. We’re always looking for folks to put their hands in the soil, but if you have other ideas for ways to help—if you have skills that you want to bring to the work, and if you want to know more about the West Berkeley Shellmound, go to <a href=""http://shellmound.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">shellmound.org</a>. If you live, work, or play in the five Bay Area counties that our people are from, you can support the rematriation work by paying the Shuumi land tax. There’s a donation place on the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust website where you can fill out this beautiful little form: whether you rent or own, how many bedrooms you have, etc., and it’ll give you a suggested donation. We really encourage people to do that. It’s a great way to be in partnership with us if you can’t come out to the land. We’re always looking for opportunities to work with other people, to create collaborations, to make Ohlone people visible again in the different Bay Area counties. That’s what Sogorea Te’ is becoming known for: creating relationships with other people to do this good work, because we can’t do it by ourselves.</p>

3598,"Asserting a Traditional Japanese Self","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Chikaji Kawakami (1882 - 1949) spent over three years</strong> painting watercolors of life while incarcerated at two internment camps for people of Japanese descent during World War Two. These paintings appear simply as delicate Western-style watercolors of a quiet life at a detention camp. But, from the point of view of an older Issei, or first-generation Japanese immigrant, Kawakami’s work responds to the war and the devaluation of Japanese culture by asserting a Japanese identity rooted in a traditional classical past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Guest Curator of the Monterey Museum of Art, I curated a selection of 40 of these paintings for <em>Under the Guard Tower: Chikaji Kawakami Watercolor Paintings</em> (August 22—December 15, 2024). Kawakami was 60 years old, a widower and a single parent of six children under the age of 19 when he was deported to Tanforan Racetrack Detention Center in April 1942. His incarceration followed Executive Order #9066 that made enemy aliens of all people of Japanese descent. As a result, 120,000 people—two-thirds of them American citizens—were forced out of their homes and incarcerated for the duration of the war at camps located in isolated places known for their harsh environment, primarily in the Western part of the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since his arrival from Japan in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1904 at the age of 22, Kawakami had endured for almost 40 years the marginal life of the non-citizen living under a strong anti-Asian climate which had impeded Japanese from becoming American citizens. He had survived in the shadows of the networks created by Japanese immigrants whose insularity had made them the least acculturated immigrant group in the US. While he had studied art in Japan, and painted during his spare time, he didn’t live the life of an exhibiting artist, mixing with members of the Japanese artist community in the Bay Area. Instead, he survived as a porter, a motorcycle repairman, and, just before his deportation to the camps, running his own dry-cleaning service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His artistic life took a dramatic shift at the camps when, for the first time since his arrival from Japan, he dedicated his time fully to painting. Encouraged by the community of fellow Issei artists at the camps, first at Tanforan and then later in Utah’s Topaz Incarceration Center, Kawakami benefited from the art school for the incarcerated under the direction of Chiura Obata, a well-known Japanese artist and professor at UC Berkeley. Obata advocated art as a way of overcoming the tribulations of unjust incarceration. He saw in art a way of finding peace and calmness at such a troubling time. Eventually, Kawakami became an art instructor at the school during his stay at Topaz.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kawakami belonged to a generational group that was the most vulnerable because as non-citizens they were the enemy. They felt the most conscious of their cultural background, with traditional aspects of Japanese culture forbidden by the authorities. Among these were any form of allegiance to the emperor, the use and teaching of the Japanese language, the practice of the Shinto religion, martial arts, and the practice of certain Buddhist rituals. In addition, the US government engaged in an anti-Japanese campaign to portray the Japanese as animals, feeble and weak. Confronted with the devaluation of Japanese culture, the Issei responded by reviving and practicing traditional Japanese arts and crafts in the camps. At Topaz, for example, classical Japanese arts were practiced, such as classical dance and the use of the musical instruments of <em>shamisen</em> and <em>koto</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two of Kawakami’s paintings made at the camps, a self-portrait and a painting of a guard tower, express directly a Japanese identity and also his views about the war. Kawakami painted the self-portrait soon after his arrival to Tanforan in which he depicts himself dressed in a kimono holding a <em>biwa</em>, a musical instrument favored during the Tokugawa period but no longer in vogue in contemporary Japan. This portrait was daring in the context of the war since any associations with traditional Japan was seen as subversive because of their perceived loyalty to the emperor. This painting asserts Kawakami’s identity as a traditional man, but also acts as a counter image to the negative depiction of the Japanese by the US authorities, presenting himself as a calm, educated, and artistic man.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">While Kawakami created several paintings of the guard tower using a Western style of painting, one stands out because of his use of <em>haiga</em>, a 17th century style which combines a haiku with a <em>sumi-e</em> painting. Instead of writing his own haiku, Kawakami breaks from tradition by copying a well-known one by the 17th century poet Bashō and illustrating it with a <em>sumi-e</em> painting of one of the guard towers at Topaz. The poem addresses the futility of war by comparing the leaves of summer with the fading memory of dead soldiers. This <em>haiga</em> can be interpreted as Kawakami’s commentary on the war. It also could be seen as his reflection on the death of James Wakasa, a 67- year old man shot and killed by a Topaz guard who claimed he was trying to escape. The event shook the Topaz inmates, who had long expressed fear of the guards’ anti- Japanese attitudes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kawakami’s paintings at Tanforan and at Topaz provide a restrained visual documentary of life at these camps that differ from other internees’ artworks. They show scenes of life only from outside the barracks, and from the perspective of somebody observing from a distance. Small groups of people, whose facial features are not shown, promenade in alleys bathed in morning light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The paintings, as visual documentary of life at the camps, spare the viewer the crowded and unsanitary living conditions inside the barracks, as depicted by internee artists Miné Okube and Chiura Obata. At Tanforan, for example, internees were housed in converted horse stalls which barely covered the stink of the horse manure. At Topaz, people lived in poorly constructed barracks without insulation, and without privacy—entire families lived in crowded places separated only by hanging sheets and used latrines and showers without walls. He does not show the emotional climate of the internees, having forcibly left their homes for barbed wire and armed soldiers. While Kawakami’s restraint could be understood as an aesthetic choice or fear of censorship, it could also be interpreted as a desire to give his subjects three important commodities at the camps: space, privacy, and a dignified presentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This restraint is also seen in his landscape paintings of the areas surrounding the camps (the largest group of paintings). They portray a subtle beauty, but they also depict a harsh environment. Topaz was in the middle of an arid desert with extreme heat in the summer and extreme cold in the winter. The area was also affected by winds that blew constantly, covering everything with dust. All the incarceration camps, with the exception of two, were located in arid and isolated places selected with the purpose of breaking the spirit of the incarcerated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did Kawakami—as well as other incarcerated artists—choose to depict the very same environment that caused them so much suffering? Traditionally, the painting of nature has been an important theme in Japanese art, where artists have focused on its beauty. Finding beauty in the place that gave them so much suffering was a defiant act of creativity, one that offered them a sanctuary from the ardors of their everyday life.</p>

<p>It’s an oddly literal way to interpret the idea that trucks are tough. Yes, durability is one form of toughness. But when people say “My truck is tough,” they inevitably mean something more ineffable than “My truck can take a bullet.” The truck is synecdoche for an entire lifestyle where men work with their hands in small towns across rural America. It’s not that the truck is tough—it’s that the driver is tough and requires a particular vehicle in which to be tough. He bales hay, spends Sunday morning at church, and drinks longnecks sitting on the tailgate.</p>

<p>But Cybertruck drivers don’t buy these futuristic trucks to haul stuff (they can’t) or tow stuff (they can’t)<strong><em>*</em></strong> or even offroad (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkfmDoF56w"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">they <em>can’t</em></a><em>)</em>. Instead, the Cybertruck offers a bulky unibody vehicle with metallic sci-fi paneling and a massive video touchscreen. It’s perfect for the growing share of truck shoppers who say they use their “truck” <a href=""https://www.axios.com/ford-pickup-trucks-history"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">for errands and commuting more than towing or hauling</a>. The same shoppers who say they want a truck that is “modern,” “sophisticated, and “technologically advanced” more than “functional” or “reliable.” The truck’s appeal—its meaning as a consumer good—was built, at least in part, on the sexiness of a particular kind of utilitarian masculinity. But Cybertruck people aren’t truck people. Because, practicality aside, trucks are utilitarian objects of conspicuous consumption that serve to signal the driver’s identity. Chevy Silverados remain the preferred choice for country boys who haul stuff, Ford F-150s still get the most country songs, and Toyota Tacomas are favored by outdoorsy types who refer to their trucks as “rigs.”</p>

Even its name is ill-fitting, a conceptual contradiction: “Cyber” and “truck” reach both forward and backward in time: the shiny surfaces of Silicon Valley’s contactless future meeting the utilitarian grit and endurance of America’s past.</p>

<p class=""indented"">“This is like Picasso,” Cybertruck owner Matt Holm told Texas Monthly. “When Picasso changed the language of art and started putting two eyeballs on chicks’ faces on one side, people were like, ‘This dude is r—ded, what the hell is wrong with this dude, right?’ Guess what history has decided? His art is kinda cool and valuable.” Here, Picasso is stripped of his context and leftist politics, and flattened, in a remarkable stroke of bro-speak, into a retroactive edgelord. And today, there is a kind of person who worships at the altar of provocation for provocation’s sake.</p>

<p>In an era when all consumer decisions are becoming increasingly politicized, the Cybertruck seems designed to piss someone off. Comparisons to a tank write themselves. And they aren’t far off the bat: the Cybertruck is a military vehicle for the culture war. Too flimsy for the Ford F-150 Republican and too encumbered by Musk’s increasingly belligerent politics for the EV Democrat, its meaning as a symbol has surpassed its meaning as a truck. With the Cybertruck, Tesla was trying to deliver a perfectly engineered concept of tomorrow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a review for The Autopian, David Tracy argues that the Cybertruck, with its brutalist design, delivered on that vision at the expense of build quality, maneuverability, usability, and visibility. Unlike a Model Y, it’s an identity statement precisely because it is impractical. To drive a Cybertruck is to buy into a particularly forceful techno-optomistic vision for the future. Thus, Tracy’s Cybertruck review managed to frustrate both Musk fans and haters. He followed it up with another article titled “<a href=""https://www.theautopian.com/reviewing-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-totally-pointless/"">Reviewing The Tesla Cybertruck Is Totally Pointless</a>,” acknowledging that the culture war had swallowed the Cybertruck whole. His mistake was setting out to review it as a <em>car</em>, isolating it from its creator. People already love or hate Musk, which means they already love or hate the Cybertruck. That means, he explains, that “neither group is going to actually read a Cybertruck review with an open mind, making my endeavor to write one—as previously stated—thoroughly <em>pointless</em>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Architectural critic Reyner Banham wrote of the contradiction contained within brutalism—which embodied both the authoritarian state and a utopian vision of communal living. Two different shades of social engineering. The Cybertruck, inspired by sci-fi stories that Musk himself loves, imposes itself in much the same way: a forceful interjection of one man’s futuristic fantasies. To accept the Cybertruck as a truck—despite all its futuristic contradictions—is to sign on for Musk’s personal and idiosyncratic utopia, even when it overrides a collective and shared understanding of trucks. Or a collective and shared understanding of utopia.</p>

<p><strong>On the 29th of May, 1453, Constantinople fell</strong> to the Ottoman Turks led by the sultan Mehmet II, the Conqueror. In the predawn, the walls of the fortress-city that had defied barbarian attacks for a thousand years were still unscaled, albeit battered by Turkish artillery. After seven weeks of siege the mood of the City was bleakly fatalistic. Its defenders were no more than 7,000, and they confronted a multinational force of 100,000 marshaled by the sultan: elite Janissaries, Anatolian Turks, and mercenary irregulars from Italy, Greece, Hungary, and the Slavic countries (many Christian), sent first into battle and hemmed in by military police.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost until the last hour it might have gone differently. News that a Venetian fleet was coming to Byzantium’s aid had unsettled Mehmet’s court—it was rumored already to be on the island of Chios. A papal league was forming to mount a new crusade, and the Turk’s armistice with the Hungarians was about to expire. On May 23rd, Mehmet, a headstrong youth of 21, sent an emissary—the son of a Greek renegade, as it happened—to the emperor Constantine XI Paleologus with an offer to lift the siege in exchange for an enormous annual tribute of 100,000 gold bezants, which he must have known was beyond the Empire’s means. Alternatively, upon surrender its remaining citizens would be spared to depart the City with their portable belongings, and the emperor himself was guaranteed safe passage to exile and a reduced domain in the Peloponnesus—all conditions that Constantine had no reason to believe Mehmet would actually honor. For his part the emperor offered to surrender everything he possessed except for Constantinople, which, Steven Runciman reminds us, was by this point the only thing he did possess. In that case, the sultan replied, the alternatives for the Byzantines were surrender, the sword, or conversion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the last negotiation. Yet, Mehmet countenanced the semblance of a debate in his inner council between his elderly vizier, Halil Pasha, who had always disapproved of the campaign, and a charismatic firebrand, Zaganos Pasha, who embraced it. Zaganos deprecated the Venetian threat and reminded the sultan, as if it were necessary, that his paragon, Alexander the Great, had conquered half the world with a much smaller army than his. The verdict and the pessimistic Halil’s eventual execution for treason were foretold by Mehmet’s private resolve that he would sit on Byzantium’s throne or be buried beneath its walls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At nightfall, May 28, Mehmet urged his vast army to return to their tents for rest and reflection. Disturbing the peace, a band of dervishes pounced on the camp to preach the advantages of martyrdom. “Yet Mohammed principally trusted to the efficacy of temporal and visible rewards,” notes Gibbon. “‘The city and the buildings are mine,’ said Mohammed, ‘but I resign to your valour the captives and the spoils, the treasures of gold and beauty; be rich and be happy.’”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In their last week of freedom the Greeks were beset with dismal omens, a mephitic fog and a partial lunar eclipse among them. The moon was the City’s ancient symbol, and on the night of the 28th the moon was a crescent. After addressing the “noblest of the Greeks and the bravest of the allies,” Constantine and a privileged handful of his commanders took communion at Hagia Sophia, the Church of the Holy Wisdom, the vastest place of worship in Christendom, and probably in the world; the best he could do, writes Gibbon, was to arm them with the “courage of despair.” Later that night the first and last truly ecumenical Christian service was held in the great church; quoting a modern historian, Jason Goodwin: “and everyone came, Catalan and Orthodox Greek, schismatic bishops and the unionist cardinal, Catholic and Orthodox priests, and all the people who were not at the walls received communion from whoever chose to administer it, and made confession, to whoever was ready to hear it.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The assault began at 01:30 in the morning, but without the usual frightful din of trumpets and kettle drums that announced a Turkish attack, leading some in the City to hope that it was simply a minor night attack. For seven weeks the siege of Constantinople unfolded. In the Golden Horn, Greeks and Turks engaged in a tight naval combat in which, for a long time, the Byzantines prevailed, showing their old cunning and armed with Greek fire (ancient napalm), but most crucially on the land walls. In both theaters Constantine’s strong right arm was a Genoese sailor and engineer, Giovanni Giustiniani Longo, a brave man of Ulyssean resourcefulness, who had brought with him 700 men in January; his particular expertise was the defense of walled cities, of which Constantinople was the greatest of all. Given charge of defending the fortifications, Giustiniani even contrived temporarily to disable the Turks’ biggest cannon, known as Urban, after its mercenary Hungarian designer. Giustiniani’s rising prestige and intimacy with the emperor aroused the enmity of Lucas Notaras, the Empire’s high admiral and megadux (grand duke), “whose ambition was not extinguished by the common danger”; he, the second man in Byzantium, and the Genoese hero indulged a feud in which, Gibbon notes, each accused the other of treachery and cowardice. Mehmet was envious of the emperor’s ingenious Italian. “What would I not give, to have that man in my service!”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The grand duke was also skeptical of Constantine’s loyal adherence to the union of the Greek and Latin churches that his brother John VIII Paleologus had negotiated; ratified at the Council of Florence in 1449, this desperate theological expedient was despised and ignored by his subjects, most emphatically the Latin services in St. Sophia. Or as Notaras quipped, unwisely, “Better the sultan’s turban than the cardinal’s hat.” Giustiniani was in the midst of the fighting at the Gate of St. Romanus when he was wounded by a Turkish bullet that penetrated his armor. According to Gibbon,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">The immediate loss of Constantinople may be ascribed to the bullet, or arrow, which pierced the gauntlet of John Justiniani. The sight of his blood, and the exquisite pain, appalled the courage of the chief, whose arms and counsels were the firmest rampart of the city. As he withdrew from his station in quest of a surgeon, his flight was perceived and stopped by the indefatigable emperor. ‘Your wound,’ exclaimed Paleologus, ‘is slight; the danger is pressing; your presence is necessary; and whither will you retire?’—‘I will retire,’ said the trembling Genoese, ‘by the same road which God has opened to the Turks,’ and at these words he hastily passed through one of the breaches of the inner wall.</p>

<p class=""unindented"">By a world-historical mischance (or was it merely that?), a little postern gate, which was said to have been forgotten by all except the old men, had been opened for a sortie, and not secured after. The Janissaries who tried the lock were surprised to find themselves pushing inside the city; routing the Greeks in the vicinity, they had raised Mehmet’s banner on the nearest towers. It was at this moment that Giustiniani was wounded. Close enough to witness the consternation caused by his ignoble retreat, Mehmet shouted, “The city is ours! It is ours already! See, there is no one left to defend it! Fear not! Follow me! The city is ours!”</p>

<p>The Empire had never recovered from the Fourth Crusade of 1204 when, rather than marching on to the Holy Land to battle the infidels, the crude nobility of the West (the counts of Flanders and the barons of France) allied with Venice to seize Constantinople from their fellow Christians. The Byzantines were, providentially for the plotters, embroiled in a typically complex dynastic struggle involving a titular emperor who was blind and in his dotage, a young pretender, a scheming courtier-turned-usurper, and a blinded boy prince languishing in prison. In the end the City was sacked; its citizens brutalized, hundreds of years of heaped-up treasures looted, with holy relics, of course, being the most sought after. The crude Baldwin of Flanders was proclaimed emperor, mounting the throne in looted regalia. Afterward, Greek princes maintained rival courts in Nicaea, Thessaloniki, Epirus, and Trebizon on the Black Sea; after fifty years the Latin usurpers were overthrown by Michael Paleologus, coming from Nicaea. With pitiful symbolism, as Steven Runciman epitomizes, “The last Latin Emperor in his extremity, after selling most of the relics to Saint Louis and before pawning his son and heir to the Venetians, had stripped the lead off all the roofs [of his palace] and disposed of them for cash.” After 1400 Constantinople was effectively encircled by the Turks, and would have come under their rule fifty years earlier if the world-shaking Tamerlane had not distracted—and almost destroyed—them at the battle of Ankara in 1402, where he captured the sultan Bayezit I, subsequently confining him in an iron cage; his vast pointless empire fell apart after his death, which came even as he was advancing an invasion of China.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Byzantium, where once foreign visitors had wondered at the crowded opulence, Spanish or Arab tourists in the mid-14th and 15th century were struck by the emptiness and dereliction. Whole districts of the City had contracted into little walled towns. Elegant waterside villas, rich monasteries, shopping centers or luxury-goods manufacturers had vanished, replaced by hovels and overgrown countryside, untended hedgerows, bramble, wild roses. In the abandoned Hippodrome, where for centuries the Greens and Blues had cheered their teams’ charioteers and periodically convulsed the City with their rivalry, young aristos played polo in a vast weedy field.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Constantinople went through the motions of Empire, but the jewels in the imperial diadems were glass or paste. Its trade and even its politics were dominated by foreign traders who battened on concessions: A century before it fell to the Turks, Gibbon writes, the Roman Empire was close to becoming a province of Genoa. In the end Byzantium’s glories were artistic and intellectual: Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who became Pope Pius II, wrote that in his day any Italian with scholarly pretensions would claim to have studied at the University of Constantinople. For all its decrepitude, the City, as a place and a polity, retained its imperial mystique, commanded as ever a superb physical situation, and would always have its geopolitical centrality as the gateway to the East and the hinge between Europe and Asia. When tempted with other riches, Mehmet insisted that the City was all he wanted.</p>

<p>The afternoon of May 29 found defeated allies, mostly Italian, swimming desperately to the Venetian and Genoese ships in the harbor. Turkish sailors marauded in the warehouses at the Golden Horn until they encountered and waylaid a little saint’s day procession consisting mostly of old women and a few old men, slaughtering the latter, and capturing the rest. It was a prelude to the mass looting and rapine which went on for most of the day. Of the last Byzantines, Cristopolos, a Greek renegade in the sultan’s service, recalled: “And some were massacred in their houses where they tried to hide, and some in churches where they sought refuge”; they suffered “stealing, disrobing, pillaging, raping, taking captive men, women, children, old men, young men, monks, priests, people of all sorts and conditions,” writes Gibbon, who expatiates on how fear and resignation had reduced the Byzantines to something like “a herd of timid animals.” Instinctively, from all the quarters they poured into St. Sophia, which was filled in an hour from the galleries to the nave, hopeful that the holiest of churches would protect them. They had always been a superstitious people, convinced that their City’s days were literally numbered with the reigns of all the emperors inscribed on occulted stones. Some of them, at least, were inclined to an invented tradition, “the prophecy of an enthusiast or imposter,” which had it that when the day came that Turks would invade the city, they would get no farther than Constantine’s column in the square facing St. Sophia: for an angel from heaven would deliver a sword to an ordinary man who would send the affrighted Turks flying, out of the West down to the East all the way to Persia. While the Byzantines expected the appearance of the “tardy angel,” the Turks axed through the cathedral’s locked bronze doors and began claiming what they had been promised, human and material, soldiers advancing on the altar in an iconoclastic fury, using their axes to destroy the sacred iconostasis where, just half a day before, the last emperor and his liegemen had prayed.</p>

<p class=""indented"">Gibbon: “Youth, beauty, and appearance of wealth, attracted their choice... In the space of an hour the male captives were bound with cords, the females with their veils and girdles. The senators were linked with their slaves; the prelates with the porters of the church; and the young men of a plebeian class with noble maids whose faces had been invisible to the sun and their nearest kindred.” But this rough democracy didn’t last. Soon enough, things were sorted out to the Conquerors’ satisfaction, as William Holton Hutton, later Dean of Winchester, dispassionately noted in 1900: “The usual fate of the Greek nobles however was that the fathers were slain, the boys taken to the barracks of the Janissaries and the women and girls to the harems of the sultan and his chief favorites. Some forty thousand Greeks perished during the siege, fifty thousand it is supposed became captives, ten thousand, it is possible, some few rich, most the very poor, retained their freedom if not their homes.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By mid-day the devastation in the oldest central part of the city was so complete, with blood spilling downhill from high Petra and broken limbs scattered everywhere, that Mehmet contravened Islamic law and declared the pillage over after a single day rather than the traditional three. Many parts of the once-vast metropolis had grown so distant and distinct that the Turks did not realize that they belonged to the City, and accepted their opportune surrenders, sparing them the worst of the pillage. With who knows what exactly on his mind, the young Conqueror rode through the gore to St. Sophia and, having modestly anointed his turban with a handful of dust, entered the church, pausing to rebuke a Turkish soldier who was hacking with his sword at the marble pavement, before granting the lives of a few remaining priests, and ordering one of the ulema to proclaim the word of God from the high altar. With that performative utterance the great church, “naked and desolate,” denuded of worshippers and treasures, was transformed into a mosque. Later that day, he made a tour of the old Sacred Palace; a studious and thoughtful Conqueror, Mehmet was heard to murmur lines from a Persian poet: “The spider weaves the curtains in the palace of the Caesars; the owl calls the watches in Afrasiab’s towers.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The French savant René Guerdan makes his mid-20th century account more suspenseful by supposing that the promised Venetian fleet was actually at anchor in Chios, awaiting a favorable wind, and was overlooked when a brigantine sent to search for it passed close by. “One windy day—on such things hang the fate of empires and the course of history.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But other scholars—unromantic, English— maintain that the armada sailed too late to change history; it made haste slowly, in the Roman way, awaiting developments in the Venetian, and carried an ambassador authorized to deal with the sultan just in case. Mortally wounded, Giustiniani reached Chios, an island with which his family had been so closely identified for the last century that all the boys born there were given their surname; he died after a few days, having outlived both the Empire and his heroic reputation, at least among Greeks. May 29, 1453, was a Tuesday, a day that Greeks still consider to be one of ill omen, unsuited for beginning a trip or launching an enterprise.</p>

<p>As commander, Mehmet had reserved for himself the surviving flowers of Byzantine nobility. After Giustiniani’s desertion Constantine, realizing the cause was hopeless, discarded his imperial regalia, and threw himself into the fray at the St. Romanus Gate, never to be seen again; at least not altogether. According to one story, a headless body was discovered underneath a pile of corpses, distinguished by calf-length buskins stamped with the imperial eagle. The Turks routinely decapitated their fallen foes, and, considering the honors they expected, it is not surprising that a pair of Turkish soldiers soon enough presented Mehmet with a head that some of Constantine’s surviving—and presumably terrified— courtiers opportunely identified as his. By one or another account, the last emperor’s remains were given a decent Christian burial, or his head was stuffed and sent on a gruesome tour of the Middle East. As for Mehmet’s treatment of the living, Runciman tells,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">He freed at once most of the noble ladies, giving many of them money so that they might redeem their families; but he retained the fairest of their young sons and daughters for his own seraglio. Many other youths were offered liberty and commissions in his army on condition that they renounce their religion. A few apostatized; but the greater part preferred to accept the penalties of loyalty to Christ.

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">The sultan was less lenient with the Italian and Catalan commanders who were trapped in the City: without ado they were executed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mehmet’s great catch was the grand duke himself, Lucas Notaras, who by now had ample opportunity to reconsider his quip about the cardinal’s hat vs. the sultan’s turban. Mehmet had treated the grand duke with elaborate courtesy, allowing him to return to his palace, and dangling the possibility of appointing him as the governor responsible for the Greek remnant in the City. That was until Mehmet, hearing that the grand duke’s sole surviving son, a fourteen-year-old, was a beauty, demanded him for his household. When the grand duke refused the eunuch who had been sent to fetch the boy, Mehmet ordered him, his son, and his luckless son-in-law who was paying a visit to be arrested and hustled to his presence. When Notaras remained unyielding, they were decapitated at the sultan’s banqueting table; in a last courtesy he granted the grand duke’s plea that the young men be killed before him, lest seeing him cut down shake their steadfastness. Almost immediately, Mehmet, leaving the desolate City for his capital at Edirne, disposed of what remained of the old power elite; “before his departure,” so Gibbon says, “the Hippodrome streamed with the blood of his noblest captives.” But were there so many left to slaughter? In a final dispersal, lots of four hundreds of nobly-born children and youths were shipped to the Muslim rulers of Granada, Tripoli, and Egypt.</p>

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">most men in Western Europe felt exceedingly gloomy about the future. Christian civilization appeared to be shrinking in area and dividing into hostile units as its sphere contracted. For over a century there had been no important advance in natural science, and registration in the universities dwindled as the instruction they offered became increasingly jejune and lifeless. Institutions were decaying, well-meaning people were growing cynical or desperate, and many intelligent men, for want of something better to do, were endeavoring to escape the present through studying the pagan past.<br>
Islam was now expanding at the expense of Christendom.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Morison’s readers in 1942—which he called “a day of tribulation for Europe and for America”—could hardly mistake the implied parallel with the Axis conquests since 1939, which, extending from the gates of Stalingrad to Malaya, reached their fullest extent in that year.</p>

<p class=""blockQuote"">To us the great fact of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is the expansion of Europe by the spectacular discovery of new continents; to contemporaries it was its diminution by the spectacular advance of the Turkish Empire. In France, between 1480 and 1609, twice as many books were published upon the Turks as upon America, and the greatest of the observers of Turkey, the Belgian Busbecq, complained that the nations of Christendom were gathering useless empires at the end of the world while losing the heart of Europe...</p>

<p class=""indented"">Trevor-Roper’s “A Case of Co-Existence: Christendom and the Turks” had a polemical edge. If Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries had learned to live with the Turks, couldn’t liberal Western democracy peacefully, if watchfully, co-exist with the Soviet bloc?</p>

<p>The Conqueror’s great-grandfather Murad I had institutionalized two practices which would define the emergent empire: the creation of a slave-soldier caste by the conscription of Christian boys, who, circumcised and converted to Islam, became the sultan’s Janissary corps, the foundation of his military machine; and the sanctioned execution by a new sultan of his brothers, uncles, and any other male relations who threatened to contest their supremacy. (Mehmet had his baby brother Ahmed strangled in a bath.) As Marc David Baer dispassionately observes, “Such an arrangement was little different from the internecine warfare to obtain the thrones of Western Europe at the same time, such as the Wars of the Roses in England. The difference with the Ottomans was that the bloodshed was systematized and legalized.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The difference seemed salient enough to the princes and prelates of the West, who might sometimes parlay with the Ottomans, but would never accept them as the legitimate heirs of Constantine (as the sultans insisted they were, by right of conquest). Within their ever vaster domain they exercised an absolute power over multitudes of subject races, not excluding the Turks themselves, a privileged but powerless caste: none of Western Europe’s absolute monarchs ever aspired even in theory to the absolutism that the sultans (or, in time, their viziers on their behalf ) exercised in fact. No wonder, as Trevor-Roper writes: “Throughout the sixteenth century Europeans were alternately fascinated and terrified by the Turks; by their silent, invincible, victorious armies, by their mixture of cruelty and toleration, their system of political slavery and their private moral virtues.”</p>

<p>In the long reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the sultan’s writ was extended from the Euphrates to the Nile to the verge of the Danube. His conquests in the Middle East, Mecca and Medina, Jerusalem and Egypt, made him the world spokesman and protector of Islam, succeeding the Abbasids. From the gates of Vienna, which he besieged, to the open Mediterranean, Suleiman’s great antagonist and Christian counterpart was the Habsburg emperor- king Charles V. The German popular historian Emil Ludwig draws a vivid sketch of their rivalry in <em>The Mediterranean: Saga of a Sea</em> (1942):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Both men were warriors—the Turk a conqueror, the Spanish rather a pretender to countries over which his dynasty had long quarreled with other dynasties. But Solyman needed war and would have died of boredom in his castle and harem. Charles could have lived without conquest.... If no one had rebelled against him he would merely have administered his inherited world empire. The Turk, on the contrary, wanted to win a world empire. Starting wars on the slightest pretext he took Rhodes, Bagdad [sic], and Belgrade, conquered Transylvania and Kurdistan. Charles, after deposing one Pope, picked another to perform his coronation, and this not even in Rome.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">Yes, but Suleiman, as the first sultan to assume the title of caliph, effectively was pope and emperor, like the fisherman’s wife in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. Charles thwarted Suleiman’s grand design to conquer Germany, just as Suleiman at a vast distance dealt Charles his worst defeat in the trenches of Tunis when he almost lost his life to the sultan’s pirate admiral, Barbarossa, thwarting his design to be lord of the ages, the greatest man of his time. “This,” says Emil Ludwig, “was something Charles had had every prospect of, because Cortez was then just conquering Mexico.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fernand Braudel, in his stupendous history, gives the back of his hand to the once fashionable thesis that it was the loss of the Levant to the Turks that turned the West westward, noting pointedly that “the Turkish occupation of Egypt in January, 1517 did not occur until twenty years after Vasco da Gama had sailed around the Cape of Good Hope.” Philip II inherited his father Charles’s dream of a “Universal Monarchy” under his Catholic majesty, but not the title of emperor, which passed to Charles’s brother Ferdinand upon his abdication. Philip’s conquest of the archipelago that became the Philippines and the peaceful annexation of Portugal and its overseas possessions combined in his person a world-straddling “Spanish dominion” on which the sun never set. It was the Ottoman sultans’ grand boast to be “Lords of the Horizon,” but it was the Habsburgs, with whom the Ottomans reluctantly conceded equality in a treaty of 1606, who commanded the farthest horizons.</p>

<p>The farthest flung of Spain’s claimed dominions in the New World was Alta California, at the northwest corner of the vast province of New Spain. Cortés, the conqueror of Tenochtitlan, led an expedition which “discovered” the Gulf of Mexico. The reconnoitering that followed led to nothing in the way of booty, plausible slaves, or settlement. For two centuries from the 1560s Spain’s Manila galleons sailed the long way, guided by the Japanese current, from Manila to Acapulco, Mexico, missing the Golden Gate (invisible in the summer fog).</p>

<p>Francis Drake, the English bravo despised as a privateer by the Spanish but lionized at home, anchored his 100-ton schooner, the Golden Hinde, for a month in June 1579, in Drake’s Bay, claiming the land as New Albion. Fanciful revisionists insist his landing was elsewhere, perhaps far to the north—but no one walking the Estero, wondering at the white cliffs so like Dover Beach, and admiring the bathers braving the surf, freezing even in summer, can doubt from the haunting atmosphere that this is where Drake and his crew spent their time—longer than would any Europeans in Alta California, for two centuries—and were waved good-bye when they departed by the bemused coastal Miwok, who were probably relieved to see them go.</p>

<p class=""indented"">In all of the part of North America now occupied by the United States—or so authority currently agrees—no place was more thickly settled than the California coast, or so peaceful. Certainly as compared to the feudal arrangements and tortuous ritualized warfare of the present northeast, as recently depicted in the Finnish scholar Pekka Hamalainen’s <em>Indigenous Continent: The Epic Contest for North America</em> (2020), and Bernard Bailyn’s <em>Barbarous Years: The Peopling of British North America: The Conflict of Civilizations</em> (2012).</p>

<p>“I am also always puzzled,” writes Czesław Miłosz, the Polish-American Nobel Prize-winning poet, who, for a long time while a professor at Berkeley, surveyed the scene from atop Grizzly Peak Boulevard—“I am also always puzzled why the white man steered clear of California for so long, though word of it had reached him through the accounts of sailors. But, after all, those were unfavorable reports: a foggy ocean, parched cliffs, impenetrable forests, thorny brushwood.”</p>

<p>In 1602 the tireless navigator Sebastián Vizcaíno sailed from Acapulco to wild Cape Mendocino. His journey retraced the epic voyaging of the conquistador Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542-43, who, proceeding north from La Navidad, managed to sail as far as Point Reyes before returning to the Santa Barbara Channel islands where he died. After Vizcaíno, so far as history records (the records were kept as state secrets by the English and the Spanish) there would be no European reconnoitering in California for 167 years. What was there to see, to do, to conquer, in this foggy, far-away, forlorn place, beyond the horizon? They let it be.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">Cedar Sigo lived in San Francisco from 1999 to 2016. During that time he wrote and published <em>Language Arts, Stranger in Town, Expensive Magic, Good Night Nurse,</em> his <em>Selected Writings</em> as well as many broadsides and collaborations. I met Cedar a year ago at a reading with Wave Books on Capitol Hill in Seattle. I had been reading his collection of lectures <em>Guard the Mysteries</em>. It became a life line, an infinity pool of inspiration, a family tree of poets to live with. “I hope that I can inspire young poets to hang in there when they feel ignored or are literally broke and hopeless,” Cedar said in an interview with Little Infinite. “I hope that I can be an example of a poet doing more than just writing in a corner in their notebook.” Cedar’s love for poetry is infectious. He allows it to take over. As he told me, sitting underneath the convex mirror at The Sorrento bar, “it’s time to get the show on the road.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cedar Sigo is a poet and member of the Suquamish Nation. He studied at The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute. He is the author of endless books and pamphlets of poetry, including <em>All This Time </em>(Wave Books, 2021), <em>Stranger in Town </em>(City Lights, 2010), <em>Expensive Magic </em>(House Press, 2008), two editions of <em>Selected Writings </em>(Ugly Duckling Presse, 2003 and 2005) and most recently <em>Siren of Atlantis </em>(Wave Books, 2025). In 2022 he received a grants to artists award from The Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He has taught all over the country including The University of Washington, Bard College, Washington University, Naropa University and The Institute of American Indian Arts. He lives in Lofall, Washington.</p>

<p class=""interviewer""><strong>DM:</strong> What is San Francisco to you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>CS:</strong> It was a place that I escaped to from Naropa. I left Naropa because I was restless. I just wanted to get on with sensation in my life. So I moved out there because I knew Kevin Killian and I knew Joanne Kyger.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">What do you remember of those first days in San Francisco?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just being broke and realizing that I came from a place where people were being paid to be interested in my poetry, but now people are like, “What? People still write poetry? What are you doing for a job?” I was working on Haight Street at Wasteland, this vintage store, at the time. I lived in the Tenderloin in a residential hotel. So first I figured out that really, nobody knows what I’m doing. Nobody cares that much about contemporary poetry, and I realized that my education was kind of a ruse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, what I loved was walking around the Tenderloin. I loved the grime on the chrome and the shine and the kind of abandonment and the sadness of it. And the way light would hit buildings. And I wanted to write that way. But I wasn’t good enough. So it was a lot of wandering, lots of talking about doing, talking about writing poems and talking a lot about books with other poets. A lot of talking about the poems I wanted to make for the first couple of years because I really didn’t or couldn’t yet.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Where were these conversations happening?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I used to go to that bar at 17th and Capp. Then I went to the Latin American Club a lot. I went to Doc’s Clock, sometimes The 500 Club, and a lot of skater bars in the Mission. A lot of time was spent in bars talking to other writers who just got off work or were just about to start work or after a reading. I always loved the idea that the history of art and literature—it’s made in these dark smoky rooms, it’s made in bars. It’s not made in your studio. It’s not made at your place of business, per se. Then it’s what you take away from that, and then how you go and make something.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Were there any other landmarks of your SF days?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New College of California, in the Mission, had a little bookstore called Blue Books. And they would do these really cool flyers that were kind of Joe Brainard-inspired and they had good readings. Some of the readers would be inspired by Joanne Kyger and others would be more inspired by the Language Poets. It was nice how they used the space. You’d get a pretty full picture of all the voices in the Bay Area, or people passing through. It was being used by Small Press Traffic, which is still around.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">For a time you were writing a blog for SFMoMA about art and events. Were you checking out certain galleries?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, Jack Hanley, Triple Base was one. Margaret Tedesco’s Second Floor Projects. Also the Luggage Store, all of David Wilson’s site specific celebrations. Jessica Silverman was amazing, 871 Fine Arts in the Geary building, which was a bookshop by Adrienne Fish and in the back she kept this sort of rotating gallery. They held a lot of West Coast painting and collage shows in the back. That was a much older clientele and artists than Adobe. And lots of house readings, and apartment galleries were being hosted in San Francisco during that time. It was fun. Alicia McCarthy is still my favorite painter.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Was there a certain approach to making a poem that resided in San Francisco?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They all definitely appreciated a touch and go approach toward composition. The ideas didn’t have to be fully developed before you moved on. You could adopt this skittering nervous measure easily in San Francisco. A lot of times people would be reading stuff that was really notes on trending literature (<em>Bartleby</em>, <em>Stanzas in Meditation</em>, Adorno). You were always thrown into this zone of questioning, Is that a poem or is that notes toward a poem?</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">San Francisco is known for the Beat scene and before that the Renaissance. What is the difference between these two scenes for you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Beats just let it all hang out, they wanted to be shocking. The San Francisco Renaissance poets, Duncan and Spicer, were more attuned to seeing how the syllables, the music of the poem, would open up to allow you to express your statement. While the Beats were just like, “We’re sick of waiting, let’s just say it.” They were conscious of articulation as well, but they came along almost ten years later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Is the “music of the poem” something that poets in San Francisco were specifically interested in developing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, in the sense that they often write without a subject, and they’ll go full bore, full steam ahead without a subject per se. So music is sometimes the only thing that’s forming, it’s your only grip onto the cliff they’re proposing.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Did you feel connected to the old guard of San Francisco? To the Beat scene, to the Renaissance scene?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt I was part of it because of Joanne Kyger, and because of Kevin Killian, who was writing the Jack Spicer biography at that time, and Peter Gizzi was kind of bringing out the whole Spicer trunk show then. I think in a certain sense, San Francisco has managed to keep that circle alive, the remains of a magic circle. And that has to do with poets crossing stylistic boundaries like Norma Cole, like Joanne Kyger, Philip Lamantia, Helen Adam. These are all poets with very distinct voices and ways of approaching poetry. Many very distinct styles, but they’re linked by these very magical figures, Robert Duncan and Jack Spicer.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You were kind of signed off by the old guard when City Lights published <em>Stranger in Town</em>. You wrote that while living there, right? How did that collection come about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was influenced by a lot of very crude animations I was seeing weekly at the Edinburgh Castle. David Enos, Sarah Enid Hagey, José Rodriguez—all these students from SFAI curated a film night and it was often shot on film, and sometimes they would be silent and very vivid, moving pictures, very poetic, for lack of a better word. I wrote poems being jealous of the vibrance of their imagery. I took risks and wrote with color—like old science films, Kodachrome, or the suffused color you find in experimental films. With that collection, I had for the first time a poem that was suitable to be the title poem. It was long. I published the poems first as a chapbook with my friend Micah Ballard, and we stapled it up the side and used cover art by Will Yackulic. I was exploring this whole other corridor of being a poet—not just the writing of poetry, but how to present it and share it. People were just hanging out, dropping by your house, and giving poems away.</p>

<p>26th and Bartlett, so between Mission and Valencia on 26th Street.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">The release reading for <em>Stranger in Town</em> was at City Lights. How did that go?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Will Alexander read with me because they couldn’t bring out Anselm Berrigan. Usually they would bring the poet that preceded you in the Spotlight series, but Anselm lived in New York. And then I read with Will again, because he was the next book too. So it was kind of this incredible golden handcuffs situation with Will Alexander. And what I remember is that the stairwell was so crowded with people sitting on the steps just to listen. I had been in the city for so long at that point and I had built up so much goodwill across many scenes.</p>

<div class=""blankSpace""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">The City Lights I know and the one you know are very different. What was it like when you first went there?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It used to be just that first tiny room where you enter and then the basement and they used to have mostly mimeograph magazines and things. Paperback literature. And then they just kept buying more and more of the building, as it became, post-Howl, a sort of literary institution. But I did a lot of my first readings there. And I remember it was always hot and crowded. It was kind of fun depending on if you got a seat. If you were ever caught standing at a City Lights reading that was murder. I mean, that was sometimes 55 minutes of standing. So it could be painful, like church.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">In some of our conversations you have talked about how poetry is such a smoke and mirrors game, how you have to fake it until you make it and then when you make it you still have to fake it a little bit. Is this something the older SF poets were feeling as well? How did Joanne Kyger and Diane di Prima make it all work?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The exact terrain may have been different for them. They each figured out an economy for themselves in which they could sort of survive. Diane did it through teaching, partly through Poets in the Schools for many years, which meant she had to be away from her family. Then they figured out they could just get local poets to come to some small town in Wyoming. They didn’t have to fly out professionals. She was also a founding member of the poetics program at Naropa, and taught at the now defunct New College of California. She went on to found a Magical School in the outer mission, teaching people about dimensions of healing and hidden elements of Western religions and how they became included within the occult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>And Joanne had purchased her house out in Bolinas before there were even septic tanks out there. In 1968. So, it was really cheap. She invented a certain kind of sustaining lifestyle out there, just over the bridge, so what I was getting from them was something else entirely. The message was that you need sustenance for yourself and your tribe and you need time for contemplation. How to take care of yourself between poems.</p>

<p>And we would smoke beforehand. I think she always wanted us to relax by knowing we could smoke before lunch. We didn’t have to wait until after we ate.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Joints? How was it prepared? Hand rolled? Did she use a grinder?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would trim it with these elegant little scissors that had a crane that you held. Then she would use a little joint rolling machine that had a red sheet and a bit of curvature and tension to it. If she didn’t feel like using the joint machine, she would ask her partner Donald Guravich to roll. He’s a writer and visual artist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a good friend. She had no reason as far as I could tell to trust that I would be good because I definitely wasn’t a good poet when we met. At that time my work was a lot of brittleness, trying to remember charmless catchphrases and just writing down things that make us petrified and stop us from being spontaneous.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">Did she ever give you specific prompts or homework? Or did she read your work and tell you what she thought? Would you show her your stuff?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would send me poems but I would never critique them. I didn’t even fully ‘get’ them yet. I always thought they were a little more casual than what I would do. But in fact, she just had a subtle ear. I couldn’t hear it. My ear wasn’t malleable enough. It wasn’t appreciated. Our works were different when she was alive. I think part of the reason we had such chemistry was because there was some antagonism. I was interested in some of the language poets because I was being force fed that at Naropa. But she would be looking retrospectively back at this ‘movement’ that I would be presenting like it was new. She was an interesting case, because at that point she had never had any books published by City Lights, so there was still new ground for her to break. <em>On Time</em> was finally published in 2015. That was her last full poetry collection.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How did you meet Diane di Prima?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Naropa when I was eighteen as a scholarship student. And as Naropa went on I would see Diane and Sheppard during the summers. Then in San Francisco I would go to all of her readings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">You penned and helped Diane with some of the last <em>Revolutionary Letters</em>. How did you end up at her bedside in her last days?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because she knew me as a groupie and fellow poet. I’d always sent her what I was doing—<em>Stranger in Town</em> (the stapled edition), <em>Expensive Magic</em>, reading flyers. I would send them in the mail with a little note, “Here, this is happening.” Then I would go to all her readings. That’s how we became friends. Then we read together when the <em>John Wieners Selected</em> came out from Wave Books. We read at City Lights together because she loved John Wieners too. Micah and I actually picked up this wooden chair and carried her down the stairs into the City Lights basement. She looked like Queen Victoria.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had been refusing to go on and I talked her down. I distracted her by asking about John. I tried to always have the right questions for her, and I think I did because I loved her work so much. I asked her, “Why didn’t you ever publish a book of John’s? If you loved his work so much, why isn’t there a John Wieners Poets Press book?” And she said, “He didn’t need a publisher, everybody loved his work, and he was having books out in Britain. And I was trying to publish people that needed publishers.” She mentioned Audre Lorde. Nobody else wanted to publish her at the time. Now everybody loves her. I just knew the right thing to ask her. And then I said, “We should go read together right now.” She read pieces from Nerves. It’s online.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">That was the beginning of your friendship?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, that was after years of attentive but nonirritating devotion. By the time we were hanging out, she kind of respected me. And she knew my writing voice. And then I went to write <em>Guard the Mysteries</em>, and she had (apparently) been wanting somebody to write an essay about her relationship with Lorde. When she caught wind of that she was really into it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">But how did the writing of the poems come about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was in San Francisco giving a lecture for <em>Guard the Mysteries</em>. I had contacted her and asked if I could interview her. She was in the hospital, the Jewish Home for the Aged in the Excelsior. The first day she canceled. I was horrified. I felt nervous to do it. Then she wanted me to bring her sushi and I was like, I can’t do that today if I’m not interviewing you. Then she rescheduled for the next day. After I sat down in her private room she immediately started taping us. She said, “I can sell this to a university.” She had a very scratchy voice. And she was so into me asking questions about her relationship with Audre Lorde. We had a good witty back and forth. She loved to make jokes and sign the books of hers I brought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After we finished the interview, I asked if she needed help with anything. She said, “Could you transcribe these poems?” She didn’t say <em>Revolutionary Letters</em>. She just said poems. She said, “They’re very short, and I have to memorize them and then I write them on this little tablet.” She gave me this shaky longhand writing in a tiny notebook. They had these three and four-line poems, and it was my job to get them into my phone. Then I would send them to her partner Sheppard. We read over them until they were just right. It was so natural. More like drawing together. She trusted me. It’s crazy that the most important work you do in your whole life could be drafting someone else’s poem. You can wander into the ending of a sixty year epic poem just by asking if you can help. The remains of a magic circle.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">We have talked a lot about Bob Kaufman in the past. He died before you moved to the city but I want to ask you how his works have affected you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bob Kaufman’s flow just takes poetry off the page. I got into mythologizing his life, his taking a vow of silence and being disobedient to the police and dealing with life in his own way. I can relate to him because I was one of the only Native writers in the Bay Area scene, and he was also so deep in bohemia and a person of color. I love that he is in the Mexico issue of <em>Semina</em> magazine. There is actual footage of Bob Kaufman in Ron Rice’s legendary underground film <em>The Flower Thief </em>(1960).</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">You never know where his line will turn. His poems have this kind of totemic energy because he has all these beautiful, glistening tasseled objects you can just attach in the air as he goes along, because his tongue is like liquid. No one else can do that in San Francisco. Bob Kaufman has come back to haunt everyone with his adornment. Those lines about the mirror in “Heavy Water Blues” are so sweet: “My mirror died, and can’t tell if I still reflect / I put my eyes on a diet, my tears are gaining too much weight.”</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">So surrealist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Totally surrealist. That’s why he was good friends with Philip Lamantia. Philip revered him. And he revered Philip. Will Alexander talks about hanging out with Philip and Bob in the early ‘80s and he wanted to talk to Bob so badly because he loved his work. But Bob was in his silent period. So he wouldn’t say much except he would make a gesture to give him a cigarette, or buy him a drink, but nothing much more than that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""blankSpace""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""interviewer""} -->
<p class=""interviewer"">I’m thinking about the way the poems of <em>Ancient Rain</em> were all found in his room at the Hotel Dante after it had burned down, and his friend went in there and found this leather folder with all these amazing poems, and he had just left them there, already moved on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which may be his best thing. In that he uses T.S. Eliot’s lines to create these huge Choruses. Like, in the poem “All Those Ships That Never Sailed”:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">All those flowers that you never grew–<br> 
that you wanted to grow<br>
The ones that were plowed under ground in the mud–<br>
Today I bring them back<br>
And let you grow them<br>
Forever.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""unindented""} -->
<p class=""unindented"">He uses that line to just slide in on his own voice. He’s not trying to disguise it, he’s trying to teach us to do that. When I do it, I might erase, so they would think I came in with my own brilliant line, but really, I’m coming in off these coattails. I like him aligning himself with someone like T.S. Eliot, because people don’t want to see that. It’s like aligning yourself with Melville. That’s who he needs to be in the arena with at that moment. Eliot is part of his Black imagination. And I am so interested in his imagination of these figures, Kaufman’s imagination of Apollinaire is so fascinating, or, how I’m not interested in Eliot, unless it’s Eliot’s music left wavering in Kaufman’s mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Bob’s adornment was always so beautiful, in his poems and his dress. He could pull off wearing something beaded. The same way he could pull off the level of refraction in his work, because he obviously is not earthbound. His imaginative life was more active than his reality. And I think that’s true for me. There is something about what I allow through from him, these colorful, vibrant, but symmetrical patterns, a certain kind of vibrance. I think I am learning how to show those edges. I think Jennifer Foerster does too, and Julian Talamantez Brolaski.</p>

<p><strong>At Stanford, everybody went Maoist in the fall of ‘68.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, everybody in Stanford SDS, which was my world. As the child of English left-wing parents, I had gravitated immediately to the “Students for a Democratic Society”—the vanguard of student radicalism—when I came to Stanford as a graduate student in 1966. I knew about SDS from my undergraduate career in the mid-60s at the London School of Economics, the hereditary institution of the London left. It was full of Americans taking a year in Swinging London and SDS had a presence. I liked the irony in their 1964 slogan—<em>Part of the Way with LBJ</em>. My first day I found the SDS recruiting table at registration and signed up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was supposed to be at Stanford for a PhD in Mathematical Statistics, under the influence of my father, who greatly admired a famous English statistician named Austen Bradford Hill, director of the first clinical trial for TB, of streptomycin. (George Orwell was put on streptomycin but couldn’t tolerate the drug.) I had no intention of becoming a statistician. I was trying to get away from my father and class-conscious England; as the child of a Jewish father and a mother of working- class origin in snobby British society, I never felt I was going to fit in. Not only that but they had sent me to a “Public School,” i.e. one of the ancient private schools that educate the English elite. It was the kind of school that caused a sharp intake of breath when someone found out you had gone there. At some level I figured I would have a better shot at breaking out of it all—out of the class system, “Public School,” bloody statistics, and the baleful influence of my father—in America. This turned out to be true. There was a lot of peer support for breaking out of the box in California. Pretty much everybody broke out of one box or another in California around 1968.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the Vietnam war, of course. Even in England we had demonstrated against the war, outside the giant, brutalist American Embassy building in Grosvenor Square. Actually I had been a teenage militant, painting “Yankee Go Home” on London walls. I was busted with Bertrand Russell (and about a hundred other people) for sitting down in Whitehall outside the Ministry of Defence and fined a ridiculously small two pounds. I was arrested again for invading the American air base at Ruislip. We climbed over the wire, went limp and got carted away, and were “bound over to keep the peace.” In other words, we were made to promise not to do it again. I suppressed all this during my application for a student visa to the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t know much about the US and I certainly didn’t know much about Stanford. I didn’t realize there was a difference in the US between public and private universities. I was astonished when I discovered the sun-drenched campus with its blond female undergraduates tooling around in Maseratis and its own golf course. Universities in England didn’t have their own golf courses. Stanford was still “The Farm” in 1966, just breaking into public view as the home campus of Silicon Valley. I went there because they gave me a scholarship (funded by the Office of Naval Research, a fact I suppressed in the anti-war movement) and because my aunt lived in Palo Alto. And anyway, California!—beaches, palm trees, the Mamas and the Papas, singing “California Dreamin’” as we crested the Sierra Nevada and came down into Auburn. Who wouldn’t want to be in California in 1966? I got there, signed up with SDS and was immediately put to work writing a leaflet explaining, in grinding detail, why the United States was wrong in Vietnam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My wife probably didn’t want to be in California; she was American but she preferred England. She went to work for the Welfare Department in San Jose and rapidly ran into trouble for wearing skirts so short they gave an occasional flash of underwear (Swinging London skirt length). Nor did she like the Marxist reading group we had started under the influence of a San Francisco State academic named Jim O’Connor who was running around the Bay Area setting up reading groups like a Marxist Johnny Appleseed. After an impossibly tedious Marxist remark from one reading group member she reared up and threw a cup of coffee at his head.</p>

<p>Being from an Old Left background myself, I started a union. We were American Federation of Teachers Local 1816, Stanford Employed Graduate Students, and our power bases were in the English and Poli-Sci departments. The university studiously ignored us till I managed to get strike sanction from the Santa Clara County Labor Council. What this meant, an old labor militant explained to me, was that the Teamsters would black the campus if we went on strike—there would be no deliveries. Stanford continued to regard us as ungrateful children, treating our perhaps rather naive negotiators with supercilious contempt. This wasn’t helpful but it did provide a genuine learning experience. “I was horrified,” one negotiator said. “I expected at least a mature attitude from the Administration.” But Stanford jacked up the salaries for TAs and RAs by a sizeable amount anyway, so I counted it as a victory. I wrote about all this in the <em>Stanford Daily</em>, indulging in a new-found desire to be a writer. Being from the cinéaste generation that grew up on Godard and Truffaut and <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em> I had previously wanted to be a film director. Everybody did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile LSD hit the campus. Wallace Stegner had brought Ken Kesey into the creative writing program and Kesey had been introduced to acid by Vic Lovell, an über-hip psychologist at the Menlo Park VA. (Kesey dedicated <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em> to “Vic Lovell, who told me there were no dragons and led me to their lair.”) Now Kesey and his pranksters were in La Honda in the hills above Stanford, blasted out of their minds and leading the youth of California astray. Or leading them towards enlightenment, depending on your point of view (Stegner hated Kesey). On the sunbaked campus even the occasional graduate statistician could be seen wandering around having visions. Others were getting their minds blown in encounter groups or in the psychodrama workshops of Husain Chung, a guru of the kamikaze school of psychotherapy. All these tendencies plus a few of Stegner’s western writers from the writing program coalesced in the Free University, the power center of high-end hippyism at Stanford and the opposite camp from us “radicals.” We thought they in the Free U were trivial hippies and they thought we were stuck-in-the-mud lefties. However, there was plenty of overlap on key topics such as getting loaded, protesting the Vietnam war, and music.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Grateful Dead were playing—my wife and I lived in what was allegedly a former Grateful Dead house in Palo Alto—and the music in the Bay Area was, let’s face it, better even than in Swinging London. We were at the great Human Be-In in January 1967 when Timothy Leary went public for the first time with “Turn on, tune in, drop out!” and the Hells Angels did the childcare. We drove up to the Fillmore in San Francisco to hear the Dead and in a moment of transcendence Bill Graham took my check for $2 and let me in. Soon it was the Summer of Love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t get me wrong, the Summer of Love was OK. Everybody did smile at each other for a while (even if most of them were stoned) and a lot of sex was had by those who, unlike me, weren’t married. Also rock and roll bands formed as if by spontaneous generation: at Stanford a bunch of students who couldn’t play a note disappeared into a house in the hills with plenty of drugs and musical instruments and reappeared as a fully-fledged, self-created band, the Anonymous Artists of America. Their music was... OK, I guess. Loud, at least. (Question: “What kind of music do you like to play?” Jerry Garcia: “I like to play <em>loud</em>.”)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a dark side, of course. My then brother-in-law, who was working for the Haight-Ashbury Switchboard, was walking down Haight Street one day, stoned on acid, and his soul came out of his mouth and bounced away down Haight Street and then a dog ate it. This caused him to have a psychotic break. He threatened to kill my sister-in-law and wound up in Napa State Hospital for a while. Meanwhile a friend of mine, a graduate student from the Statistics Department who had moved up to the Haight-Ashbury to be in the center of the historic doings, had taken to walking around Haight Street with a knife in his belt. This was the beginning of the collapse into speed that destroyed the hippie moment in San Francisco and scattered many into communes in the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Summer of Love was also Vietnam Summer. Johnson had been escalating the war, increasing US troop strength in Vietnam, and under the pressure to find new bodies he (or somebody) had made the mistake of cutting back on the student deferments that kept the campuses quiet. Respectable people, including my uncle in Palo Alto, campaigned for Eugene McCarthy for President, the first time a Democrat had run against an incumbent Democratic President (<em>End of the Way with LBJ</em>!). Meanwhile we in SDS burned draft cards. I didn’t have a card myself but I did get a draft notice at the end of 1967 (they drafted foreign students) and got out of it because my son had been born and I was classified 1-Y.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">On the Stanford campus the sharp end of the anti-war movement in 1967 was the Quakerish and high-minded Resistance, among them our Student Body President David Harris, who was jailed for fifteen months for refusing to go. But things turned violent in October with the huge Stop the Draft Week protests at the Oakland Induction Center, when some two thousand police and sheriff ’s deputies busted more than a hundred people, including Joan Baez and her mother. It was the beginning of the era of confrontation, “taking the war to the streets.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I myself was unable to attend the Induction Center riot because I was down in Santa Clara (there were still cherry orchards in Santa Clara) where my son was being born in the Kaiser Hospital. My wife had an impossibly long labor and I was in there doing Lamaze breathing with her for hours and hours (it didn’t help). She was very much on trend with Lamaze breathing, breastfeeding, and having me in the delivery room, although the head nurse was old school and disapproved visibly of dads at the birth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had an underground newspaper in Palo Alto run by graduate students, many of them from the Union and several of them future figures in the local revolutionary movement. Boringly named the <em>Midpeninsula Observer</em>, it was very political, too political, and a bit too heavy-footed for the underground press, which was rising up all around us and was mostly closer to the hippie end of things. We had exchanges with all the other underground papers. I still have a box in my basement filled with <em>Berkeley Barbs</em> and <em>LA Free Presses</em> and <em>East Village Others</em> and <em>Great Speckled Birds</em> and <em>Rats</em>. I know the <em>Black Panther</em> is in there too, the Panther paper out of Oakland and the voice of the other half of our political universe, the “Black Liberation Struggle.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <em>Midpeninsula Observer</em> (later, for some reason, the <em>Peninsula Observer</em>) was well edited thanks to a bunch of English Department graduate students and Marlene Charyn, a real editor who had been working for the Stanford Press and who taught me to edit. Eventually I fell in love with the charismatic Marlene—pale- skinned, dark-haired, Madonna-like but ex-Catholic. Somebody else taught me to do layout, waxing the text strips of the articles down on large, blue-lined layout sheets and filling the space between them with ripped-off graphics from the rest of the Underground Press (or anywhere else. It was like the Internet). Then we hauled the sheets to the one printer in San Francisco who would print radical publications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The underground press was free form, it was freewheeling and it was a free-for- all—Utopia! I wrote articles. I sold the damn thing on the streets of Palo Alto and eventually I got to take turns as editor-of-the-issue. I was amazed they let me do this. I put it down to my English accent: it makes Americans think you know what you’re doing. We whacked away at Stanford for its military connections, reported on the Black Panther Party and in 1967 we published the first feminist article anybody had ever seen around Stanford. It was by Melody Ermachild (she had changed her name from Melody Killian) and its directness and intransigence blew everybody’s mind. Marlene went off to cover the Huey Newton trial in Oakland (the leader of the Black Panther Party had been accused of killing a cop, which he quite likely did) and began a romance with the Panthers that ended up with a stretch as Eldridge Cleaver’s actual girlfriend. Cleaver came to speak at Stanford’s Memorial Auditorium some time around then and in the middle of a violent diatribe against the press he paused for breath and then remarked parenthetically “Except for miss Marlene Charyn of the <em>Peninsula Observer</em>.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, in an iconic moment two pissed-off adults, who hated either our politics or our general insouciance, barged through the <em>Observer</em> door one day while we were putting the paper to bed and demanded “Who’s in charge here?”</p>

<p>In February 1968 the Tet offensive in Vietnam made it clear that what we radicals were saying was actually true: A good chunk of the population of South Vietnam didn’t want either the US or the current military junta running the country. The North Vietnamese sacrificed much of the NLF, the southern guerilla force, in the offensive and the US military claimed a victory. But Tet shifted the balance of US public opinion against the war. For LBJ it was all downhill from there. For us radicals, we had the bit between our teeth. Then came the rest of 1968—Czechoslovakia, Paris, Columbia, <em>Berkeley</em>!—every campus in America seemed to be up in revolt. “Bliss was it in that sweet dawn to be alive,” as Wordsworth put it. Lyndon Johnson resigned as Democratic candidate in favor of Hubert Humphrey. We turned our backs on Humphrey and walked out on him when he came to Stanford to speak at Memorial Auditorium—he had sold out his liberal inheritance to support Johnson’s war. He blustered and huffed and completely lost his cool. He couldn’t imagine being insulted by students at <em>Stanford</em>. Amazingly there was considerable faculty support for the walkout.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The enormous riots after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. (a thousand buildings burned in Washington D.C. alone) seemed like they were taking us toward civil war. And then came Bobby Kennedy’s assassination and then Mayor Daley’s brutal police riot at the Democratic Convention in Chicago. By the fall of 1968 half of SDS had turned themselves into revolutionaries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Stanford Bruce Franklin, a young English professor and Melville expert, had come back from Paris a Maoist. Soon rumors floated around the campus about Bruce’s new organization, the Red Guard. It was by invitation only: those that knew, didn’t tell. It was all about Mao and the Cultural Revolution over there in China, of which we knew just about nothing. SDS luminaries began to disappear into the Red Guard, going silent when they entered. At our first Stanford sit-in, at the Old Union building, Bruce Franklin rose up at a huge meeting to debate tactics with Steve Weissman, a Free Speech movement veteran from Berkeley but clearly not a revolutionary. A <em>frisson</em> ran around the radical masses. Bruce! The revolution! The new thing!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I finally decided to punt statistics and enrolled in the only classes in my entire academic education that I actually took for pleasure: Film History and Karate (self-defense was part of the new revolutionary identity). But I couldn’t quite manage to get myself out of Stanford. My letters from the time are full of tedious whining about my indecision and cowardice. Then Stanford itself provided the route. The Student Health Service offered free counseling for those having Doubts and I lucked into a blond hippie-mama psychologist from the Free University who I had seen around campus with two beautiful blond kids hanging off her. She showed me the way. “Get up,” she said, and she waved me into a corner. Then she blockaded me in with her body, barring the way out with her arms, holding me in on both sides. “Get out!” she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was strong! I had to fight my way out. It was sexy, but it was enlightening—fight your way out!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did, eventually. But over the dramatic 1968-69 school year Bruce and the Red Guards metamorphosed into a more serious revolutionary formation, in alliance with Bob Avakian’s Revolutionary Union out of Berkeley (the real action always seemed to be up at Berkeley), and almost everybody I knew joined up. I didn’t. I grew up among disillusioned communists back in England and I didn’t believe in Stalin (Foundations of Leninism by J.V. Stalin was on the Revolutionary Union reading list). Nor did I believe the revolution was right around the corner. I got up at an SDS meeting, one of the last SDS meetings before the organization dissolved, and argued with Bruce that there were other models of socialism available. But it was useless, the membership had revolutionary stars in their eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a big and violent demonstration against the Stanford Research Institute, a para-Stanford think tank where military research was being done, the Revolutionary Union organized us into affinity groups, each one led by an RU cadre. My affinity group was the “Concerned Stalinists for Peace and Justice,” call sign “Stalinists! Stalinists!” showing that a sense of humor persisted among the campus Maoists (but not for long). There was also the “William P. Hewlett Fragmentation Bomb Brigade,” after the famous trustee and founder of Hewlett-Packard, call sign “Hewletts! Hewletts!” but that’s all that I can remember. We threw rocks through the SRI windows and set barricades on fire. The police arrived and drove us away with tear gas, and the enduring memory I have of that event is of my wife legging it away from the tear gas while pushing a stroller with our year-old son in it. During all of this the Young Americans for Freedom, the student right-wingers, took photographs of us for police purposes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up at Berkeley the People’s Park riots were happening, with the Alameda County sheriff’s deputies managing to kill one man (James Rector) and blind another (Allan Blanchard) with shotguns. Governor Reagan called in the National Guard and the campus was flooded with tear gas. Nobody had ever seen anything like it: it felt like war. We from Stanford went up to Berkeley for the big and (maybe) peaceful march to People’s Park a couple of days later, wearing our US army plastic helmet liners, proof against police batons, and damp bandannas against tear gas. The sheriff ’s deputies were up on the roofs, carrying automatic weapons this time, but nobody got killed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was not simple. I found myself half wanting to be a revolutionary and half thinking the whole thing was absurd. All my friends were joining up and soon moving off into collectives in Redwood City and San Jose to organize the working class. At the Observer we had an interminable series of meetings about whether we should become a revolutionary collective or what, complete with long manifestos in purple ink from the same mimeograph machine in the English Department we used for Union propaganda. We even called in Vic Lovell, the same Vic Lovell who was now a luminary in the Free University, to run a group for us to figure out what we should be doing. All I can remember is that in one session he had us jumping up and down like chimpanzees and yelping. Marlene, having joined up, was the voice of the revolutionary faction in the paper and had us reading Mao—“Combat Liberalism,” “Writings from the Yenan Forum on Art and Literature,” and “Where do Correct Ideas Come From?” (In case you don’t remember, they come “from social practice, and it alone.”) Marlene was right, Mao was right, we were a bunch of liberals and we were clearly not serious: if you stayed around Stanford you were going to have to join up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stayed at Stanford long enough for the big sit-in at the Applied Electronics Laboratory that gave the Stanford student radicals their name (the “April Third Movement”). It ruined the career of Stanford president Kenneth Pitzer, who was finally forced to resign. I felt slightly sorry for Pitzer for many years, until I found out he was one of the scientists who testified against Robert Oppenheimer in 1954 in the hearing that destroyed Oppenheimer’s career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Revolutionary Union recruited me hard because I was leadership material (the Union). One recruiting effort took place at the Stanford baseball diamond, where the former leader of the Concerned Stalinists affinity group, who had beaten the draft by putting albumen in his urine, outlined the Principles of Unity of the Revolutionary Union. These were “Democratic Centralism,” “Armed Struggle,” and “Dictatorship of the Proletariat.” You had to believe in these, and also, officially at least, you had to believe in the leadership of Enver Hoxa, Mao’s Albanian ally and close comrade in arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” the recruiter told me. Evidently even the RU couldn’t swallow Enver Hoxa. I, having grown up among disillusioned Stalinists, didn’t believe in any of this but the moral pressure was intense. They were committed, they were organized, they were working to smash capitalism, what’s your problem, comrade? All my friends joined up. Guilt-ridden but liberated, I dropped (formally, finally) out of Stanford and moved up to San Francisco to work for the second-best underground newspaper in the city (<em>Dock of the Bay</em>, it was called, after the Otis Redding song). But really I moved up to get away from it all. No more Maoists! No more statistics! Free at last, great God almighty, free at last!</p>

<p><strong>Unscheduled interactions between wildlife and humans</strong> have become more common, and for all we celebrate the resurgence of endangered and exotic species, these meetings can be a tad ambivalent. I am here today only because the coyote that darted across Highway I-5 in full traffic some years ago in San Diego missed my front fender by a split-second.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long ago, rounding a bend on a cliff trail in the uplands of the island of Maui, I was charged by a wild pig (both of us equally terrified, resolved by his plunging off the trail). The snapping jaws of a moray eel lunging out of a coral crevice off Waikiki beach narrowly missed my arm. A highly intelligent shark cut a researcher and me off from shore in the shallows of a lagoon on the Great Barrier Reef (resolved by taking our hammers out of our packs and plunging boldly forward).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meeting wildlife in the wild, where you expect to see them, is scary. But what about closer to home? What about where you don’t expect to see them?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What about my Swedish colleague and his fiancée, treed by a herd of angry elk while innocently picnicking in a meadow just outside of Stockholm? Or the mother of a Brazilian friend scattering flour on the porch of their Rio de Janeiro house near a forest only to find it covered with a latticework of panther tracks in the morning? Or the hunt for a sixteen-foot ball python, progeny of a legion of escaped domestic pets, suspected of devouring a spate of missing cats in Naples, Florida?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A very long time ago, before pythons were part of that landscape, I lived with my family on a Florida Panhandle bayou 50 miles from the Okefenokee swamp, where poisonous snakes of every variety known to North America abounded, plus the deadly coral snake as a bonus. So did crocodiles and alligators. Skipping over the numerous reptile encounters that triggered my childhood post-traumatic stress syndrome, I’ll mention only that many years later I read of a jumble of faint GPS signals that led hunters to a very old, very big alligator deep in the Okefenokee. In that alligator’s gut, once he was dispatched? The undigested tracking collars of a dozen or more hunting dogs. Distinctive smirk of the family <em>Alligatoridae</em> still frozen on his big dead jaws in the news photo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As climate change and conservation continue to alter animal habitat, critters once hunted down and slaughtered are finding their way back into the human habitat. We are thankful for their return, but they are not always as grateful for the shelter afforded them by the endangered species laws. Because some of them still do their thing. That predator thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the plus side, while they boldly show up at night, they do so less in the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My friend the history professor walks into his house in California’s Central</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Valley carrying a big bag of kitty litter in his arms. Stretched out full length on the floor three feet away from the front door? A very big snake with a diamond-patterned hide. Frightened out of his wits, the professor hurls the kitty litter at the snake. The plastic covering breaks on impact, burying it under a great beige mound of imitation sand. One heartbeat later, the mound erupts. A large reptilian head rears up, fangs out, jaws gaping, hissing in fury and ready to strike. Professor flees to the street. Animal Control crew dispatched from his cell phone terminate the creature in the backyard and carry off its corpse in a capacious zip-up black bag with the gnomic parting comment: “That was a serious health threat.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big rattler, it seemed, had crawled in through a ventilation shaft seeking mice to feed on. Where my friend’s cat was all this time I have no idea. Prudently cooling her heels at the neighbor’s house, one suspects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My grandmother liked to tell the story of her father as a boy in mid-1800s Petaluma, California, playing with a little brown dog in the yard. He and his sister were teasing it with switches until their mother came out and screamed. The dog was a bear cub. (Later in his life, in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, my great-grandfather had to shoot my grandmother’s own little dog when a rabies epidemic broke out among the wild animals of the county.)</p>

<p>For over a century bears were gone from settled California. Now their scat’s been spotted in suburban Marin County across the Golden Gate from San Francisco. Down in southern California, as befits the culture, the bears are bolder. They strip avocado trees of their fruit (a particular favorite), pick off the odd small domestic pet, and brazenly chill in backyard swimming pools when the temperature climbs too high, as it often does now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In San Francisco a peregrine falcon nests near Market Street, preying on urban rats. A coyote forages on Telegraph Hill. Coyotes stalk unleashed dogs in Stern Grove, famous for its free Bach concerts in the summer. The Project Coyote organization teaches dog owners how to communicate like a predator to establish dominance over the interlopers. Participants learn to use loud voices, wave umbrellas, and shake rocks in Red Bull cans. Across the bay a fox stretches out at noontime on a warm Berkeley driveway.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before mountain bikers took over Marin County, I loved walking up East Blythedale canyon through fragrant stands of redwood, eucalyptus, and bay laurel to the eastern ridge of Mount Tamalpais. One day, on the narrow footpath winding up the side of the dark, damp canyon full of fine old houses, I ran straight into a large, lean dog with a long snout and a silver-furred face—</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it wasn’t a dog. It was a <em>wolf</em>. A wolf two feet away staring at me with its wild yellow eyes. His putative owner (or I should say, companion human), a slender man with matching silver hair clasped in a ponytail, followed close behind. My heart pounded long after they disappeared around the next bend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Long ago, camping up north in the rugged Trinity Alps, I heard a mountain lion in the night. Its cry was soft and high, like a baby’s. A wilderness cry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mountain lions are all around us now. A woman in Mendocino County reports looking up from her desk to see a big cougar staring soulfully back through the window. In Marin they stroll down the main streets of the little towns in broad daylight. Sometimes they attack people on trails, but so far never in Marin or in the hills above Berkeley, the city in the East Bay where I live now. In the early hours of the morning, however, mountain lions have been spotted haunting the dumpsters behind the fashionable restaurants downtown.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In those same Berkeley hills that same history professor, relocated from the Central Valley, comes home from the movies late one night with his partner to find a herd of deer stampeding through the front yard. Almost, the men joke, as if something was chasing them. Seconds later a large mountain lion thunders past, muscles taut and straining under the tan fur, so caught up in the fury of the chase he doesn’t notice the two humans standing a scant four feet away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Vanishes with the deer into the night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At my house in the Berkeley flatlands I store cat chow in a green plastic garbage can in the driveway. One evening high-pitched chattering comes through the bedroom window, followed by a loud thump. Get up, go out. Garbage can tipped over, bungee cord securing the lid unstrapped, vitamin-enriched high protein grain- free kibble spilled out all over the concrete—and four or five raccoons are feeding on it. When I shout, they split like lightning. I right the garbage can, refasten the lid. Check the bungee cord a couple of times. Leave next morning on a three-day trip.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Evening after my return, more chattering in the driveway. Get up, go out. There they are ranged around the can again, but this time it’s still upright, lid strapped tight. The raccoons scatter when I shout, though not as quickly as before and not nearly as far away as I would wish. In fact, they don’t actually split. They loiter a few feet away under the fluted pink and maroon blossoms of a fuschia bush.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now raccoons can be nasty; they will kill cats and small dogs with their sharp claws if provoked—or if an unwise and sentimental human feeds, and then fails to feed them. Under their watchful eyes I undo the cord. Lift up the lid to reposition it. Then scream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Large raccoon curled up, fetal position, on top of the kibble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I leap back. In my haste, knock over the can.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Disoriented, dehydrated, but undeniably well fed after three days trapped inside, the raccoon surfs a cresting wave of chow onto the driveway. Stumbles to her feet. Spots her rescue team waiting in the shadows under the fuschia bush. Staggers off in their direction. Vanishes with them into the night. That is to say, splits.</p>

3678,"Dream Tonight of Peacock Tails","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>When the peacocks arrived in San Francisco</strong>, I didn’t think too much of it, but Alyona, my yoga teacher, was not happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ll take the park,” she said. She said these words in a whisper as she looked up at the houses on Telegraph Hill, where the birds had been sighted earlier in the week. “I’ve seen it happen. In Pasadena.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two weeks after they touched down on Telegraph Hill, the peacocks migrated to Washington Square Park. We found them behind the statue of Benjamin Franklin, in the grassy oasis where Alyona had led our weekly Saturday morning yoga class for the past fifteen years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“They’ve taken our grassy oasis,” she said, nodding her head slowly. I’ve known Alyona for a long time. We are good friends and I have a good grip on the meaning of her nods. When she nods her head slowly, in deep focus, she is generally thinking about Franco, her ex-husband.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Why do you think they’re <em>here</em>, in our grassy oasis?” I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“My question <em>exactly</em>,” she said, nodding her head, narrowing her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That morning, we had to lay our mats in the not-so-grassy oasis on the other side of Benjamin Franklin, away from the peacocks, who seemed so content, so at ease pecking at the worms in the soft, lush grass where we used to do our downward dogs. We would have liked to put more distance between us and the birds. But Washington Square Park is a small park in the middle of the city, and there’s only so far you can move before you’re on the footpath and the surrounding streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That first Saturday with the peacocks was not disheartening, but it was trying. Ten minutes into class, just when we were starting our cat-cow stretches, five or six of the smaller birds had the idea to peck at the worms in the grass between our mats. Luckily, they took care not to brush us with their feathers, and a kind of peaceful tolerance, built on mutual goodwill, formed between us and them; ultimately, we found the birds distracting, but not to the point that we couldn’t complete our cat-cows. The rest of the class proceeded in peace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was not the case the following Saturday. My close friend, Natasha, was emerging from a long, searching corpse pose when a large peacock landed on her chest and started pecking at her face. Now, I happened to know that Natasha had been using some kind of salmon sperm extract to fight the crows feet under her eyes, and I reasoned that the peacock had got a whiff of the stuff—but that was beside the point: the bird should not have been in San Francisco, and certainly not on her chest, and I had to cut my own corpse pose short to shoo the bird away and save dear Natasha’s face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Alyona’s point of view, this was, in effect, a declaration of war. “This is <em>our </em>grassy oasis,” she said at the end of the class, nodding slowly, seated on her mat, cradling Natasha’s upper body in her arms. “We cannot be intimidated. We cannot make any more concessions to these monsters.” Natasha, bless her—she was dabbing the deep gash in her left cheek with Alyona’s t-shirt—objected to the characterization of the peacocks as “monsters,” and wondered if Alyona might consider thinking of them as “observers.” She said “observers” gently, with the innocence of a child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” said our teacher, brushing Natasha’s hair out of her eyes. “They are monsters.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just then, as if to prove her point, a pride of peacocks started shrieking. It was a dreadful shriek. High pitched. Loud. Acute. “See?” Alyona said, seizing the moment with confidence. “Tell me they don’t sound like babies being tortured through a microphone.” That was, I think, a bit much, but it was true that the sounds the birds were making suggested they were suffering some kind of painful, matrimonial injustice. In fact, it was mating season, and the males were warming up their voices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the time July rolled around, the peahens had arrived in Washington Square Park, and this meant we had to wait for them to be seduced by<br>the peacocks every Saturday morning before we could lay our mats on<br>the grass. So natural, so effusive, so assured were the birds in their mating movements through the park—they even made inquiries at the Italian restaurants on neighboring Stockton Street—that anyone visiting the area for the first time could be forgiven for thinking the birds had been there forever. When the peacocks danced and spread their feathers in front of the peahens, the tourists took photos and said things like, “In San Francisco the peacocks are very pretty. Aren’t they pretty?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it became clear that the peacock population would need to be controlled, the Mayor of San Francisco hired a peacock re-locator. Jerry Garcia, for that was his name, visited the park twice a week. His method was simple: he threw handfuls of lightly salted peanuts around the statue of Benjamin Franklin and, while a bird was eating, he would sneak up on it, clutch it, and put it in a cage. He put the cage in his truck and drove away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Where do you take the birds,” I asked Jerry Garcia one day when he visited our class. Citing the difficulty of self-realizing in the company of peafowl, some of our most talented yogis had stopped attending Alyona’s class, and the City of San Francisco sent Jerry Garcia to assure us that they were doing everything they could to protect the program.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I take the peacocks to a new home,” Jerry Garcia told me. “A safe rural environment, far away from here.” When he said that, I pictured him driving the peacocks out to Inverness, where he would plop them in the sprawling meadows to graze, carefree, among the lambs and cows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to re-locating the peacocks, Jerry Garcia installed motion sensor sprinklers behind the statue of Benjamin Franklin in the hope<br>that the bursts of water would repel the birds from our area. When this failed, he put statues of large orange cats in the park, for it was hoped that having “predators” around would fray the birds’ nerves. Still, the birds kept arriving, and our yoga class dwindled to four: Alyona, Natasha, Mathilde, and me. It got to the point where we had to ask ourselves if the peacocks, so beautiful when they spread their feathers and paraded in front of the peahens, were not some kind of cosmic sign: Perhaps we should give up yoga and spend our Saturdays doing something else, like knitting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” Alyona said when I voiced the idea after a particularly grueling class. That morning, a man walking his poodle had thrown a ball in the opposite direction of a harem of peahens, but the ball had hit a bench and bounced into Alyona’s back while she was correcting my cow face. Alyona had shrieked, stood up, and looked poised to chase the man into the harem, but she took three deep breaths and sang a couple of mantras. The whole thing was very trying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“No,” Alyona said again, nodding slowly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“But we can’t go on like this,” I said. I pointed to Natasha, who had stopped using the salmon sperm extract on her face, and now looked considerably older. I pointed to Mathilde, the other hanger-on, who, like me, looked very solemn, most likely because we could not understand the forces leading to this moment in our lives. If anything, our resistance—our unwillingness to back down and cede the park to the birds—had made us wiser, stronger.</p>

<p>One day, when the peacocks offered us fifteen minutes behind<br>the statue of Benjamin Franklin, the Mayor of San Francisco made an appearance. Dodging a couple of peahens, the Mayor walked over to where the four of us were standing in mountain pose behind the former president. He, too, entered mountain pose, from which he addressed us a little nervously, but not uncheerfully. “I remember when I burned TVs in this park,” he said. “For fun.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around us, the peacocks had started shrieking again, and I found it difficult to hear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“For your mom?” I said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We were tired of sitcoms,” said the Mayor, whose words seemed to be emerging from some unguarded territory within him. “We couldn’t watch sitcoms anymore so we put our TVs in the park and we burned them. We must have burned twenty TVs. Maybe more.” As he said these words, he began to puff out his chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Keep your belly soft,” I said. “Engage your core.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Mayor took a deep breath and puffed out his chest a bit more. Looking at him from the corner of my eyes, I could see his nipples under his shirt. They were hard and firm, like towel hooks poking out to the world. He was not keeping his lower belly soft. Nor was he engaging his core.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I was in a film once, you know,” he said. “I played a warrior for the League of Shadows in <em>Batman Begins</em>. To prepare for the part, I was asked to go to the gym and work on my chest for five hours a day. I needed to have a tremendous chest to be a warrior for the League of Shadows. The casting agent said, ‘No one in the League of Shadows will take you seriously if you don’t have a tremendous chest, and if the League doesn’t take you seriously, why would anyone watching take you seriously?’ It was good advice,” said the Mayor. “Don’t you think it was good advice?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After he said these words, the Mayor walked to the statue of Benjamin Franklin, where a lone peacock had posted up on the president’s shoulder. The Mayor stared at the peacock on the president’s shoulder. The Mayor puffed out his chest and pointed a finger at the bird. The bird and the Mayor looked at each other, holding out, neither one willing to look away. They were still looking at each other when we emerged from mountain pose, rolled up our mats, and went home. “I’m the Mayor of San Francisco,” I heard the Mayor saying as we walked away. “That’s right,” he said, “the Mayor.”</p>

3686,"California: The Great Subculture","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>California is too big—and too big a subject</strong>—for me to approach in any but the most tangential, personal way, focusing on what’s familiar to me, the work that artists and writers do. I went to junior high and high school in Palo Alto and left in the fall of 1968 for Columbia College and New York City, where I’d been born in 1951 and have now lived for more than fifty years. I know California only from my adolescent years and later visits of days, weeks, sometimes months. I’m a New Yorker. I assume that no other American city is anywhere near as significant as New York when it comes to the arts. But I also believe that just about anybody who makes a meaningful contribution to the arts is an outsider of one kind or another. California produces an interesting type of outsider, because unlike New York’s outsiders, who view the outside from the inside, the Californians know the inside from the outside. So when I borrow a phrase from the poet Gary Snyder, “the Great Subculture,” I do so in the belief that subcultures can be great cultures. Maybe all great culture is subculture, in the sense that a rejection of academic values and ideas is involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For readers familiar with Snyder’s <em>Earth House Hold</em>, where the phrase “the Great Subculture” appears in the essay “Why Tribe,” I’ll add that I’m not especially interested in the communal and spiritual ambitions that Snyder had in mind in the 1960s. Frankly, Snyder’s “Why Tribe” strikes me as a period piece, with little of the elegance that you find elsewhere in <em>Earth House Hold</em>, in the colloquial austerity of travel writings including “Lookout’s Journal.” What interests me about the idea of the Great Subculture—I like the old-fashioned, rather Victorian capitalization—is the dissent from official culture, a vigorously arrogant marginality that I think shaped the best of creative and intellectual life in California for much of the 20th century. Listen to what Snyder has to say: “We need not look to a model or rule imposed from outside in searching for the center.” This exactingly informal poet isn’t arguing that there aren’t models or rules, but that people must find them for themselves—their own models, rules, center.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This idea of a Great Subculture, it seems to me, links much of the best of artistic and intellectual life in California: the dazzle of the great Hollywood comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, including Cary Grant’s verbal fireworks with Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn; the labyrinthine thinking in Robert Duncan’s unfinished and unfinishable <em>H.D. Book</em>; the paintings and collages of the artist who went by his first name, Jess, and, along with New York’s Joseph Cornell, turned European Surrealism into American Phantasmagoria; Richard Diebenkorn’s early drawings, etchings, and paintings of Northern California, among them a few imperishable images of bourgeois bohemia; the music that Joni Mitchell made in Laurel Canyon; M.F.K. Fisher’s memoiristic writings about food; Edmund Teske’s overlapping, multiplying photographic images; Frederick Crews’s withering attacks on Freud. The seriousness of culture in California has always involved finding your own center. For Snyder the Great Subculture embraced “Paleo-Siberian Shamanism and Magdalenian cave-painting; through megaliths and Mysteries, astronomers, ritualists, alchemists and Albigensians; gnostics and vagantes, right down to Golden Gate Park.” There’s a touch of madness in the best of California. It’s there in Hollywood, a wild enterprise from start to finish. But there’s also something to be said for the outrageousness of San Francisco’s Barbary Coast as part of this cultural and intellectual ambience, a piratical spirit of comic plunder and pigheaded extremism.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">What I’m offering is impressionistic. That’s true of any attempt to describe something like the spirit of place. I’ve found myself turning back to the extraordinary histories of American literature that Van Wyck Brooks published several generations ago; their eclipse is undeserved. Brooks brought a kind of genius to evocations of literary experience in New York, Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco. He knew how to slip in wonderful asides. While writing about Frank Norris and San Francisco in <em>The Confident Years (1885-1915)</em> he regrets that Norris “had not been able to tell the real story of a real Bret Harte heroine who lived in San Francisco.” This is the dancer Isadora Duncan, another member of the Great Subculture, who was born in San Francisco in 1877. Brooks writes that Duncan “was touring California, at twelve, with her brothers and her sister, dancing and reciting in the little towns.” He pushes farther:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">Feeling she was Whitman’s spiritual offspring, she dreamed of a dance that would be worthy of him,—‘the ideal figure of youthful America dancing over the top of the Rockies,’—a system of dancing without a system, following her fantasy, composing her motions all as it were on the wing. The gypsy band of the Duncans and their mother were soon to embark for New York [and] then she was to set out for Europe.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">The Great Subculture, as I conceive it, is integral—maybe even essential—to the culture of modernism. California is a part of the story, a region where artists and writers were free of the imperiousness of New York and the sometimes stultifying assumption that you’re at the center of things. Of course there are inhibitions that come with any place you happen to find yourself; regional history can be both a blessing and a curse. New England shaped the poetry of Frost and the early Robert Lowell. The South shaped the novels of Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, and Eudora Welty. Californians have plenty of history to contend with, but it’s so deep and diverse—the Spaniards, the Native Americans, the Gold Rush, the Gilded Age—that there may be more opportunities to pick and choose than in New England or the South. Who is a Californian, anyway? When I lived there in the 1960s there seemed to be no question that transplants outnumbered natives, but that may have reflected the particular community in which I was growing up, an academic community where people were always on the move when it came to jobs and advancement. But even old California families can be relatively new, at least compared to the deep family roots in other parts of the country. So the arts in California inevitably include recent arrivals and maybe even people who are just visiting. Perhaps it isn’t pure happenstance that Allen Ginsberg, an East Coast Jew, had his first public reading of “Howl” in San Francisco. Frank Lloyd Wright, a Midwesterner, developed a whole new style when he worked in Southern California.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If California liberated creative spirits from across the country and well beyond—surely that’s part of the story of Hollywood—Californians and their doings have also had an impact well beyond the state’s borders. There’s a vagabond aspect to culture in California—maybe a modern version of the medieval troubadours—so that certain developments in mid-20th-century San Francisco seem more closely related to developments in New York, Asheville, and Majorca than to what was going on in, say, Los Angeles. It was Isadora Duncan, a San Francisco renegade, who produced shock waves in Europe, where she helped shape modern dance and some developments in classical ballet. Another Bay Area native, Gertrude Stein, reimagined American prose from her apartment at 27 rue de Fleurus in Paris, a writer so determined to recenter the literary center that many felt she couldn’t see anything beyond herself. At least so far as Stein was concerned, she was the center—and James Joyce be damned. Who can doubt that she and her brother Leo, on their first visits to Picasso’s studio in Montmartre, were still kids from Oakland?—provincial sophisticates, much like the young Picasso.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Which is only to say that one need not remain in California to embody California’s Great Subculture. Pauline Kael, although she spent most of her career at <em>The New Yorker</em>, was born in California, lived and worked in the Bay Area into her forties, and is, by my reckoning, the most Californian of American critics. That independent voice of hers comes from way out West. In the introduction she wrote for the omnibus collection published toward the end of her life, Kael had this to say about her early years: “Writing from the San Francisco area, publishing in a batch of mostly obscure ‘little’ magazines, reviewing on KPFA in Berkeley, and then, in 1965, bringing out <em>I Lost it at the Movies</em>, I razzed the East Coast critics and their cultural domination of the country. (We in the West received the movies encumbered with stern punditry.)” That stern punditry was the official culture talking. As for Kael’s contribution to the Great Subculture, she admitted that people who didn’t like her writing weren’t entirely mistaken when they found it both “Olympian and smart-alecky”—an alliance of opposites that’s an element of what’s best about the culture of California. In her later years Kael lived in Great Barrington, a Massachusetts town with some of the bohemian nonchalance of Berkeley, where she’d begun.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">I’ve kept these remarks in the past tense. The new century is still new. I can’t say what it will mean for artists and writers and cultural life in California—or for that matter anywhere else. The answer involves a more general question about culture and globalism, and globalism, whatever its value, encourages a dangerous homogenization. I believe that all culture that matters is particular. Even the greatest masterworks—Shakespeare’s plays, Mozart’s operas—are universal in part because they’re specific. Years ago I had lunch with Jess in the Victorian house in San Francisco he’d shared for decades with Robert Duncan. I asked him about the light bulbs in the fixture hanging over the table where we were eating in the kitchen, which had curiously shaped filaments. Jess told me that decades earlier he and Duncan had salvaged these old light bulbs from abandoned buildings in San Francisco, fascinated by their curious, antiquated designs. The work that Jess and Duncan were producing in the decades after World War II came out of a San Francisco that in the age of the internet can seem as unrecognizable as those funky old light bulbs that were still miraculously illuminating Jess’s kitchen table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve more and more come to believe that all culture that’s authentic and important somehow floats free, less encumbered by time and place than the Marxists, sociologists, and sociologizing critics and historians would have us believe. To be of a place but out-of-place is the great challenge. California’s artists and writers have known a thing or two about that. Some of the best of them, speaking with local accents, celebrating local obsessions, have found their work embraced around the country and the world.</p>

3695,"Judithe Hernández","<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""openingParagraph"">Judithe Hernández’s studio is on the second floor of the Arroyo Seco Bank Building, a landmarked Beaux Arts commercial two-story at the corner of North Figueroa and York in LA’s Highland Park neighborhood. Inside, the units are tucked away behind frosted glass doors, and with the sound of my footsteps echoing down the hall, I feel like I’m walking into a hard-boiled novel. But once invited into her studio, I’m treated to the industrial, clean lines of metal cabinets, desks, and canvases that meld with the colors of decorative items like Mexican masks, plates, and framed reproductions of Lotería cards. It is bright and airy, filled with reds, yellows, and whites.<br>
<br>
Born and bred in Los Angeles, Hernández launched her art career as the lone female member of “Los Four,” the seminal artist collective that was instrumental in bringing attention to the Chicano Art movement of the 1970s through a striking array of paintings, murals, and sculptures. Her masterful pastels depict surreal scenes of the archetypal Mesoamerican female that are often haunting, often sensual, and always emotionally captivating. Her works display an elegance of line and composition that harkens back to masters ranging from Mexico’s famed “Big Three” to the Pre-Raphaelites.<br>
<br>
Hernández is welcoming and unguarded. “Have you had the Mexican soda Penafiel?” I opt for a lemon-lime. We sit down on a red couch as she shuts the television off. She is an easy-going, gracious conversationalist, and Michelangelo, George Kubler, and the odd, choice expletive can blend seamlessly in conversation, making for an experience like chatting with your cool aunt who did all the things your parents didn’t but still made it to all the important family events.<br>
<br>
After a conversation during which I learn details about her activism-filled ‘70s, her creative process, and uncover the mystery behind why, at the height of a continued upward trajectory between 1970 and 1983, she left it all for a 26-year stint in Chicago when she made no art, Hernández says, “It’s customary in any Latino household to have your guest part with a gift.” She hands me a small glassine bag. “This is for you.” This interview has been edited for style and clarity.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Judithe Hernández first won acclaim in the 1970s as a member of the celebrated Chicano artist collective Los Four. The collective would become a major force in the Chicano Art Movement and the first Chicano artists to break through the mainstream museum barrier, earning recognition as muralists during the renowned Los Angeles mural renaissance. She and fellow member Carlos Almaraz painted murals for labor rights leader Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union, as well as community murals, such as the Ramona Gardens Housing Projects in East Los Angeles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hernández’s inclusion in museum and gallery exhibitions in California began immediately following graduation from Otis Art Institute in 1974, with landmark exhibitions at the Oakland Museum, “In Search of Aztlán"" and “The Aesthetics of Graffiti"" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. By 1983 her career moved to the national level with a solo exhibition at the venerable Cayman Gallery in New York, making her the first Chicana to extend her artistic reach beyond the West coast. The international significance of her work came in 1989 with the first exhibition of Chicano art in Europe, Les Démon des Anges, where she was one of sixteen artists whose work was part of this ground-breaking exhibition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over her 50+ year career, she has established a significant record of exhibitions and acquisitions of her work by major public institutions and private collections which include: the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, Philadelphia; the National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Blanton Museum of Art, Austin; the UCI Museum/Institute for California Art; the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art &amp; Culture; and the AltaMed Collection. She has been the recipient of the prestigious Artist-in-Residence at the Center for the Study of Race, Politics, &amp; Culture, University of Chicago; the City of Los Angeles Artist Fellowship (C.O.L.A.) and the Anonymous Was a Women Grant. In 2019, after more than 40 years, her artistic presence returned to downtown Los Angeles with a seven-story mural, “La Nueva Reina de Los Angeles,” at La Plaza Village one block north of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument District. In 2024, she became the first artist to be given a major retrospective exhibition at the new Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art &amp; Culture.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>JH:</strong> That’s right, that’s why I use pastel. I can paint, but I don’t really enjoy it as much. Although I enjoy murals. I think everything has to do with the way I was trained at Otis. The curriculum centered around the five different MFA programs—one, fine arts (painting &amp; drawing), two, design, three, ceramics, four, sculpture, five, printmaking. Once you’ve been trained the right way, you should be able to do anything in the art world. Drawing is my favorite medium because, like many people who have art in their system, it’s the first way human beings express themselves. Thanks to my training at Otis, when I needed a “day job” I was able to work as a graphic designer. I designed books, fonts, all kinds of things to support making art.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You went to Otis College of Art &amp; Design in the early 1970s, back when it was in MacArthur Park in the middle of the city. What was it like studying under Charles White—his pedagogical approach, his influence on your style and that of your peers?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I met Charlie before I was at Otis. My high school art teacher was a white woman, Eleanor Downey, the first major influential person in my life who was not in my family or related to me in any way. After I took her class in the 10th grade she arranged for me to always be in her advanced class. She cleaned out the storage room next to her classroom and said, <em>You’ll be working in here because you don’t need to be doing what they’re doing.</em> That was huge—to be a teenager and to have your own studio, you know? Mrs. Downey was a good friend of the artist Joseph Mugnaini—he illustrated all of Ray Bradbury’s books—who was a professor at Otis. He taught an extension class on Saturdays, mostly upper-class housewives. He invited me to sit in and use the live model. He said, “You don’t have to pay, just sit in the back of class.” I, of course, said I’ll be there, and on the first or second Saturday Charles White was there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During my first year at Otis—I was always a nerdy student, always trying to work to the expectations of the instructors if not my own— Charlie gave us a drawing assignment to do over the weekend: “I want a three figure composition, and I want it on the wall Monday morning so we can critique it.” I went home and spent the entire weekend doing this rather large drawing. Took it to class, put it up. When Charlie arrived he walked around silently, around and around and then stood in the middle of the room and exploded. He started swearing—“You sons of bitches this is the shit that you give me! You had the whole fucking weekend...” We sat there in our chairs and just sank. And when he finally stopped, and took a breath, he said, “The only person this does not apply to is Hernández!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also think one reason that we got along so well was his first wife Elizabeth Catlett, an African American printmaker from the forties, took him to Mexico and he absolutely adored it. One day after class, he told me, “My wife had this internship at a print atelier in Mexico City, and I got to go along. I met all these artists, and talking to them, working with them, being there with them was the first time in my life that people who were not Black treated me with respect and admiration for my work and for me as a human being.” He’s a giant of 20th century art. Social art, political art. Very few people understood how important he was back then but I think they do now.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What were the influences in class? Was it a focused curriculum or a sort of free expression to find your style like at Chouinard?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh no, Otis in those days was not like Otis today. It was a much smaller school. By and large the professors were predominantly men. Many were the children of European immigrants or recent arrivals who came after the Second World War. Most had been brilliantly educated as artists in Europe. We had these really incredible artists—all very accomplished and all trained in the classical Renaissance manner. On the first day we walked into painting class, Joe Mugnaini said, “You are here to learn <em>how</em> to make art. You will not be making masterpieces, divest yourself of that notion, that is not what you’re here to do.” They trained us from the bottom up. If you’re going to make sculpture, you’re going to build an armature and learn to make plaster, if you draw you’re going to learn how to make paper. They gave us such an incredible education. The point was, great art is the product of intelligence, imagination, and skill. In my opinion, so much art you see today is produced by artists who lack the skills to translate what they see in their heads. Many of the ideas are wonderful, but the less than stellar execution weakens the aesthetic and visual impact of work that would otherwise be outstanding.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How did politics enter your world, the desire to align your art with a political movement? Was it something you got out of Otis, or were you already interested on your own?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was a rabid Democrat. If my brother and I wanted to be Republicans she would have disowned us. She became involved in politics when she started college because she had a very progressive father. Wherever there was some kind of Democrat political thing going on, she was involved, she went to meetings, I think for a while our house was one of those places you could vote. When I was 12, we had been talking about socialism in history class, and I was looking in the paper and I noticed for a quarter you could get a subscription to the<em> Daily Worker</em>. I thought, Okay, I have a quarter. I put it in an envelope, filled out the form and sent it away and suddenly the <em>Daily Worker</em> starts coming to the house. And my mother started freaking out, saying, “This is a Communist newspaper!” And my father—who was a union man, he worked for the Southern Pacific railroad, down at the wheelhouse on Mission Road—said, “No, no, this is union stuff, it’s not communist, it’s good things.” And she’s like “they’re gonna think she’s a communist!” And he’d say, “She’s only twelve!” That’s how far back the political stuff goes.</p>

<p>My mother was born in Mexico, in Zacatecas. Both of her parents were a blend of Spanish and Indigenous peoples, which compose most of the middle and upper middle-class of Mexican society.

<p>There was an aesthetic element. The average Mexican person, or the average Indigenous person in this hemisphere—whether descended from the Aztecs or the Maya—they all have altars in their home, the dishes that are only used for decoration, and the masks on the walls. You can go into any household in East LA and you will find these colorful artifacts that are meaningful in terms of what they represent culturally. The aesthetic dimension is everywhere. In Mexico you see color everywhere, it’s in the blood.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How did you get the commission with <em>Aztlán</em>, the first Chicano studies journal? That was one of your earliest achievements, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was in 1970. I was still at Otis. I graduated high school in 1966. In ‘67 I went to East LA College, because in those days Otis required two years of general-education. I’d gone to Otis in ‘69, then I was thrown out because by that time I was getting involved in the Chicano Movement and I hated the guy that was teaching the ceramics class and I didn’t go and I failed it. When they threw me out for a year my parents were mortified. But I got a lot done that year. I became involved with a UCLA group that was part of the first Chicano Studies department, the brainchild of Juan Gómez Quiñones, a brilliant Chicano historian who was a young professor then. I was dating a guy who was in law school there, a Chicano student, who said, “Why don’t you come to this meeting with me? We’re gonna start a journal, and it might be interesting.” Juan came up to me and said, “Andrew says you’re an artist.” I said, “I’m studying to be one.” “Well we’re starting a journal and we’re going to need somebody”—he thought art was important, especially when you marry it with the written word—“I want an artist to illustrate the cover and do drawings inside.” “I can do that.” “Okay, you’re hired.” Sight unseen.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">So that’s 1970. You met Carlos Almaraz, the Mexican-American painter and key member of the Chicano art movement, at Otis, correct? Tell me a bit about that relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carlos Almaraz was one of my closest friends. We met in 1972 when we started grad school at Otis. We found we had the same sort of thoughts about so many things—artistically, politically. We wanted to be a part of the Movement because we were tired of the racism and discrimination. However, we both also had that crazy little dream—two kids from East LA who were not expected to dream about careers in fine arts—to think we could, with our college educations, make it <em>all the way</em> in the art world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carlos was probably the most talented artist the Movement ever produced. When he was very young he left home with another friend from high school, Danny Guerrero—the son of Lalo Guerrero, the famous entertainer—who was also gay, and went to New York. It nearly killed him. This was the mid-to-late 1960s. He was trying to be a minimalist painter, and although I really like his work from this period, something wasn’t working, it wasn’t <em>enough</em> for New York. He was drinking, he was doing drugs, he was close to killing himself. When he came home from New York he felt disconnected from the Chicano movement. He left before it really got going. Suddenly he had this Come-to-Jesus moment, “I gotta catch up and find my identity!” Sure enough he leaped into finding what it means to be Mexican—learning Spanish, working for Cesar Chavez. Carlos’s charm was such that he would go right over to the most important person in the room and introduce himself. People found him incredibly charming which enabled him to make important connections, becoming a face everyone knew. He became involved in everything, never said no to things, did his homework, and began to form opinions that were not only in agreement with the Movement but more imaginative and progressive. He was the force behind Los Four’s recognition and his paintings became extraordinary. Unfortunately Carlos died five years after I moved to Chicago, from complications of AIDS.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">How did you become a member of Los Four? Were you already an informal part through Almaraz, and after the LACMA show you wanted formal admittance? Or was it the show?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carlos and Frank Romero had gone to Garfield High School. They were friends. And then through Frank he met the other two, Gilbert Luján and Beto de la Rocha. They had a show at the gallery at UC Irvine they named “Los Four” because there were four of them. I think that was in ‘72—a couple years before LACMA. Hal Glicksman, who’d seen the Irvine show, told the people at LACMA about the exhibition and suggested they bring it to LACMA. By that time Carlos and I had become friends and he understood that they needed a woman if they were going to have some legitimate claim to being progressive artists, to being inclusive irrespective of gender. ASCO had a woman member, my friend Patssi Valdez was a founding member of the group and they were younger. It made these OG guys look pretty feeble. They were talking the talk—about being radicals and socialists—but they weren’t allowing in any women! So Carlos kept telling them, we should add Hernández. So I brought my portfolio over one day in ‘73, between the two shows, and they said, “She’s good, she paints like a man.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By that time it was very close to LACMA, and because I had not been in the original [UC Irvine] show—they were only displaying the original members—my work would not be included. However, every show after that I was a formal member. In fact, right after the LACMA show, “Los Four” went to the Oakland Museum in ‘74. And immediately—the Chicano artists who had never had a museum show had become the first to break through the museum barrier—with exhibitions at the Crocker, the San Francisco MoMA, all of those happened within 18 months of one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I liked these guys as human beings. I mean they were a little misogynistic, but I understood the type. I grew up with guys like these. Carlos was different, probably because he was bisexual. He was the one who had that kind of sensitivity about trying to balance things, and he’s the reason I became a member. After about a year after those shows ended, Beto and Luján were no longer active. Beto had emotional problems and Luján was married with kids, got a job...</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">What’s the scene like in LA during this period, what’s the day-to-day, who are you associating with?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We went to a million meetings—Marxist, Leninist meetings. I have my own copy of Mao’s Little Red Book that Carlos gave me because he wanted me to read the part about what Mao said about art—that all art should reflect the life of the working class and consider them an audience.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">You’ve said that the Chicano Art Movement was “the first huge body of American art that was produced in response to a socio- political situation, not the other way around,” and that you and the other members of Los Four were “soldiers in a battle.” How did you come to see art as instrumental to the goals of El Movimiento?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know who made us feel it was important? Cesar Chavez. Carlos and I would go up to the United Farm Workers headquarters in La Paz, which is up in the mountains above Bakersfield, an old TB hospital the state gave them. We would paint the banners for the big conferences. Cesar thought artists and journalists were very important to any political movement. He said every great social movement, every revolutionary movement always relied on visual symbols with which people could relate, as Mao did. Revolutionary imagery like the hammer and sickle of the Russian revolution, the posters for the Cuban revolution, the Polish [Solidarity] movement in the 1980s—you don’t need to tell anyone what those graphics mean. They’re direct and speak to the working class. Carlos also spent time working with the UFW journal that the farmworkers produced. We’d also go up there and paint Huelga murals and design posters.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Did any of the individual aspirations of being a great artist clash with the collectivist goal of the Marxist revolution? What was the environment between the groups like?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s a personal challenge. I have always thought <em>art is too important to do badly</em>. It’s like writing, you can’t have the impact you think you’re going to have if the execution isn’t great. That’s what you hope for. There is a reason that Michelangelo’s work has stood the test of time. Not only does it have incredible beauty, done in a way that is so exquisite it’s hard for others to believe such a work is man-made. The <em>Pietà</em> for instance, it’s not just a great religious sculpture of Mary holding her son, but if you’re a human being—or a visitor from Mars—you can look at amazing works like this and feel its emotional impact no matter who you are or what you believe. That takes remarkable skill, as well as a subconscious response as they stand in front of an easel and let it flow. “<em>If I was made for art, from childhood given / a prey for burning beauty to devour, / I blame the mistress I was born to serve.</em>”</p>

<p>When I think back on it now, I see how different my career would have been, how different my world would have been had the Chicano Movement not happened around me. I would have left Otis with a set of skills, like my white counterparts, and gone out in search of something interesting to paint. I might have become an okay painter with an okay career. I used to think I had been born in the wrong time but now, 76 years later, goddamn—I hit it just right. The <em>Movimiento</em> gave my work purpose.</p>

<p>But I will say this, in my humble opinion, it is the great indigenous cultures of the world who continue to preserve the willingness to see ordinary things through a magical lens. Maybe there’s something about the indigenous mind that maintains a belief in the supernatural. And maybe it isn’t real, but if you believe as a society that spirits can return, like in <em>Día de los muertos</em>, then a magical dimension of the human imagination lives on. Human creativity resides in that dimension. Children have the capacity to think in magical terms which fades as they grow—unless they’re artists! Have you read George Kubler? I read <em>The Shape of Time</em> probably two years after it was published—in the mid ‘60s. That first chapter— the whole thing about <em>actualité</em>—is so riveting for an artist, and it has obsessed me since I was a kid: “<em>Actuality is when the lighthouse is dark between flashes... the instant between the ticks of the watch... the rupture between past and future... it is the void between events.</em>”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that’s what all artists do—or at least all the good ones. I don’t think it’s anything special. I’ve always been one of those people who don’t like to overthink what I’m doing. With pastel you have to have a plan, it’s a very unforgiving medium. You can’t make a mistake, at least not a serious one, without tearing it up and starting again. There’s no painting it white. So I always have a plan. I’m 76 years old but I know how to use Photoshop. That has certainly made putting together a basic “map” much easier. When you take that small image that you’ve done in a sketchbook and enlarge it, or transfer an image to a mural-sized grid, it changes. What looked great small sometimes doesn’t work when it’s bigger. For an artist, it’s like playing chess, forcing you to find a better strategy. As a storyteller I know where I’m going with an idea. Once I start to work I let my creative dimension guide my visual decisions as the work progresses. I have cataloged images in my head since I was a kid. I wake up most mornings with something I will put on paper someday.</p>

<p class=""interviewer"">Specifically with the more challenging pieces, like the “Adam &amp; Eve” series or the “Juarez” series, is it difficult to maintain the mood throughout composition? Do you live with these worlds in your head?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>No—I don’t know about other people but—it’s just like going to work, you know? You know very well what you’re talking about—that happens first. I build the image in my head, then for me, the fun part is the mechanical challenge of bringing that image to life. But when I’m sitting in front of the easel, it’s hard to explain.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The “Adam &amp; Eve” series rolled out pretty fast. Some of the other ones have taken years. Because pastel is so unforgiving, I work on something until I reach a point where if I don’t want to ruin it—if I’ve got a good start but I’m not sure what I want to do—I put it away. There are some pieces that were in drawers for 20 years, sometimes longer. And I was right to wait, because when I finally did know, all of it became mechanical—it’s not emotional or anything like that because the plan didn’t change. It’s the way I chose to execute the plan. On my computer I’m thinking ahead to the next two or three years. I have these files and I’ve probably six or seven ideas and I choose which one to build out on paper.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well a lot of the early work doesn’t exist. It was lost in time. A lot of the paper pieces just disappeared. Between moving, and people stealing my work actually... It happened a lot in school, I finally had to stop pinning my stuff up overnight or it wouldn’t be there the next morning. I guess that’s very flattering. So there just wasn’t that much from that period. I think María Esther Fernández [Artistic Director at The Cheech Museum and curator of the retrospective] did a great job. Hopefully it will look that good in El Paso.</p>

<p>Yes. And that’ll be the last place. Pastels are very finicky. Every time you move it something falls off. Two is enough, and being in El Paso is important because of its proximity to Juarez. I’m hoping that brings attention to the largest body of work there—the “Juarez” series.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It depends on the piece. But the “Juarez” series is a reminder that young women are easy targets at the factories where they work, much like the women sacrificed by the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica. The mask represents the continuum of the brutalization of women, that women are expendable—from the Aztecs, the Mayans, the Spanish, to contemporary Mexico. Women have always paid a high price.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of it is cultural. I was in my late 20s, early 30s by then, and in my world I was getting old, <em>fast</em>, and I wasn’t married. Even though I wasn’t looking for that kind of relationship, my mother would occasionally get after me. I had been in a relationship that I thought was leading to marriage but we had a serious falling out. And that’s how I ran into Ariel’s father, on a blind date. He was a very nice guy, a nice Jewish boy, nice family. So we decided to get married.</p>

<p>At that point, no. His father was an architect and he was trained as an architect, but he never practiced architecture—he was a great architectural photographer, but he didn’t pursue that either. We lived in a loft in downtown LA, I was making art, and he thought—for himself—that he would do better in Chicago. He had a dream of returning home again—although he hadn’t lived there since he was a child—and I thought, maybe a different audience would be good for me. I was dumb enough not to have done some research. I didn’t understand how the art world worked, especially not in Chicago. I couldn’t even get <em>hired</em> at the School of the Art Institute. Here in LA I was getting shows, I was in museums, but in Chicago, <em>nada</em>. In life we often make some dumb decisions based on what your partner wants instead of what you want.

<p>Not exactly. At that point I was working on a trajectory to find an archetypal female protagonist. And if you look at the art of other Chicana artists of the time, their female figures looked very indigenous. I was looking for something more universal.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We lived in Chicago until 2010 and over the years I developed a good friendship with Carlos Tortolero, president of the National Museum of Mexican Art, who knew my reputation out here. I felt like a fish out of water for a long time until I met him. He would constantly invite me to different exhibitions that would open. And I would ignore them because I wasn’t making any art. I had no studio. Around 2004, he contacted me again. A Frida Kahlo exhibition opened at the museum. My daughter and I went to see it and I left him my business card—I was working for University of Illinois, Chicago—and by the time I got home the phone was ringing! He told his curator, “You know where artists work—<em>find her a studio</em>!” So, in 2005, I gave myself five years to get my bearings back as an artist. This was a chance I couldn’t ignore. In 2009, Carlos surprised me again. “We know you’re leaving, and so we’ve decided we’re going to give you a solo show.” And I said when? “2010.” In the same space the Frida Kahlo show had been in. This was my farewell to Chicago and my rebirth in LA. I’ve made up for a lot of lost time. But you know, even when I wasn’t making art in Chicago, I thought about it everyday, saving images in my head.</p>

<p>It’s getting better. Except LACMA—I don’t know what’s going on there. Why would a museum spend a shit-load of money to make it <em>smaller</em>? I question whether you’ll see artists of color there much. Fortunately, Chicanos have a growing professional class who have deep pockets and who support the arts. That’s what we lacked for a long time. Since the Cheech opened, two other Chicano/Latino museums are rumored to be in the works. After a five-decade career, I find myself represented by a Westside gallery and selling work. Good things come to those who wait.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph"">""The big joke on democracy is that it gives its mortal enemies the tools to its own destruction."" —Josef Goebbels<br>

<p><em>In the days before the election of 2024, I took a bus from New York to Philadelphia, to doorknock for Kamala Harris in a swing state. The Harris campaign was organized, disciplined, and focused, dispatching volunteers from all around the country and beyond—the authoritarian threat that Donald Trump represents has focused minds across all borders—to neighborhoods all over the city.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>In training, we were given a cringe-inducing script to read on canvassed doorsteps (“I’m talking to folks in your neighborhood about Vice President Kamala Harris because she’s just like us…”). We were told we could discard this script, and we did.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Over several days, I worked shabby but comfortable middle class areas, suburban streets of imposing brick houses, gentrifying neighborhoods of young professionals, and slum areas in which decaying row houses stood among the garbage and broken furniture on their porches. Houses in all of these neighborhoods had internet doorbells. The campaign had already blanketed the city. Some of these citizens were being knocked for the fifth time.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Although the polls were reporting a close race, it seemed inconceivable that Harris could lose: that the only president in American history to have attempted to stay in power after losing an election, an obviously personality-disordered sociopath bent on revenge against the democratic institutions he had not been able to defeat four years ago, a thug and an enemy of the rule of law, could be returned to office. Surely Americans have more respect for our history and political values – indeed more respect for ourselves as citizens and human beings – than to allow this? Indeed, the volunteers were uniformly fired up: “She’s going to win, there’s no doubt.” A canvassing captain told me that women would put Harris over the top. “The number one Google search this week was, ‘Will my husband know how I voted?’”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>This was sociologically disturbing but electorally encouraging: are the polls missing these armies of women voters, afraid to be overheard expressing their support for Harris? I was skeptical. My own Google search of Google searches did not confirm this anecdote. We wanted to believe it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>And yet, one quiet bright autumn morning, the sun shining down through the trees on a street planted with Harris signs, wind swirling the fallen leaves on the lawns, a sense of doom found me. A Trump restoration seemed all too plausible, with all of its implications: the end of the Republic, of the rights of citizens, of a stable world order, fed to the fires of a mass hallucination.</em></p>

<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve always had strange men among us, men who believe that it is their destiny to rule the world. Most of us avoid these people, as they go about an isolated existence, mumbling to themselves of enemies and conspiracies that only they can vanquish. Sometimes their lives will erupt into acts of savage violence, directed against themselves or others. Much more rarely, such a man—a failed artist, say, or a failed seminarian, or a failed real estate developer—will find himself on a stage, with thousands of people screaming his name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the November 5<sup>th</sup> vote, there are any number of explanations for the normal candidate’s loss. Inflation, racism, Ukraine, misogyny, Gaza. The need of the rural working class to be “seen,” the cultural sidelining of men. Trans women in women’s spaces. It all seems&nbsp; as surreal as it does irrelevant. The American public voted to reinstate the one president in the nation’s history who refused to leave office after losing an election; who has displayed nothing but contempt for law, custom, and propriety. He won <em>all </em>of the swing states. And a plurality of the popular vote, constitutionally irrelevant but of great importance to the perception of legitimacy. It is a tremendous humiliation for a nation that aspires to be a nation of laws.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Donald Trump, in office or on the campaign trail, is not like any other American president. It is not the incompetence that sets him apart, the proud know-nothing refusal to engage the facts of the world; we’ve had presidents like that before, notably a string of failures prior to the Civil War. We’ve had corrupt presidents, dishonest ones, vicious ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What makes Trump unique as a political leader is his malignant narcissism, the vortex of his psychological need that makes him the sole reference point of political administration. Other presidents lied out of political expediency, out of fear, to protect allies or henchmen, to avoid responsibility. Other presidents were corrupt as an opportunistic sideline, or out of nepotistic indulgence. Other presidents broke the law because they found it in the way of their policy goals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Trump, the corruption, the lies, the lawbreaking <em>are</em> the policy. They are central to the existential meaning of his leadership, which is to exalt his infallibility. They are his claim to control reality itself, much as a Sharpie pen, in his magical hand, could control the course of a hurricane. His personality is inimical to the institutions that have evolved to protect American democracy, not merely the formal constitutional protections of rights, but more importantly the informal conventions and protocols that democracy absolutely depends on: a politically insulated Civil Service, a mechanism for investigating wrongdoing in the executive branch that sidelines officers serving the executive, judicial review of presidential actions. Respect, forbearance, and an assumption of good faith between political parties. A military scrupulously separated from politics. The tradition of a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMLmaZ8hUwM"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">gracious concession following an election loss</a>. Cooperation and collegiality between an incoming and outgoing president, even when they are rivals from different parties; and political silence from ex-presidents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trump has undermined and attacked every one of these conventions, and in a second term he will attempt to destroy them. It’s not that he rejects the premise behind them; it’s not even that he doesn’t understand that premise. It’s that his disordered personality makes it <em>impossible </em>for him to understand it. The rituals and performances of public life exist to feed his narcissism. He insists on massive military parades, in defiance of American military tradition, because he imagines they proclaim his personal strength; and banishes disabled veterans from the event, because their visibility “<a href=""https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/1622860/doesnt-look-good-for-me-trump-sought-to-exclude-wounded-veterans-from-parade/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">doesn’t look good for me</a>.” His only criterion for analyzing the bizarre QAnon conspiracy theory is that “<a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-qanon-conspiracy-theory-suppose-be-bad-thing-n1237358"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">they like me very much</a>.” Trump in office did not have policies, and did not understand nor respect the policy-making process. He had narcissistic whims; usually whims that played on his deep need to appear to be “strong,” as a weak man conceives of strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In international relations, “<a href=""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x497imq"">I like people who like me</a>.” Trade policies, geostrategic imperatives, human rights positions, political freedoms—all of these are less important than a leader who “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2017/05/02/526520042/6-strongmen-trumps-praised-and-the-conflicts-it-presents"">says nice things about me</a>.” To Trump, foreign policy springs from personal relationships among leaders and depends on other leaders’ praise for him – an orientation that opens obvious opportunities for gains by authoritarian states at American expense, on the trivial cost of a bit of flattery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A generation ago, it would have been impossible for such an obviously damaged person to be taken seriously as a presidential candidate. Over the last 30 years, we have increasingly lived in a social media environment that has invited us to create, share, and voyeuristically consume a common digital life. It is not so much that Trump’s narcissistic approach to the presidency has been normalized, although it has; it is that solipsistic self-reference has eaten the larger culture, in an omnipresent twilight of “influencers,” cultural activists, conspiracists, and fame junkies fed by radicalizing algorithms seeking eyeballs for the next sponsored video. Our politics has less and less connection to any actual reality. We put ourselves on display 24/7, and the confessional style in public life is as normal as loud cell phone conversations on public buses. We are all narcissists now, and the destructive narcissism of the leader reflects and magnifies the aspirational narcissism of his devoted followers. Like all systems built on spectacle and cruelty, the unraveling of democracy has a performative aspect that feeds popular enthusiasm for the most flamboyant strongman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such a moment has produced a leader who came to public attention as the host of a reality show in which he was portrayed as a masterful businessman, sharp, decisive, and competent. None of this was true; Trump made terrible business decisions in real life, got into unmanageable debt, and declared bankruptcy six times, leaving his hapless investors, employees, and contractors holding the bag. But the show created its own narrative, and played to the audience’s most base and bullying instincts—and would have pushed things further, had its star been allowed to. Trump wanted to pit a team of black contestants against a team of white ones. This impulse predicts much about the nature of Trump’s campaigns—and of his behavior in office.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A radical, destabilizing oligarchy at the head of a pixel-drunk mob has seen the opportunity in a world in which the idea of respectable public media is no longer associated with fact-checkers and gatekeepers, Artificial Intelligence is being deployed against democracy, and the far right has been hammering on conventions of pluralism, truthfulness, and respectful disagreement since the days of Newt Gingrich in the mid-1990s. Its program of tribalizing and demonizing politics, while deploying an alliance with both informal and corporate post-truth media, has not only turned politics into a blood sport. It has turned politics into entertainment. It is telling that not only does the truth now not matter to many; it is admitted and acknowledged not to matter. The point is the tribal performance of a political identity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I can think of democracies that were crushed by authoritarian neighbors. I can think of egalitarian societies that succumbed to an oligarchic elite, and of reforming monarchies that were swept away by totalitarian revolutions. I can think of societies that offered some broad degree of political autonomy to their citizens and institutions that were hijacked by ambitious dictators who consolidated power. What I cannot think of in history before now is an established, longtime democracy, with strong democratic institutions and an historic if imperfect dedication to the rule of law, in which a broadly enfranchised electorate voluntarily voted to enthrone a person who aspires to be a dictator.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Trump has his way, the vast administrative apparatus of policy-making, of institutional review, of rules and regulations and laws—the necessary insulation of power in a democracy—will be jettisoned in his war on the “deep state”—which is to say, the process-based foundations of democracy that diffuse and check power. Whereas in his first term&nbsp;Trump believed only in ignorance that the American president held unfettered power, he now knows what he needs to do to actually achieve it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The system is much more fragile than we had assumed. There were multiple opportunities for a healthy democracy to assert itself against Trump’s narcissism. The Republican Party could have taken seriously the traditional role of political parties as gatekeepers, blocking Trump from the nomination in 2016 and 2024. The Senate could have acted honorably and convicted Trump when he was impeached in 2019 and especially in 2021, when the magnitude of his assault on the Constitution was beyond any doubt. The justice system could have moved much more quickly to charge and convict him on election fraud and insurrection charges. The states could have refused him access to their ballots as an insurrectionist. And, of course, the people could have valued democracy enough to vote against him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of these things happened. Instead, the Supreme Court held Trump above the law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where might we as a nation go in the course of a second, much less restrained Trump presidency? The political culture is moving very fast, in all kinds of ways. One of the reasons that a trial of Trump’s <em>serious</em> crimes—who cares about hush money paid to a porn star?—was so important for the nation was that a demonstrated duty to impartial justice would have served to shore up our institutions. That’s not going to happen now. Instead, our public servants who have demonstrated the highest degree of integrity in attempting to prosecute Trump may well be targeted by the corrupted power of the presidency. We are now fully exposed to the coming hurricane of venality, incompetence, corruption, and authoritarianism, and we should be prepared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Americans have been smug about our leadership of the free world since 1945, and after 1989 we got used to thinking of liberal democracy as the inexorable trend of history. But there was nothing in its very brief timescale that warranted such a projection. Maybe it was just the most temporary of blips, presaging nothing more than a quick reversion to normal&nbsp;autocracy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve always known that there will come a day when the United States is no longer a democracy, and a day when it no longer exists. But until recently, I never thought these things could happen in my own lifetime.</p>

<p class=""unindented"">I wish I was emailing you under better circumstances. It is like several square miles of our neighborhood was carpet-bombed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had been prepared for a weather disaster a week before by our neighborhood amateur climatologist, Edgar McGregor. We knew it had the possibility of hurricane force winds, so many of us had prepared go-bags. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Monday night was a windstorm I never experienced before. In the morning, fences were down and limbs from trees on our property. The rest of the area had trees down and multiple power outages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We spent Tuesday doing some clean-up and putting some personals in our cars. The winds started picking up again around sunset and just after it got dark there were several short power glitches. We then received a notification from Edgar that basically said, “Get out.” We went outside and saw a large orange glow from the east. The fire started under a power transmission line in Eaton Canyon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were in the SET stage of the local READY, SET, GO alerts from the Watch Duty app. But we decided that with the winds howling we should <em>go</em>. We’re lucky we did when we did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Leaving was hectic and traffic was slow as power and lights were out in some areas and the streets were still littered with downed trees and garbage cans from trash day. Lots of confusion and no sign of the authorities. We made our way down to my partner's parents' house in San Juan Capistrano and watched what news we could find. I don’t really remember much from that evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just about 6 AM I received a fire alarm notification from our system. I figured the house was gone. I did continue to receive intermittent alerts through the morning which gave me hope our place had survived. 11:59AM all sensors went haywire, sending multiple alerts to my phone. Motion sensor east hall. Glass break guest room. Patio door open, front door open, west hallway motion sensor, panel overheat, panel shut down. Then silence.</p>

<p class=""indented"">We got in my SUV, gassed up, and went back to Altadena. When we managed to navigate through the downed trees and communication and power lines draped across the streets, we got to our place which was still on fire. Most houses in the neighborhood were gone, no flames remaining. I’m guessing ours was the last to go in the conflagration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we were leaving we couldn’t fathom the destruction would be this bad. We figured some houses near the Angeles National Forest would be lost, but we never expected we’d never see ours again.</p>

<p class=""indented"">We are now trying to navigate our next steps.

Response was overwhelming and made us even more emotional at the love and support of our friends and family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now lots of paperwork, waiting on our insurance, and FEMA. Having to acquire lost medications. Our insurance changed on Jan 1 and we don’t even have ID cards yet, so that has been difficult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There have been daily updates at 08:00 and 16:00 and they seem disorganized and unprepared for what’s happened. I got in touch with our Supervisor Kathryn Barger and Assemblyperson John Harabedian for answers. Friday evening was the first time I felt there was some glimmer of organization.</p>

<p class=""openingParagraph""><em>All too soon, a two-part exhibition of works by Ariel Parkinson (1926-2017) closed January 25-26, at House of Seiko in San Francisco.<br><br>
Where to begin—or end—with Ariel, as she always signed herself? From a privileged childhood in Piedmont, California, which extended to excursions on William Randolph Hearst’s private train into Mexico, she went on to Scripps College during the war, to art studies in Paris and Rome in the pinched, cold, European Postwar, to her defining years in San Francisco at mid-century, when she taught literature at Mills College and studied under Rothko and Still at the San Francisco Art Institute. She was married to Tom Parkinson, the poet and Yeats scholar, and forged vital personal connections with the poets of the San Francisco Renaissance, most strongly Robert Duncan, and later with the Beats, most affectionately Allen Ginsberg and, as it were, environmentally, with Gary Snyder.<br><br>
Her old and eminent friend the art historian Peter Selz later wrote: “Ariel’s work as a painter, sculptor, and designer, as well as her long immersion in literature and poetry, all found their synthesis in her theater designs”; the latter, as Thomas Albright wrote, were distinguished by “dramatic, Wagnerian settings of fire and mist.” In her works the myth-haunted mid-century is preserved in forms large and small, from caricatures to minatory beasts. But she was, always, an activist and, increasingly with the decades, a polemical artist of formidable power and ambition. In her memoir, </em>Ariel<em> (2012), she titled the chapter on the Sixties “Playing Hardball.” Another is called “Intrusion in Space and Other Matters.” It’s a lot to cover, but Zully Adler, the organizer of this exhibition, provides an incisive and eloquent précis of a long, gallant, and singular career (reprinted below). The show was a wonder to behold.<br>

<p class=""unindented""><strong>For every chapter of Bay Area bohemianism</strong> there was also Ariel, carving her own channels between what she called “Beat then Hip, then Rock, Love, the Natural World.” At first, in the late 1940s, she found herself among the poets and playwrights of the so-called Berkeley Bunch. Younger than many and one of few women, she maintained a sharp and sometimes ironic distance from their oblivious masculinity, even if she also enjoyed their “pacifist, anarcho-syndicalist, syncretist, pan-cultural gatherings.” Then she studied at the California School of Fine Arts, painting under Hassel Smith when “Dream was in, and Cosmos.” After that, the dawn of the hippie movement, walking to the Human Be-In with her young friend Allen Ginsberg and holding a sign that read “I Represent the Lower Animals.”</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Sensitive as she was to new tendencies and social change, Ariel also maintained old-world decorum and an archaic, arch-romantic sensibility. San Francisco critic Alfred Frankenstein compared her to William Blake, as if her work belonged to a previous century. Her style skews surreal and whimsical, with a grotesque undercurrent drawn from the darker elements of Art Nouveau. It is seductive but also repellent, producing what she called “the posture of cruel joy”—like the Worm Queen from her friend Helen Adam’s San Francisco’s Burning: A Ballad Opera:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<p class=""blockQuote"">My crown is crusted with carrion flies<br>
And my head is bald and wet,<br>
But the loveliest woman of living flesh<br>
With you will quite forget.</p>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Ariel’s imagery finds its closest companions with characters like this. For her, art was storytelling, and painting carried “the piercing, noble, haunted power to imagine.” Many pieces reference Shakespeare, the Brothers Grimm, and classical mythology. Others conjure what she called the “mists and tempests, sea foam, clouds, smoke, waves” found in the prose of Ruskin. It may have helped that she lectured in English at Mills College, that her husband was the revered poet and professor Tom Parkinson, and that her friends were largely writers. Ariel herself wrote with the verbosity and prosody of a Victorian in recital: “Beyond the writhing fish and the live chickens, the glowing fruit, and the towering gold and cream of Italian baking, glimpses of city towers, glimpses of the grey-green, wind-battered surface of the bay.” That’s San Francisco. Over the decades, she committed increasing efforts to illustration and costume design for opera, ballet, and theater, her artwork put in the service of the stories that inspired her in the first place.</p>

<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Ariel’s creative anchor was always nature. Specifically, “the California of John Muir, Ishi, and Kroeber.” When stuck in the city, she could turn to what Gary Snyder called the inner wilderness, an interior plain of marshes and tidepools overgrown with “Ur-vegetation.” The work that emerged from this wilderness allowed Ariel to found a movement of one: bio-classicism. And when one curator dismissed her painting as a puddle of swamp water, the artist was undisturbed. She drew harsh caricatures of industrial barons and other enemies of the planet. More becoming drawings graced protest banners and guidance on a new municipal project known as recycling. Ariel became a thorn in the side of the Solid Waste Management board. “Garbage is simply resources out of place, and I was its Joan of Arc.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Ultimately, she left the project of recycling behind and made convincing arguments for doing away with packaging entirely. Whether fearsome, dainty, erotic, or in dissent, the artworks of Ariel are guided by the senses. Paintings and drawings emerged from what she called “various admixtures and applications of the pleasure principle.” Nature was something to safeguard in part because it was interesting to see, feel, smell, and taste. Watching her watercolor spread is satisfying; her human figures are voluptuous. The writers and artists in her company—Robert Duncan, Anaïs Nin, Jack Spicer, Jess, Kenneth Rexroth, Norman O. Brown—were not so different. They exalted feelings, even ugly ones, for how much they could be felt. Neither Ariel nor the Worm Queen play favorites in this realm. They provoke goosebumps as much as induce repose. In the inner wilderness, sensations are vital, but they won’t always make you feel better.</p>

3803,"A Love Letter to a Roundabout","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>I USED TO COME TO THE NEWINGTON GREEN ROUNDABOUT </strong>every Friday. Opening my front door, I’d turn right past the chip shop, pause at the top of the road for a lull in traffic, and then cross into the center of the roundabout. Sitting on a wooden bench on the north side of the Green, surrounded by buses, chatter and bird song, connected me to the area. It was a method of rooting myself amid the displacement of the rental market, where every home is temporary and it's difficult to feel fully situated. On a damp bench through changing weather, I thought a lot about the roundabout as metaphor for making common ground: Here in the middle of the metropolis, this junction deconstructed the solitary self and the fiction of non-dependence. At least, that's how it seemed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now I live in a neighbourhood where the rent’s cheap(ish), but there are less roundabouts and no shared spaces within them. In a city like London, where so much of the urban landscape is locked-off, public spaces that facilitate connection feel precious, unlikely, extraordinary. What was once Middlesex Forest is now the built-up boroughs of: Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Hillingdon and Hounslow, etc. A few scraps remain, and the center of this roundabout is one of them: a circle of common space that somehow survives; ancient oak trees stretching through the skyline.</p>

<p>In 1480 this roundabout was part of Middlesex Forest. There were wild boars, deer, bulls. Later, King Henry VIII built a hunting lodge by the south side of the Green. Aristocrats resided here and carcasses were hung out to dry. By 1742 the Green was deemed too wild, so the residents fenced it in: They laid out grass plots and gravel walks, and measured a safe distance of forty-five feet between the houses and the newly-enclosed square. A century later the local council acquired the space. Among the beeches and oaks, they planted plane trees, shrubberies, circular flower beds.</p>

3829,"To Georgia and Back","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>With the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah</strong> looming—the first anniversary of the October 7 attacks on the Hebrew calendar—my wife and I decided to take our three girls (ages five, three, and two) away for a week-long trip. Most flights in and out of Israel were cancelled, so we planned a trip to Georgia, the country where my father and grandfather were born and raised. We told the girls and, for a moment, our eldest’s eyes lit up, until, eyebrows furrowed, she asked, “Is it a dangerous place?” I said, “We wouldn’t take you to a dangerous place.” Again she thought and asked, “But didn’t they put your grandpa in jail?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About a month earlier, I mentioned to some acquaintances that my grandfather had served in the prison camp of Rustavi. Our eldest heard me. “Really?” she asked. I was caught off guard but managed to explain that, back when he was alive, police in Georgia often put people in jail who did not deserve to be there. Hers wasn’t purely a historical question. Since the October 7 attacks, kids in their kindergarten had told all kinds of stories about how their fathers caught Hamasniks and put them in jail. The older bullies scared younger kids by saying they would put them in jail too. Our girls came home afraid.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">But there was another reason behind her concern about danger: On October 1, 2024, Iran had attacked Israel with an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles. The sirens wailed during bedtime. Our apartment was built in the early 1930s and has no bomb shelter. We sat next to our front door, the girls looking at us in fear as interceptor missiles shook our windows. When the sirens stopped, the eldest asked what had happened. I told her that there was a country that was trying to boom us, and that the army was sending booms into the air to stop their booms. “So why don’t we move to that country?” she asked. “Well,” I said, “now that they tried to boom us, our army will probably boom theirs.” Rather than inciting feelings of hate or revenge, I presented it as a tragic reality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of this informed our decision to take a trip a week later. But the respite was short. At the airport, sirens began to wail—a missile attack from the north—and we had to run to a crowded safe zone until the danger passed and we were able to board our flight. Later, on the plane, we settled them into some simple activities like drawing. As she drew her favorite shape—a rainbow—our eldest looked up and asked, “Are there sirens in Georgia?” I told her that, no, there were no sirens in Georgia. At least not as far as I knew.</p>

<p class=""indented"">It was night when our plane landed in Batumi. We were met at the airport by our host, Jemal, who ran a guesthouse out of his farmstead in Merisi, an hour and a half drive into the mountains. In the car, as everyone else fell asleep, Jemal and I conversed in Russian. I told him about my great-grandfather, a soldier in the Imperial Russian Army who’d survived World War One and fled to Tbilisi when the Bolsheviks entered Kyiv in 1917. He told me about his great-grandfather, an Imperial Russian police officer stationed in Batumi when Stalin was active. His great-grandfather was arrested twice—once after the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic was created, being released after several months, and again in 1937, during Stalin’s Great Purge, when he was executed. No one knew why, he said, until recently, when a village elder whispered that, during Stalin’s arrest, his great-grandfather had beaten the dictator-to-be.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">At Jemal’s guesthouse, we learned about the culture they had preserved during seven decades of Soviet rule. Jemal’s family was known as the custodians of traditional choral singing that went back centuries, from the time of Ottoman rule over the region, through the Russo-Turkish War, and the takeover of the region by the Russian Empire. On our first morning, he took us along into town to watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEcPvwVgAJs"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">a rehearsal of their choir, Mokvare</a>. Back at the guesthouse, he told us about a song from the village in which the locals sang an homage to the grape vine that could not be made into wine because of the Muslim edict against drinking alcohol. While the region is still considered Muslim, many locals have gone back to wine-making, including Jemal, who makes 800 liters a year. In the mid-2000s, they were discovered by American ethnomusicologists, who brought groups to their home. The pandemic put their guest house in danger of closing, but by late 2021, people from Europe were booking again, eager to study—until the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when their guests began to cancel. In recent years, they relied on what Jemal called “post-Soviet people”—groups from the Former Soviet Union led around by guides and uninterested in any cultural exchange.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only other people staying with Jemal’s family while we were there were an Australian couple. The young man had fallen in love with this region’s culture and music and spent two years living and working with Jemal’s family. He had brought his girlfriend to meet his “Georgian parents.” On our first morning there, I noticed the young man reading Edward Said’s <em>Orientalism</em>, and the young woman’s water bottle sporting a big sticker reading FREE PALESTINE. I was worried about tension as a result of our being Israeli, so I carefully engaged them on the issues—some of our own experiences as well as the writing I’d done criticizing the government and its policies. We acknowledged each other’s concerns and fears about a world ruled by hate and violence, and I told them how much I appreciated their lack of prejudice toward us. The young woman said, “I fight police, not people.” The young man said they came from a country with one of the clearest histories of settler-colonial genocide. “If we didn’t believe there were leftists in Israel,” he said, “we’d have no right to exist as leftists in Australia.” The kids particularly connected with them, and we saw that, on this mountain, even if we could not escape the war, we could form a microcosm guided not by aggression but tolerance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<div class=""paragraphDivider""></div>
<!-- /wp:html -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Australian couple left in the middle of our stay. Jemal took them to Batumi, and we hitched a ride to spend a few hours in the city, ending up at a cafe in the old part of town. Our girls, ever precocious, asked the man working at the counter his name. He said Ivan. I asked him where he was from and he said Ukraine. I asked how long he’d been in Batumi. He said two and a half years—ever since the Russian invasion. A young woman walked into the cafe who turned out to be his wife. She was quiet but opened up when I told her I spoke Russian. She and Ivan had lived in Russia. He was a professional drummer and she was a ballerina. They had come to Batumi because they’d seen a lively European cultural outpost. But after the war in Ukraine broke out, Europeans stopped coming. Like Jemal, they were catering to groups of post-Soviets guided around in herds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We spent Shabbat at the guesthouse, Jemal teaching the girls learning to make wine and his wife Manana teaching them to make dumplings. The rest of the time, they played with Elpiteh, the recently-born calf. The weather turned cold and rainy, and we didn’t want to burden his family with cooped up kids, so we spent the last two nights at a hotel. At a stationary store, we bought the girls modeling clay. The eldest took all of the pieces and created a landscape that included flowers, trees, mushrooms, and a car driving up a mountain road. Our days with Jemal’s family had entered her imagination. At that moment, I saw that this trip had given her and her sisters a taste of the flavors and sights that had animated my own family’s history. Somewhere, in the depths of their memories, we now shared the spirit of Georgia as one of our cultural legacies.</p>

<p>On our day of return, the girls started getting nervous. Our eldest asked whether there would be sirens at the Batumi airport. I said it was unlikely. Her sister asked whether there would be sirens back home. I said I didn’t think so. Our flight was delayed—there had been a drone attack from the north again and the Tel Aviv airport had been closed for a short period—but eventually we made it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was now Simhat Torah, the first anniversary of the attacks that woke us <em>into</em> a nightmare from which neither we nor anyone in the region will likely ever fully awaken. But the trip to Georgia showed me that some of us survive wars—not just physically but also spiritually—by preserving culture. I had seen a family that maintained its traditions despite repeated loss and adversity, continuing its ancient ways even when a world obsessed with power brought new threats. And I knew that we had done something good for the girls when, at our friend’s house, having been served a glass of milk, they asked, “Do you have a cow?”</p>

3847,"Adventures—and Meanings—Down the Oxford High","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>What do we <em>mean </em>by “Oxford philosophy”</strong>—aka “Oxford linguistic philosophy,” “Oxford analytical philosophy”?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the historian of a philosophical movement that he dates from 1900 to 1960, it was all about “a terribly serious <em>adventure</em>” (drawing on the thoughts of physicist Ernest Nagel). Whence the title to Nikhil Krishnan’s survey of the evolution of a way of doing philosophy that, spawned in that magnificent city-state of Oxford, mother to all Anglophone academic institutions (not excluding Cambridge and the latter’s irascible infants at Harvard and Berkeley), subsequently flooded that same Anglophone academic world from the 1960s on with its priorities, prejudices, and eccentricities—and with only relatively recent hints at a final, thankful ebbing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An Adventure rooted in endless intellectual flurries around the central task: “what do we <em>mean</em> by saying…?” Ultimately the answer, if answer there was, would be: diversity, discontinuity, discrepancy. But not before some worthy exceptions could be recorded. In handling the range and specificities of his inquiry, Krishnan candidly chooses as his “basic unit of organization” the “anecdote.” This runs the risk of splaying out a bevy of quasi-prurient tidbits. Thus the warden of Wadham College Maurice Bowra specifies as his standard for applicants: “clever boys, interesting boys, pretty boys—no shits.” Renowned German classicist Eduard Fraenkel enjoys his bit of “energetic pawing,” at least one victim, Mary Wilson (future “Warnock”), forced to undergo the humiliation of “a long series of fumblings with the buttons on her blouse.” While at Christchurch College <em>roué</em> A. J. Ayer avidly brings in “the booze and guests (only men allowed),” with philosophy notable Gilbert Ryle drinking “like a champion” as he downs “a pint of beer in five seconds,” even while the “discussion” rambles on along “naughty but learned epigrams in dead languages.” After all, is this not the very same moral environment in which Alice had in an earlier generation pranced through her wacko adventures in Wonderland?</p>

<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Fortunately, Krishnan is equally ready and capable of rounding out the more serious resonances of the extensive series of philosophical <em>agons</em> highlighting his Oxford time period: Viennese logical positivist convert A. J. Ayer taking on that imperturbable&nbsp; defender of Common Sense J. L. Austin, Wittgensteinian acolyte Elizabeth Anscombe reducing to epistemological rubble the ethical command theories of R. M. Hare, indeed a whole series of critiques of the Oxford school from within by Bernard Williams, Herbert Marcuse, and Stanley Cavell. Whether petty or (potentially) profound this Oxford way of doing philosophy exhilarated insiders and guests, helping to turn Oxford into “the most influential philosophy department in the world for at least ten years.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How then to frame Krishnan’s account? One necessarily begins with Krishnan’s perennial hero: J. L. Austin; indeed, Krishnan’s closing date 1960 sanctifies Austin’s unexpectedly early death. Austin, as a contemporaneous intellectual biography on Austin by M. W. Rowe more thoroughly recounts, had a remarkable career, captured in Krishnan’s narrative utilization of the twin motifs “philosophy and war.” First came the “war”: Austin’s intelligence work, particularly regarding D-Day itself, helped save thousands of lives and then helped guide Allied troops into Europe until the final surrender. He was, indeed, according to Rowe, “amongst the leading British Intelligence officers of the Second World War.” Then followed the “philosophy” as postwar Oxford absorbed the impact of Austin’s project to approach philosophical problems by applying techniques acquired through military operations—from disciplined meetings, breaking down of topics through collective attacks, to submission of extensive reports. True, over time that approach became considerably more relaxed, more “Socratic,” but Austin’s towering presence and personality sharply shaped how postwar Oxford philosophers should necessarily set about their tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What then was the philosophical import of Austin’s labors? Had he lived, the most likely candidate would have been&nbsp;a “linguistic phenomenology” mixing linguistics, semantics, and even sound symbolism, or as fellow philosopher P. F. Strawson suggests: “a general classificatory theory of acts of linguistic communication”—all to be fortified by what might well have been, shortly before his early death from lung cancer, Austin’s likely move to the University of California, Berkeley. Is this enough to highlight Austin as the core of what became Oxford linguistic or analytical philosophy? Fortunately, Krishnan’s overview is far more generous, and other figures merit an almost comparable kudos.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of them Gilbert Ryle stands out, if only for publishing the first book, <em>The Concept of Mind</em> (1949), announcing to the philosophical world the emergence of a distinctly Oxford mode of philosophizing (Austin’s immediate post-1946 contributions largely came out in later edited publications). Krishnan rummages around the point of Ryle’s rant against any philosophy still strongly stained by the Cartesian distinctions of body and mind (“the Ghost in the Machine”) before coming up with Ryle’s contribution to the discussion. All such distinctions betray nothing less than a “category” mistake: “the presentation of fact belonging to one category in the idioms appropriate to another.” No less remarkably, the book depends on the epigram for its arguments as Ryle piles them up, less to support arguments than to elicit characters “like a novel set at the village fête.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then there is that perpetual gadfly A. J. Ayer whose <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em> (1936) would drill Oxonians to entertain the sublimity of a reductionist epistemology dismissive largely of ethics, aesthetics, and especially religion. Ayer’s campaigns kept everyone on their common-sense toes, especially after he ascended in 1959 to the Oxford chair of logic when he eventually pieced together his somewhat rambling version of his favored Bertrand Russell’s philosophical pragmatics. And perhaps most significant for gender concerns, Krishnan judiciously shows how the temporary wartime conditions that denuded Oxford of its male components allowed women philosophers to flourish. Although the postwar did bring back the males and a bit of retreat, such female philosophy stalwarts as Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Scrutton (future ""Midgley""), Iris Murdoch and Philippa Foote, among others, continued to make powerful future contributions to ethical and political theorizing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like utilizing Cerný’s scale exercises before embarking on Mozart’s keyboard masterpieces, the Austin-Ryle combo was probably therapeutic for serving the more substantive endeavors to follow by the date of Krishnan’s 1960 closure. These included Isaiah Berlin’s provocative 1958 distinction between “positive” and “negative” political liberty, Stuart Hampshire’s 1959 robust rereading of the relations between thought and action or intention, H. L. A. Hart’s 1961 influential rejection of a command basis for law, and, most importantly, P. F. Strawson’s “wild” 1959 bid to articulate, within the severe terms of contemporary analytical theorizing, a genuine metaphysics, however “descriptive.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""className"":""indented""} -->
<p class=""indented"">Nonetheless, if the aim is to genuinely draw out the historical impact of Oxford philosophy, recognizing this advance is also to productively tamper with Krishnan’s bracketings, for it is more helpful to skip past the somewhat arbitrary choice of Austin’s 1960 death in order to extend the story all the way to the early 1970s. Indeed, Krishnan’s own preferred eight Oxford analytical classics (besides works by Anscombe, Austin, Ayer, Hampshire, Ryle, and Strawson) include two—by Iris Murdoch and by Bernard Williams—that were only published in the early 1970s. This wider span brings, in its turn, a further concern about Krishnan’s coverage.&nbsp;Although he does raise political events here and there, no consistent account of the story of post-World War II Britain, a power that was moving grudgingly from the decline and collapse of one of the world’s more imposing empires to a more modest membership into a larger European Union by 1973-1975, is provided to undergird what was happening to Oxford itself. In this regard Krishnan even fails to cover in sufficient clarity important changes to the Oxford world proper since his chosen 1900s.&nbsp;From Evelyn Waugh’s “city of aquatint” occupied by only some thousand primarily male aesthetes, through the later postwar jump in numbers driven by a massive influx of veterans, to the 1966 Franks Commission Report spanking Oxford for its furtiveness, relative neglect of research, and lack of “social justice,” the university rode squall after squall, the hurricane eye of which could only be occupied for so long by Krishnan’s cultural world.</p>

<p class=""indented"">For that matter, Krishnan’s account should have been more charitable to the outsider reader who may be understandably ignorant of the strange world that has been “Oxford” ever since its probable origins around 1171—incidentally a full half-millennium before America’s 1636 Harvard. One is thrown into a world comprising a very unique compromise and contestation between something called a University and a bevy of semi-autonomous Colleges—some obscenely rich for having themselves functioned since, as in the case of Merton College, 1264—going through changes and refashionings that have absorbed late Medieval, Renaissance, Jacobin, Enlightenment, Modern, and—perhaps surprisingly—prosperous Contemporary factors. This Ship of erudite Fools lets outsiders into only some of its idiosyncrasies—that same outsider might consult in this regard the crochety account of Sixties politics by the “anonymously” scribbled <em>Letters of Mercurius</em> (1970), no doubt penned by that erstwhile gossip historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, and although Krishnan’s own anecdotal report has us occasionally wandering down the High to Magdalen or Merton or Christchurch Colleges, he, or his publishers, have anyway failed to be sufficiently generous with anything like a bird's-eye map of Oxford or relevant photos of his participants. Unless the history of contemporary Britain—which after all continued to be ruled by a host of Oxford graduates as prime ministers—and something like an overview of the phenomenon of Oxford itself as a literally millennial culture is brought into play, the narrower story of what Oxford analytical philosophy was about becomes unnecessarily blurred.</p>

<p>In any event, there was much else going on in Oxford philosophizing, despite all the “meanings” that the analytical philosophers hoped to extract from “thought.” The proud home of Hegelianism in its previous epochs under such luminaries as F. H. Bradley (whom T. S. Eliot worshipped), Hegel never went away entirely even during analytical philosophy’s acme period. Merton College warden and Hegelian G. R. G. Mure continued to write voluminously on his Master, Oxford philosopher Anthony Quinton calling his 1965 Hegel book “the best short book on Hegel” since 1883, while Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor then followed up with his massive Hegel study of 1975, earning him Isaiah Berlin’s chair and warming it for his own successor G. A. Cohen, the intrepid philosopher of Hegel's own acolyte Karl Marx.</p>

<p>All in all though, Krishan shows good taste in leaving us with the brightest analytical product of them all: “if Oxford philosophy could be embodied in one person, that person was Peter Strawson.” After all, Strawson could handle the ruckus around the early-century logical debates by his nuanced handling of, e.g., Bertrand Russell’s logic through one that both recognized recent gains in logical theory and highlighted continued respect for traditional Aristotelian logic; he had no fears about refocusing on the two greatest philosophers in the tradition, Aristotle and Kant, by calling on the latter for an actual metaphysics that grounded reality firmly in bodily experience within a spatio-temporal framework; and he continued to campaign for a “realism and catholic naturalism” that could be fairly added to the great Canon.&nbsp;That is more than can be claimed for (some of) the others, and accords Oxford analytical philosophy a permanence that it might not otherwise entirely merit.</p>
